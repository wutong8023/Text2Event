{"text": "Madrid train bombings of 2004, coordinated near-simultaneous attacks targeting commuter trains in Madrid on the morning of March 11, 2004. Beginning at 7:37 am and continuing for several minutes, 10 bombs exploded on four trains in and around Atocha Station in the city\u2019s centre, leaving 191 dead and more than 1,800 injured. Occurring just three days before Spain\u2019s general elections, the attacks had major political consequences.Madrid; terrorism Rescue workers evacuating the bodies of victims of a terrorist train bombing near Atocha Station, Madrid, March 11, 2004. Paul White\u2014AP/REX/Shutterstock.comBritannica Quiz History Makers: Fact or Fiction? Albert Einstein believed that mathematics problems should have very complex solutions.Both the Spanish government and the Spanish media immediately attributed the bombings to ETA, a Basque separatist organization whose campaign of violence over more than 30 years had claimed the lives of at least 800 people. Indeed, \u00c1ngel Acebes, the country\u2019s interior minister, claimed, \u201cThere is no doubt ETA is responsible.\u201d In an outpouring of grief and defiance, the following day an estimated 11 million Spaniards, including some 2.3 million in Madrid alone, participated in demonstrations against the violence and in support of the victims. This display of unity rapidly broke down, however, as the police investigation began to focus on the Islamist militant group al-Qaeda. On March 13, as the first arrests were being made, the government continued to blame ETA.That evening spontaneous protests took place in Madrid, Barcelona, and other cities as demonstrators chanted, \u201cWe want to know the truth before we vote.\u201d With some 90 percent of Spaniards opposed to Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar\u2019s support for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, the Islamic connection inevitably put Iraq back on top of the political agenda. This favoured the opposition Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 Party (PSOE), which had strongly opposed the war. On March 14 the PSOE scored an upset victory at the polls, and Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero was sworn in as prime minister three days later.In October 2007, 18 Islamic fundamentalists of mainly North African origin and three Spanish accomplices were convicted of the bombings (seven others were acquitted), which were one of Europe\u2019s deadliest terrorist attacks in the years since World War II.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Target train <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target trains <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Madrid <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target four trains <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Atocha Station <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim 191 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 1,800 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation evacuating <extra_id_0> Transporter workers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact victims <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target train <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Atocha Station <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack violence <extra_id_0> Target victims <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Observer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity al-Qaeda <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrests  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protests  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant accomplices <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Acquit acquitted <extra_id_0> Defendant others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Place Europe <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Counting civilian casualties in CIA\u2019s drone warA report released in September by human rights researchers at Stanford Law School and New York University Law School sets out to demonstrate that U.S. drone policies are \"damaging and counterproductive.\"Media outlets from CNN to BBC hailed the report as new evidence of the U.S. government\u2019s false narrative on drones and the New York Times\u2018 Scott Shane described the study as \"among the most thorough on the subject to date.\"While the Stanford-NYU report certainly presents a comprehensive review of existing drone research, its new contributions to the evidentiary record are far more modest than its sweeping conclusions would suggest.Number CrunchingThe U.S. government claims that civilian casualties caused by drones are in the \"single digits\" during Obama\u2019s years in office, while the Stanford-NYU report seeks to establish that there is significant evidence that U.S. drone strikes have killed and injured a larger number of civilians. This is a low bar, and would merely necessitate proving that more than 10 civilians have been killed by drones since Obama assumed office, a claim that has been made by all three major databases aggregating information on drone strikes. The Stanford-NYU report goes further, claiming that between 474 and 881 civilians have been killed since 2004.However, this does not represent new evidence. Stanford and NYU researchers made no attempt to offer new statistical analysis on the number of civilian casualties caused by drones. Rather, their report is essentially an extended endorsement of a database compiled by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a small team of journalists based out of City University, London. In doing so, the report rejects the findings of two other widely cited databases, The Long War Journal, which reports 138 civilian deaths and New America Foundation\u2019s Year of the Drone, which lists 152-191 civilian deaths and the deaths of 130-268 \"unknowns.\"If the Stanford-NYU team wants to paint a picture of the U.S. as a human rights abuser, then the Bureau, whose casualty statistics dwarf the more conservative estimates of the other databases, is best suited to that purpose, but that does not make it the most reliable source.While a comprehensive assessment of the Bureau\u2019s data should have been conducted before giving it a resounding endorsement, just a cursory review of its account of 2012\u2019s drone strikes reveals problems:\u2013 On May 5, 2012 the Bureau reports that a strike in North Waziristan killed 8-10 people, of whom between zero and ten are listed as civilians. Upon reviewing the accompanying sources one find that early reports said the identity of the dead could not be determined, but subsequent reports from government officials identified them as militants. Of the 15 sources cited by the Bureau, not one states that the victims were civilians.-On June 2, 2012 the Bureau reports that 2-4 people were killed and between zero and two of them were civilians. These civilian deaths were inferred based on a report that a motorbike was accidentally hit, but the Bureau fails to take note of a later report from The Express Tribune identifying the motorbike victims as suspected militants Khalil Yargul Khail and Rehmanullah Gangi Khail.-On July 23, 2012 the Bureau references 25 sources for a drone strike, only one of which described the victims as local residents and based on this the Bureau reports that up to 14 civilians were killed.The Stanford-NYU report critiques the Long War Journal for not making its data available in a verifiable strike-by-strike format, over-relying on U.S. intelligence sources, and identifying all victims as militants unless they are specifically identified as civilians. These are reasonable criticisms, but when the critique turns to New America Foundation research, it becomes logically inconsistent.While Stanford-NYU researchers admit that all three databases rely on \"the same universe of publicly available press reports,\" they criticize only the New America Foundation for over-relying on the anonymous Pakistani government officials cited in such news reports. The Stanford-NYU report laments that these officials are cited in 88% of articles referenced in New America\u2019s 2012 data but fails to consider that these same articles are referenced by the Bureau. Furthermore, the only reason the researchers were able to generate that statistic is because New America compiles a highly transparent summary of media sources relied on for each strike with a list of which sources reported which casualty estimates, something no other database provides.The Stanford-NYU report goes on to question the \"deep reporting\" capabilities of New America\u2019s sources (The New York Times, Reuters, AP, BBC, etc.) while uncritically accepting the veracity of reports from fringe outlets such as the Kuwait News Agency, the South Asian News Agency, Central Asia Online, and Punjab News, which are sometimes the sole sources for the Bureau\u2019s reports of civilian casualties.This is not to suggest that the Bureau\u2019s research is without merit, but it should be noted that it represents an interpretation of the facts with a bias toward reporting civilian casualties. The Bureau\u2019s database does not even have a category for reporting militant deaths. It seems counter-intuitive that the organization\u2019s researchers can have such absolute faith in their civilian casualty estimates, but not have the confidence to label any of the deceased as militants.And the Stanford-NYU team was not impartial. By the report\u2019s own admission, the research project it undertook in Pakistan to interview family members of drone strike victims was commissioned by Reprieve, a UK based advocacy organization. Reprieve, which filed two lawsuits on behalf of alleged drone victims in May of 2012, arranged, paid for and collaborated on many of the victim interviews conducted by the Stanford-NYU researchers.No database is perfect, but a strong argument could be made that the New America Foundation\u2019s policy of attempting to identify both militants and civilians while maintaining an explicit category for \"unknowns\" to represent the uncertainty surrounding many of the strikes is a more balanced representation of the facts. After all, if the public is to assess the efficacy of drone strikes then we need to consider the strikes that hit their targets as well as the ones that do not.Stanford and NYU\u2019s analysis of the three drone databases, in some respects, misses the forest for the trees. A comparison of the annual data collected by the Bureau with that compiled by the New America Foundation suggests that while their numbers may differ, their underlying findings are substantially similar. Both the Bureau and New America have observed a general decline in the percentage of civilian fatalities since the high in 2006, with a sharp decrease during the Obama administration. According to the Bureau\u2019s data, the proportion of civilians killed in drone strikes fell from 35 percent in 2008 under President Bush to 9 percent thus far in 2012. Similarly, New America reports that the rate of civilian and unknown casualties decreased from 23 percent in 2008 to 2 percent in 2012. This stands to reason when we consider that the Bureau tends to err on the side of assuming that unidentified dead or individuals of disputed identity are civilians, while New America prefers to accommodate ambiguity by listing \"unknowns\" and only reports a civilian or militant casualty when it is reported by two independent sources.If one takes the average number of civilian and unknown deaths counted by the New America Foundation from 2004-2012 as a percentage of the total number of people killed in drone strikes, the civilian and unknown deaths represent 15 percent of the total. The Bureau\u2019s data suggests that civilian deaths account for 22 percent of the total killed. These numbers are in fact, not so very far apart. And while the Bureau has criticized New America for reporting that in 2012, civilian deaths are approaching zero, the Bureau\u2019s own data suggests that the percentage of civilian casualties in 2012 is at nine percent, an all-time low and significantly less than the 23 percent the Bureau reports during Obama\u2019s first year in office. This suggests that the choice is not between two very different data sets, but rather two different interpretations of similar evidence. Contrary to the Stanford-NYU report\u2019s claims, the New America Foundation is not underreporting civilian casualties; its researchers have simply chosen not to feign certainty in the face of ambiguity.What They Didn\u2019t SayThe Stanford-NYU researchers also fail to incorporate evidence that might temper their claims. Their report makes numerous references to an AP investigative report that interviewed 80 villagers at the sites of the ten deadliest attacks in 2011 and 2012 but neglects its conclusions that \"a significant majority of the dead were combatants\" and the numbers of casualties gathered by AP investigators \"turned out to be very close to those given by Pakistani intelligence on the day of each strike.\"Numerous media accounts, including the LA Times, have highlighted that \"the [Stanford-NYU] study concludes that only about 2 percent of drone casualties are top militant leaders.\" The study reached no such conclusion. This claim is based on research conducted by New America and published last month on CNN. While the Stanford-NYU report summarily dismissed New America\u2019s militant and civilian casualty estimates, they have been quick to make this statistic a centerpiece of their argument. In doing so, they also take the conclusion out of context, and ignore the possible tactical utility of deliberately targeting low-level militants. Indeed, destroying communication centers, training camps and vehicles undermines the operational effectiveness of al-Qaeda and the Taliban, and quotes from operatives of the Pakistan-based Haqqani Network reveal that drones have forced them into a \"jungle existence\" where they fear for the lives on a daily basis.A second key contention of the Stanford-NYU report is that drone strikes are \"damaging and counterproductive\" to U.S. national security. However, it is shortsighted to evaluate U.S. security in isolation from Pakistani domestic order. Terrorist attacks have been a pervasive problem in Pakistan, especially since 2007. While the report references these attacks and the frequent assassinations carried out by Taliban forces, it makes no reference to recent research by an analyst at the RAND Corporation, who identifies a negative correlation between drone strikes and militant violence inside Pakistan, indicating that the rate of violence has gone down as the rate of drone strikes has gone up. Analysis by New America suggests that while only 10 percent of drone strikes target al-Qaeda operatives, approximately 50 percent hit Taliban targets and in 2009, 19 of the first 32 drone strikes targeted the organization of Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban who was ultimately responsible for the deaths of thousands of Pakistanis, and the alleged mastermind of the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Mehsud was a far greater threat to Pakistani security than that of the United States.Key FindingsThese criticisms are not to suggest that the Stanford-NYU report is without merit. The anecdotal evidence on the adverse mental health impact of drones, the economic hardships created by attacks and the restriction of movement caused by FATA residents\u2019 anxiety about potential strikes are all valuable contributions to the public\u2019s understanding of drones, as is the report\u2019s succinct and cogent summary of some of the key legal issues. Both of these topics merit further research and the teams at Stanford and NYU seem well poised to continue contributing in these areas.However it would be a mistake to unequivocally accept all of the report\u2019s conclusions or its stance on the civilian casualty debate. The U.S. government\u2019s claims that civilian casualties from drone strikes during Obama\u2019s term in office are in the single digits are manifestly untrue, but there is no need to overstate the rate of civilian deaths to make the point that drones strikes are legally suspect and morally hazardous.Meg Braun is a Rhodes Scholar and MPhil candidate in International Relations at Oxford, where she is researching the evolution of U.S. drone policy.

{"text": "Third London Attacker Named as British PM Faces Mounting CriticismLONDON \u2014\u00a0British Prime Minister Theresa May is being forced to defend her past record as the country\u2019s interior minister, and the political architect of Britain\u2019s counter-terror system, as more details emerge of the three attackers and what security agencies knew about them before their van-and-knife rampage Saturday in the heart of London.Ahead of Thursday's vote in a snap post-Brexit parliamentary election, which May called with the expectation of securing a landslide victory, the terror attack is undermining the air of dogged competence May carefully crafted as the country's home secretary, a post she held for six years and relinquished on becoming prime minister last year.Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May speaks outside 10 Downing Street after an attack on London Bridge and Borough Market left 7 people dead and dozens injured in London, June 4, 2017.Foreign Minister Boris Johnson conceded Tuesday that there were questions to answer about how the three militants slipped through the intelligence net. He was speaking as police named the third attacker as 22-year-old Italian-Moroccan Youssef Zaghba, who was on an Italian watchlist and suspected of being a foreign fighter.Born in Fez, Morocco, in 1995 to an Italian mother and a Moroccan father, Zaghba was stopped by Italian police at the Bologna airport on March 15 of last year after arousing suspicions he was going to join the Islamic State terror group to fight in Syria.Italian officials say he had a one-way ticket to Istanbul and was carrying just a small backpack. His cell phone, which was seized, contained jihadist content, including pictures and videos, and he was placed on a watchlist as a suspected foreign fighter. Italian officials say they shared intelligence on him with both the British and Moroccan security agencies.Lived in BritainThe last few years Zaghba lived in Britain, where he worked on and off at a restaurant and a hotel near Regents Park, traveling back and forth to visit his mother, who lives in Bologna.The naming of the third Islamic militant came after it emerged earlier Tuesday that the ringleader of Saturday\u2019s attack, 27-year-old British-Pakistani Khuram Shazad Butt worked for a man accused of helping to train the Islamic extremists responsible for the July 7, 2005 underground train bombings in London, Britain\u2019s first Islamist suicide attack. Fifty-two people were killed across Britain\u2019s capital in the coordinated strike and more than 700 others were injured.This is undated three photo combo handout photo issued by the Metropolitan Police on Tuesday June 6, 2017 of Khuram Shazad Butt, left, Rachid Redouane, centre and Youssef Zaghba who have been named as the suspects in Saturday's attack at London Bridge.Counterterror analysts say they are surprised that Butt remained a \"low priority\" for the security services despite his close connections to Sajeel Shahid, a 41-year-old who ran an all-Muslin gym in east London and was named in a New York court case as having helped to set up weapons training in Pakistan for the July 7 suicide bombers.\u201cIt was a blunder to have downgraded the terror threat in Britain so quickly after the Manchester bombing,\u201d said Olivier Guitta, managing director at GlobalStrat, a security and geopolitical risk firm. He says with election campaigning under way coinciding with Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, the chances of attacks were always high.Guitta, who has advised government in the past on counterterrorism, said, \u201cNo one should be surprised by the terrorism wave and which is linked to a policy of laissez-faire policy toward extremists.\u201dThe main charge leveled against May by Labour politicians and the leaders of the country\u2019s smaller parties is the large cuts she introduced on funding for Britain\u2019s police. Those cuts resulted in police personnel being drawn down from 2010 to 2016 by more than 20,000 officers.Uncertain election impactOn Monday, the opposition parties received support for their criticism from an unlikely quarter. Conservative insider Steve Hilton, the policy guru of former Prime Minister David Cameron, demanded May resign over what he termed \u201csecurity failures,\u201d which he said led to Saturday\u2019s attack and the bombing of a concert last month in Manchester.He said May should be \u201cresigning, not seeking re-election.\u201dPollsters are wary of predicting how the terrorist attacks \u2014 three in the past 10 weeks \u2014 will impact the voting on Thursday, but Labour leaders say they have renewed hope at the very least of reducing the ruling Conservative\u2019s majority as they seek to recast their campaign message in the final hours before voting as \u201cinvestment versus cuts.\u201dOn Sunday, May promised to review Britain's counterterrorism strategy, holding out the prospect of enhanced powers for the security services and longer prison sentences for extremists. May said she wants to take a tougher line with internet providers and social media businesses that allow extremist material on their sites.She warned there has been \u201cfar too much tolerance of extremism\u201d in Britain and promised to step up the fight against Islamist terrorism after the London Bridge attack, saying \u201cenough is enough.\u201dVideo sizewidthxheightpixelsBritain PM May: 'Enough is Enough'Share this video0:00:30\u25b60:00:00/0:00:30\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 1.5MB360p | 1.8MB480p | 10.5MBBritish counterterror chiefs say that while Butt was investigated in 2015, he was deemed a low risk. According to Assistant Police Commissioner Mark Rowley, he had seen \u201cnothing to show that a poor decision has been made\u201d in 2015 and that police had no evidence Butt was planning anything.Police, however, confirm they received several warnings from neighbors and associates about Butt.British police and MI5 set up in 2013 an early warning system, known as Project Danube, to help them spot when low-priority suspects might be re-engaging in violent extremism. That program appears to have failed, say critics, as it did not help them identify Khalid Masood, the militant responsible for the Westminster Bridge attack in March that killed five people.

But his opponents feared it would allow him to bypass the opposition-controlled parliament and regarded the president's decision as an attempted coup.The controversial vote comes amid protests that erupted in early April and have since claimed the lives of over 110 people. They followed an unsuccessful attempt of the Venezuelan Supreme Court to absorb the legislative power of the opposition-controlled parliament, the National Assembly.On July 16, the country's opposition has held an unofficial referendum, in which 7.2 million people took part and almost 6.4 million of them voted against the Constituent Assembly. Venezuela's population is estimated at over 31 million people.On Thursday, the Venezuelan government outlawed all protests ahead of a controversial election to the Constituent Assembly until next Tuesday.

{"text": "With 24 hours to go until the biggest election in years, here\u2019s an oddity: the Government doesn\u2019t care who you vote for. Just as long as you vote.After the opposition\u2019s do-it-yourself election, the bar is high for chavismo to prove they still represent \u201cthe majority\u201d. But how do you convince people against their hearts? Proposals from each of the candidates, presented three times a day on national radio and TV cadenas, are more a joke than a real constitutional project.Chavismo\u2019s done what it can to give Sunday\u2019s election the look-and-feel of a major political event, but they\u2019ve come up short in both substance and style. Superficially, this election is just another rumba chavista. With the catchy song, a dog dancing, and the infamous candidate La M\u00e1scara.\u201cWe\u2019re going to knock on the door of anyone who gets confused\u2026 Our message is to vote, to consolidate what we have accomplished.\u201dThe farce element runs deep here. In reality there\u2019s no sense of anticipation at all, all candidates represent the same party. Out of the 537 constituents, perhaps 7 to 10 of them will make decisions: the other fivehundred-some-odd are purely filler, there to raise their hand on command. Which ones get elected matters exclusively to the individuals involved.Still, you need to get people to vote.But the real reason to vote has nothing to do with any cute song. It\u2019s fear.Venezuela has more than two million public sector workers, and each one is well aware that la masa no est\u00e1 pa\u2019 bollos.The time for subtle coaxing and coded messages is long gone. Chavismo\u2019s get-out-the-vote strategy consists of threatening them mercilessly.Maduro already said that voters must present their ID and Carnet de la Patria at the door of every voting center, \u201cto see who votes.\u201d\u201cIf we have 15,000 workers (in a public institution), all 15,000 must vote, no excuse\u201d, PSUV leader Diosdado Cabello said as he explained the way the Carnet de la Patria allows the government to keep track of who\u2019s voted and who hasn\u2019t, in real time.\u201cWe\u2019re going to knock on the door of anyone who gets confused,\u201d Diosdado went on. \u201cOur message is to vote, to consolidate what we have accomplished.\u201dAs for vice-president Tarek El Aissami, he is leveraging the CLAP grocery distribution: \u201cWe didn\u2019t let you die. Now it\u2019s your turn to not let the revolution die\u201d.And that\u2019s a bouquet of subtlety compared to ANC candidate and brother of late President Ch\u00e1vez, Ad\u00e1n Ch\u00e1vez, who said \u201cif we have to take up arms to defend the legacy of Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro, we will\u201d.The interior Minister, N\u00e9stor Reverol, decided that the threats will not be exclusive for chavista voters, assuring that now any meeting or protest that \u201ccan affect\u201d the election is prohibited, adding that this \u201ccrime\u201d will be be punished with 5 to 10 years in prison.The economic crisis is part of the campaign. Maduro has assured us that, with the Constituyente, all economic problems will be fixed, even raising the minimum wage weeks before the election.Some of the threats are startlingly direct\u2026Money talks, even in voting centers, but governor Vielma Mora took a step forward proposing that any \u201ccompany or person\u201d who doesn\u2019t vote, shouldn\u2019t participate in the Dicom foreign exchange system. As he sees it, that would be giving dollars \u201cto right wing terrorists.\u201dIt\u2019s legitimately scary when you realize he\u2019s not alone in this line of thought.These threats have crossed the country and even reached Colombian borders. Roberth Guerra, a leader of Un Nuevo Tiempo in T\u00e1chira, denounced that \u201cpublic workers of the border, dependent of the regional and national government, have told us how the authorities intimidate them \u2013 they must sign a letter of resignation if they fail to vote, they have been threatened to lose their CLAP bags, and told that pensions for the elderly will be revoked.\u201dOn July 16th, the opposition drew its line in the sand: 7.6 million. The goal for the government is to overcome that mark. With money tight, that won\u2019t be easy.

{"text": "DIY Drone Instructable: How To Deliver a PayloadOverviewThese instructions guide you to build a DIY payload delivery drone system that can be mounted on your drone/quadcopter and used to deliver a package to any address.The smart, low-cost delivery solution uses GPS to find its destination and then employs an ultrasonic sensor to measure the ground clearance.Depending on your drone capabilities, this payload system can lift up to 2kg freight.A servo motor is used to release the payload at the desired location.This guide also provides a solution to the sensor integration problem.You can integrate GPS, servo, and ultrasonic sensors without any serial interference.DIY payload delivery drone systemComponentsBreadboardArduino Mega/UnoServo motor SG90Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04GPS module NEO-6M-001Connecting wiresA bottle capGlue/TapeHair pinBreadboardArduino Mega/UnoServo motor SG90Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04GPS module NEO-6M-001connecting wiresbottle caphair pinStep 1: Connecting the Ultrasonic SensorTake the breadboard and affix the Arduino to its one side, as shown in the picture.Now, take the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and attach it to the lower side of the breadboard.Make the connections as shown in Figure 1.Connect the pins as follows:Vcc (Ultrasonic) -> 5V (Arduino)GND (Ultrasonic) -> GND (Arduino)Trig pin (Ultrasonic) -> pin 8 (Arduino)Echo pin (Ultrasonic) -> pin 9 (Arduino)Run the following code to check if the ultrasonic sensor is functional.The Serial Monitor will show the following output:Step 2: Connecting the GPS ModuleTake the NEO-6M GPS module and insert its pins into the breadboard.Make connections as shown in Figure 2.Don\u2019t forget to download TinyGPS++ library if missing.Connect the pins as follows:Vcc (GPS module) -> 3.3V (Arduino)2GND (GPS module) -> GND (Arduino)RX pin (GPS module) -> pin 1 (Arduino)TX pin (GPS module) -> pin 0 (Arduino)Figure 2Run the following code and check if the GPS sensor is functional.DON\u2019T FORGET to remove the TX pin of GPS module from pin 0 of Arduino; otherwise, your code won\u2019t upload.Once the code is uploaded, first open Serial Monitor; then, connect the TX pin of GPS to pin 0 to view the current location of drone, time, and date.The Serial Monitor will show output:Step 3: Connecting the Bottle CapNow, take a bottle cap to prepare the payload-releasing mechanism.The mechanism itself is simple.You hook the payload on the hairpin inside the bottle cap, and when the servo moves it pulls off the hairpin from the bottle cap, resulting the payload to drop.Make holes on both sides of the cap.Attach the cap on the lower side of the breadboard, as shown in the pictures.Step 4: Connecting the ServoFirst, take a hair pin and connect it to the limb of the servo using a staple, as shown in the picture.Take the servo and attach it under the breadboard such that the hair pin passes through both the holes of the bottle cap.Connect the Servo with Arduino in the following way, as shown in Figure 3.PWM Pin (Servo) -> Pin 14 (Arduino)Vcc Pin (Servo) -> 5V (Arduino)GND Pin (Servo) -> GND (Arduino)Figure 3It will look like this when you attach the whole system to your drone.Run the following code to check if the servo is functional.Step 5: Putting it All TogetherMake sure you make all the connections as shown in Figure 4.You\u2019ll integrate the sensors without using SoftwareSerial library.Employing hardware serial ports of your Arduino will minimize serial interference between libraries; hence, eliminating the servo vibration.Figure 4Open the Arduino window and paste the following code.In the code, set the desired GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude) where you need to drop off the basket.Once the desired location is added, click Upload.Again, don\u2019t forget to remove the TX pin of GPS from pin 0 before uploading the code.Upload the code on your Arduino and click the Serial Monitor icon in the top right corner.You\u2019ll see the current GPS coordinates of your drone.Let your drone fly to the desired location.When your drone reaches the desired address, bring it closer to the ground.The ultrasonic sensor will calculate the ground clearance.When it\u2019s about 15 cm, the servo releases the payload.The serial monitor prompts you when the package is delivered, and records the time as well.After dropping the payload, fly your drone back to its initial point.Precaution DO NOT put more than 2 kg load in the basket otherwise it will damage the assembly.Also be sure to check the spec of your drone so you will know how much weight that drone can handle.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Transportation Deliver <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Payload <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation deliver <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact package <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transporter your <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone/quadcopter <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination address <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation fly <extra_id_0> Transporter your <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination desired location <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation fly <extra_id_0> Transporter your <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination initial point <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble mounted <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler you <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components DIY payload delivery drone system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact drone/quadcopter <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble build <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler you <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact DIY payload delivery drone system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection measure <extra_id_0> Instrument ultrasonic sensor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle release <extra_id_0> Components payload <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument servo motor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place desired location <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble integrate <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler You <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components servo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact ultrasonic sensors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble affix <extra_id_0> Components Arduino <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact breadboard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble attach <extra_id_0> Components HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact breadboard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Connecting <extra_id_0> Components GPS Module <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble insert <extra_id_0> Components pins <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact breadboard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Connecting <extra_id_0> Components Bottle Cap <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Connecting <extra_id_0> Components Servo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Connect <extra_id_0> Components Servo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact Arduino <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection calculate <extra_id_0> Instrument ultrasonic sensor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation reaches <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination desired address, <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection find <extra_id_0> Instrument GPS <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble attach <extra_id_0> Components whole system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle remove <extra_id_0> Components GPS module <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble connect <extra_id_0> Components GPS <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Attach <extra_id_0> Components cap <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble integrate <extra_id_0> Components sensors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle releases <extra_id_0> Components payload <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact servo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Investigators: NY Bombing Suspect Bought Parts on eBayFederal investigators say the suspect in Saturday's bombings in New York and New Jersey bought components on eBay and used as triggering devices cell phones purchased from a store 500 meters from an address he once listed as his home.The details are contained in criminal complaints made public Tuesday spelling out multiple federal charges against 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami. Most of the charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.Authorities arrested Rahami on Monday after an exchange of gunfire with police that left him and two officers wounded.According to the court documents, investigators believe Rahami used an eBay account with the username \"ahmad rahami\" to buy citric acid, a circuit board, electric igniters and hundreds of ball bearings between June 20 and August 10. The items were shipped to a business in Perth Amboy, New Jersey where Rahami worked until September 12.Ball bearings were found in two pressure cooker bombs placed four blocks apart in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York late Saturday. One of them exploded, injuring 29 people, while the other was recovered intact. Investigators said the second bomb had \"numerous\" electric igniters.Ahmad Khan Rahami is taken into custody after a shootout with police Monday, Sept. 19, 2016.That second device was tested for fingerprints, and the criminal complaint said all 12 prints found were matches for Rahami. The documents say his prints were also found on items inside of a backpack that was discovered late Sunday at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, just outside of New York. The bag contained multiple explosive devices, including one that blew up as police tried to disarm it with a robot.Authorities also tied Rahami to a bomb that blew up in a trash can in Seaside Park, New Jersey early Saturday.That link involved one of the cell phones that investigators said were shipped last year to a store in Perth Amboy near the address that Rahami provided as his home in a 2012 passport application. They said a second phone shipped to the same place was used in the bomb that blew up in Chelsea.A third phone, one found with the other Chelsea bomb, was once registered to one of Rahami's family members, the documents said.Investigators also said they used surveillance video to tie Rahami to the Chelsea bombs, with cameras putting him near the explosion site about 37 minutes before the blast and near where the other bomb was found two minutes after the first one went off. That second video, they said, showed him pulling a suitcase and then a short time later walking without it.The documents contain some pieces of writing from a journal found on Rahami when he was arrested. The messages include praise of American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011, and \"Brother Osama Bin Laden,\" the former head of al-Qaida who was killed by U.S. forces in Pakistan in 2011.\"Inshallah the sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets. Gun shots to your police. Death To Your OPPRESSION,\" one message reads.The FBI said Tuesday it assessed Rahami's activities in 2014 after his father told agents he was concerned about his son's possible involvement with extremists.The agency found insufficient evidence to warrant further investigation.Rahami was born in Afghanistan, came to the U.S. at age 7 and became a naturalized American citizen.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell bought <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity components <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell purchased <extra_id_0> Giver store <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity cell phones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime criminal  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentence  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer Authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell buy <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity circuit board <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation shipped <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact items <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination New Jersey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice them <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle recovered <extra_id_0> Artifact other <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain custody <extra_id_0> Detainee Ahmad Khan Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew up <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew up <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Seaside Park <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew up <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Chelsea <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack went off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Anwar al-Awlaki <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator agency <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle disarm <extra_id_0> Artifact it <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "SANTIAGO, CHILE - A former top Venezuelan security official says video reports from Sunday's drone attack on President Nicolas Maduro demonstrate serious shortcomings in the response of the bodyguards protecting the increasingly embattled leader.\"Maduro's security was shown to be deficient,\" said retired Venezuelan Vice Admiral Mario Carratu, who has headed security teams for previous Venezuelan presidents, in a telephone interview with VOA. \"His bodyguards were slow to react and seemed to lack an evacuation plan for the president.\"Carratu said video of the incident, in which two drones exploded near a reviewing stand without injuring Maduro, suggested the president's security detail did not have an effective evacuation plan in place.The former admiral's analysis dovetails with public comments from disaffected former Venezuelan military officers who have gone public with claims to have been responsible for the assassination attempt.\"We showed that the regime is vulnerable. We didn't make it, but it's a matter of time before we do,\" said Salvatore Lucchese, a former Caracas police chief now in exile.Venezuelan opposition activist Salvatore Lucchese Venezuelan opposition activist Salvatore Lucchese speaks during an interview with Reuters in Bogota, Colombia Aug. 6, 2018. Venezuelan opposition activist Salvatore Lucchese speaks during an interview with Reuters in Bogota, Colombia Aug. 6, 2018.Lucchese claimed to have been part of the plot in an interview with Reuters this week in which he called for an armed overthrow of Maduro's leftist regime.Maduro was addressing a ceremony of the paramilitary National Guard in central Caracas when he came under attack from two drones packed with explosives. The government claims that one of the drones was diverted electronically while the second crashed into a nearby apartment building.Carratu confirmed that Venezuela, a longtime ally of Cuba, has the technology to electronically penetrate and interfere with the electronic signals of aircraft. But he ridiculed claims made on Twitter by persons saying they were involved in the attack that the drones had been shot down with firearms.\"Plastic explosives can't be detonated with bullets. They more likely exploded prematurely due to poor preparations by the hit team,\" he said.Lucchese's claim of responsibility for the attack came Wednesday but could not be independently confirmed. Responsibility has been claimed by a confusing array of spokesmen purporting to represent former and active members of Venezuela's security services, going by various names including \"The Resistance,\" \"Fenix Group\" and \"Soldiers in T Shirts.\"Lucchese was jailed by the Venezuelan government in 2014 for refusing orders to suppress opposition protests in his city. He took up political activity upon his release in 2016, when he objected to political negotiations with Maduro, but fled the country shortly afterward to avoid being arrested again.He did not reveal his location in the Reuters interview, but members of the Venezuelan government assert that he is in neighboring Colombia, a country that Maduro accuses of backing attempts to topple him.Exiled Venezuelan opposition journalist Patricia Poleo, long known for her close connections with the military, broadcast a statement from Miami that she claimed had been issued by officers in Venezuela. It said the officers were resorting to \"armed struggle\" because \"the regime has consistently ignored the constitution.\"Some opposition leaders have cast doubts on the claims of responsibility, suggesting instead that the attack was staged by the government to justify further repression.Julio Borges, president of the Venezuelan parliame Julio Borges, president of the Venezuelan parliament, arrives for a meeting with Ernesto Macias, president of Colombia's Senate, at the Congress in Bogota, Colombia, Aug. 8, 2018. Julio Borges, president of the Venezuelan parliament, arrives for a meeting with Ernesto Macias, president of Colombia's Senate, at the Congress in Bogota, Colombia, Aug. 8, 2018.The Maduro government this week has rounded up a half dozen military officers it accused of conducting the attacks and has issued arrest warrants for at least two opposition leaders, including congressional Speaker Julio Borges, who is in Colombia.Lucchese's police background crisscrossed with that of police lnspector Oscar Perez,who last year attacked Venezuela's Supreme Court from a helicopter with hand grenades and machine-gun fire. The attack came as the court's seven judges assumed the powers of parliament to allow Maduro to rule autocratically.Perez also machine-gunned a building housing Maduro's new handpicked national assembly, which had just ousted Attorney General Luisa Ortega for accusing Maduro of corruption and authoritarian rule.The Caracas metropolitan police, which has been largely dissolved by the Maduro government, maintained close links with opposition leaders. Lucchese was a member of the same Christian democratic First Justice party as Caracas Mayor Leopoldo Lopez, one of the most charismatic anti- government leaders who has been repeatedly imprisoned by Maduro.Perez was a subordinate to Lucchese in the police criminal investigations unit and the special operations brigade. He was killed by the new national secret police, SEBIN, whose forces used rocket-propelled grenades against his safe house when they raided it some months ago.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Crash crashed <extra_id_0> Vehicle second <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place apartment building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> CrashObject apartment building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target Nicolas Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> Target Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact broadcast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer SEBIN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> Instrument explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee opposition leaders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacked  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact meeting <extra_id_0> Participant Ernesto Macias <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact meeting <extra_id_0> Participant Ernesto Macias <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

ReutersMeanwhile, Venezuelans appeared to be abstaining in massive numbers on Sunday in a show of silent protest against a vote to select a constitutional assembly giving the government virtually unlimited powers.Associated Press journalists toured more than two dozen polling places in neighborhoods across the capital, including many traditional strongholds of the ruling socialist party in southern and western Caracas. Virtually all the polling places saw hours-long lines of thousands of people in past elections over the last two decades of socialist government.One site, a sports and cultural complex known as the Poliedro, had several thousand people waiting about two hours to vote, many having traveled from opposition-dominated neighborhoods where polling places were closed. Of the dozens of others sites seen by the AP, two in the loyalist-heavy neighborhood of El Valle had lines of approximately 200 to 400 people. All the others had at most a couple of dozen voters, and many had less than a half-dozen or were completely empty.Opinion polls say more than 70 percent of the country is opposed to Sunday's vote.\"People aren't in agreement with this,\" said Daniel Ponza, a 33-year-old drywall contractor, as he watched a few dozen people outside a polling place in El Valle. \"People are dying of hunger, looking for food in the trash.

Following an opposition-mandated special commission investigation into the matter, the socialist-majority Supreme Court issued a ruling last October that stated that Maduro had been born in Caracas in 1962, but did not produce a birth certificate.Some opposition leaders continue to sustain that they have proof that Maduro was born a Colombian national, which would make him constitutionally ineligible to occupy the presidency.Maduro's highly vocal critic and former president of Colombia ridiculed Maduro in a tweet that reads: \"My fellow countryman, didn't they let you vote?\"Paisano \u00bf No te dejaron votar? https://t.co/ouVWI4eMtS \u2014 Andr\u00e9s Pastrana A (@AndresPastrana_) July 30, 2017Despite that hiccup, the opposition is boycotting Sunday's vote, contending the election has been structured to ensure Maduro's socialist party continues to dominate. So all 5,500 candidates for the 545 seats in the constituent assembly are his supporters and the vote's success is being measured by turnout.The government is encouraging participation with tactics that include offering social benefits like subsidized food to the poor and threatening state workers' jobs if they don't vote.\"I'm here because I'm hoping for housing,\" said Luisa Marquez, a 46-year-old hairdresser.Others said they were there out of conviction that the constitutional assembly would help the government fend off what they called an international capitalist conspiracy to undermine Venezuela's socialist system with the help of the domestic opposition.\"The crisis, the shortages of food and medicine, that isn't the government's fault,\" said Luis Osuna, a 42-year-old private bodyguard. \"Those who are attacking us to kill us with hunger and blame the government are the same enemies the government's always had.\"Women shout slogans during a protest held by Venezuelans in Spain against Venezuela's Constituent Assembly election, in Madrid, Spain, on July 30, 2017.

Inflation and homicide rates are among the world's highest and widespread shortages of food and medicine have citizens dying of preventable illnesses and rooting through trash to feed themselves.The special assembly being selected Sunday will have powers to rewrite the country's 1999 constitution but will also have powers above and beyond other state institutions, including the opposition-controlled congress.While opinion polls say a vast majority oppose him, Maduro made clear in a televised address Saturday evening that he intends to use the assembly to govern without limitation, describing the vote as \"the election of a power that's above and beyond every other.\"He said he wants the assembly to strip opposition legislators of their constitutional immunity from prosecution and indicated he eager to prosecute many more members of the opposition parties that control a handful of state governments along with the National Assembly, providing one of the few remaining checks on the power of the socialist party that has ruled this OPEC nation for nearly two decades.\"The right wing already has its prison cell waiting,\" the president said. \"All the criminals will go to prison for the crimes they've committed.\"Saying the assembly will begin to govern within a week, Maduro said its first task in rewriting the constitution will be \"a total transformation\" of the office of Venezuela's chief prosecutor, a former government loyalist who has become the highest-ranking official to publicly split from the president.The Trump administration has imposed successive rounds of sanctions on high-ranking members of Maduro's administration, with the support of countries including Mexico, Colombia and Panama. Vice President Mike Pence promised on Friday that the U.S. would take \"strong and swift economic actions\" if the vote went ahead. He didn't say whether the U.S. would sanction Venezuelan oil imports, a measure with the potential to undermine Maduro but cause an even deeper humanitarian crisis here.Maduro's supporters on the Supreme Court set off the protests and clashes between police and demonstrator when they tried to strip the National Assembly of its powers in April.

President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was attending a ceremony to celebrate the 81st anniversary of the National Guard in Caracas on August 4, 2018.Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro survived an alleged assassination attempt via drone on Saturday when a flying device carrying explosives detonated during a speech he was delivering in Caracas.Maduro, an unpopular leader who has presided over one of the worst economic collapses in Latin America in recent history, blamed the \"far right,\" including Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, for the attack.Here\u2019s what happened: On Saturday evening, Maduro was addressing the crowd at a military parade celebrating the 81st anniversary of the National Guard when a flying device approached and exploded, according to Venezuelan officials.Footage of the event, which was broadcast on live television, shows Maduro look up mid-speech, while his wife Cilia Flores, who is standing behind him, flinches.For a few seconds, no one appears to react, as they seem to be processing what\u2019s happened.\"Seconds later, there was a second explosion,\" Maduro said in a national address recounting the incident.Then the crowd disperses and people flee.Some

health.\"\"This was an attempt to kill me,\" Maduro later said in a retelling of what happened.\"Today they attempted to assassinate me.\"Firefighters at the scene disputed that account, however, telling the Associated Press that a gas tank had exploded nearby.Maduro, 55, said he believed the attempted attack was part of a right-wing plot against him that was working with opponents in Bogot\u00e1 and Miami, including Santos, the outgoing Colombian president.He provided no evidence to back up his accusations.The Colombian government called Maduro\u2019s charges \"absurd.\"Other countries expressed support for Maduro after the attack, including Turkey, Syria, Nicaragua, and Russia.Bolivian President Evo Morales in a series of tweets expressed solidarity with Maduro and described the attempt as a \"crime against humanity.\"A little-known group called Soldiers in T-Shirts claimed responsibility for the act, saying they planned to fly two drones at the president but the devices were shot down.The AP couldn\u2019t verify the claims, and the group didn\u2019t respond to a message from the outlet when it reached out for comment.National Security Adviser John Bolton said in an appearance onFox News Sundaythat the United States had \"no involvement\" in the incident.\"If the government of Venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of US criminal law, we\u2019ll take a serious look at it, but in the meantime I think what we really should focus on is the corruption and oppression in the Maduro regime in Venezuela,\" he said.The political situation in Venezuela is badMaduro, a former bus driver who took over as president after former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez died in 2013, has overseen a catastrophic economic collapse in Venezuela.The socialist economy, once thriving, has spiraled since global oil prices dropped in 2014.Venezuelans suffer from widespread food and medicine shortages, and the majority of the country is living in poverty.Seventy-five percent of the country\u2019s population lost an average of 19 pounds of bodyweight between 2015 and 2016, and the International Monetary Fund expects inflation in Venezuela to reach 13,000 percent in 2018.Thousands of Venezuelans are fleeing the country.Yet Maduro remains in power.He won reelection in May due to a largely rigged election.He banned two of the most popular opposition leaders, Leopoldo Lopez and Henrique Capriles, from running against him, and implied that any Venezuelans who didn\u2019t vote for him could lose government food subsidies.His election is likely to worsen the economic crisis in Venezuela: Instead of electing a reformer who might enact the measures necessary to pull the country out of the state it\u2019s in right now, such as addressing its currency exchange policy and diversifying the economy away from oil dependence, the country now has Maduro for another six years.And he remains defiant \u2014 in the face of opposition, or alleged assassination attempts.Update: Story updated with comments from John Bolton.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument drone

{"text": "Venezuela crisis: Maduro to raise fuel prices to combat smugglingVenezuela\u2019s heavily subsidised domestic fuel prices should rise to international levels to avoid billions of dollars in annual losses as a result of smuggling, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has said in a televised address.\"Gasoline must be sold at an international price to stop smuggling to Colombia and the Caribbean,\" the president said.Like most oil-producing countries, Venezuela has for decades subsidised fuel as a benefit to consumers.But its fuel prices have remained nearly flat for years despite hyperinflation that the International Monetary Fund has projected would reach 1 million per cent this year.That means that for the price of a cup of coffee, a driver can fill the tank of a small SUV nearly 9,000 times.Recently, the average price of a coffee with milk was 2.2m bolivars, or about 50 cents, local media has reported.Smugglers do brisk business reselling fuel in neighbouring countries.Quick guideWhy is Venezuela in crisis?Show Hide Under the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who ushered in Venezuela\u2019s socialist revolution in 1999, a new constitution and numerous elections placed nearly all government institutions under the control of the ruling Socialist party.This concentration of power was aided by a feuding opposition which carried out ineffectual campaigns and electoral boycotts.After Ch\u00e1vez died of cancer in 2013, he was succeeded by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro who is even less tolerant of dissent.Growing political authoritarianism has coincided with greater state dominance over the economy.But expropriations, price controls and mismanagement have led to a 40% contraction of the economy in the past five years.Oil accounts for 96% of Venezuela\u2019s export income but many foreign companies have been driven out and production has dropped to a 30-year low.The resulting fiscal crisis has prompted the government to print more money, which has led to hyperinflation and a collapse of the currency.It also means that the government can\u2019t import enough food and medicine to meet demand.Maduro has rejected economic reforms out of loyalty to socialism and because many government officials are allegedly getting rich off the economic distortions \u2013 through exchange rate scams and by selling scarce food on the black market.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Maduro said the government would still provide direct subsidies to citizens holding the \"fatherland card\", a state-issued identification card that the government uses to provide bonuses and track use of social services.He said the subsidy was only available to those who registered their cars in a vehicle census being conducted by the state.Venezuela has dirt-cheap fuel, so why is driving nearly impossible?Read moreOn Friday, the UN said that more than half a million Venezuelans had crossed into Ecuador this year as part of one of the largest mass migrations in Latin American history.About 547,000 citizens have entered Ecuador since January \u2013 mostly through its northern border with Colombia \u2013 to escape rampant crime and political violence, a collapsing economy and severe shortages of food and medicines.More than 1 million Venezuelans have also crossed into Colombia since the exodus began in 2015.Others have fanned out across

{"text": "(CNN) A federal appeals court ruled on Friday to vacate the death sentence of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , who along with his brother planted homemade bombs near the finish of the 2013 Boston Marathon, killing three spectators and injuring hundreds.The court also ruled to set aside three of his 30 convictions but said he will remain in federal prison for the rest of his life.The court ruled Tsarnaev should be given a new penalty phase trial, where a new set of jurors can again decide if he should be sentenced to death.Tsarnaev, now 27, will remain incarcerated and is being held at the nation's most secure federal prison in Florence, Colorado.\"And just to be crystal clear: Because we are affirming the convictions (excluding the three ... convictions) and the many life sentences imposed on those remaining counts (which Dzhokhar has not challenged), Dzhokhar will remain confined to prison for the rest of his life, with the only question remaining being whether the government will end his life by executing him,\" the opinion, authored by Circuit Court Judge Ojetta Rogeriee Thompson, says.Tsarnaev was convicted in 2015, including for the deaths of Krystle Campbell Lingzi Lu at the marathon and police officer Sean Collier, separately.Around-the-clock coverageTsarnaev's legal team had pushed to change the venue of the trial to a courthouse that wasn't so close to the site of the bombing, in the heart of a town so affected by the tragedy.The appeals court judges agreed, saying, \"One could not turn on the radio either without hearing something about these stunningly sad events.\"The appeals judges ruled that US District Court Judge George O'Toole, who oversaw Tsarnaev's trial, \"fell short\" of his promise to question jurors thoroughly enough to identify the degree to which they had been exposed to facts of the case through media coverage, \"providing sufficient ground to vacate his death sentences.\"Part of the appeals court's ruling was a decision to reverse three convictions for charges that Tsarnaev was carrying a firearm in connection with his possession of a pressure cooker bomb.The ruling tells the district court to enter judgments of acquittal on those charges, put together a new jury and preside over a new trial that strictly focuses on what penalty Tsarnaev should receive for the counts that are eligible for the death penalty.Tsarnaev's attorneys had filed a post-trial motion for judgments of acquittal on these convictions that the district court judge denied.CNN has reached out to Tsarnaev's legal team for comment on the ruling.The ruling also states that the judges make no judgment about whether Boston is a \"proper venue\" for a sentencing retrial, and says it is a decision that should be left to the US District Court for Massachusetts, where the initial trial was held.The US Attorney's office said: \"We are currently reviewing the opinion and are declining further comment at this time.\"Tsarnaev was 19 years old when he and his brother, Tamerlan, who was 26 years old at the time, went to Boston's Boylston Street shortly before 3 p.m. on April 15, 2013, to carry out their plotSurveillance video showed the brothers carrying the pressure cooker bombs in backpacks and moving through the crowd near the marathon finish line in what federal prosecutors called a coordinated attack.Tamerlan set off the first bomb, a 6-quart pressure cooker that contained gunpowder, nails and BBs, prosecutors said.The bomb killed Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager, and permanently injured several other people who lost their legs.The second pressure cooker bomb, carried in by Dzhokhar, went off 12 seconds later and killed two people, Martin and Lu, a graduate student from China.The bombings sparked a manhunt for days that shut down the city and resulted in wall-to-wall coverage of the search.The brothers, while on the run, killed Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier.After they stole an SUV, the two were chased by police.Tamerlan died in an explosive firefight with police in nearby Watertown.Dzhokhar was arrested a day later.Victims, families to relive another trialThe decision to order a new trial will be difficult for the families of victims, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said after the decision came down on Friday.\"I think the concern that some families have had from the very beginning was that this day was going to come, where they would have to relive another trial, and you know they shouldn't have to relive another trial,\" Walsh said.\"The only thing that I'll say is a positive ... this guy will never see the light of day again.He's going to live within those four walls.He got exactly what he deserved.\"Shortly after Tsarnaev was found guilty on all counts, the parents of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was killed in the bombing, publicly pleaded for prosecutors not to pursue the death sentence in the penalty phase of the trial.\"We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring,\" the parents wrote in a column in The Boston Globe.\"As long as the defendant is in the spotlight, we have no choice but to live a story told on his terms, not ours.The minute the defendant fades from our newspapers and TV screens is the minute we begin the process of rebuilding our lives and our family.\"CNN has reached out to the Richard family for comment on Friday's ruling.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentence

{"text": "How Many US Troops Were Killed By Iranian IEDs in Iraq?Far fewer than Congress thinks, according to newly declassified documents from U.S. Central Command.Explosively formed penetrators \u2014 a particularly deadly form of roadside bomb \u2014 killed 196 American soldiers in Iraq over a five-and-a-half-year period, according to recently declassified Pentagon documents.That\u2019s about half as many deaths as lawmakers have attributed to the bombs, which U.S. officials say were largely supplied by Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force.The carnage wrought by EFPs returned to the news over the summer, as opponents of the nuclear deal with Iran cited Tehran\u2019s behind-the-scenes actions against U.S. troops during Operation Iraqi Freedom as a reason to scuttle the agreement.Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who is also running for president, and others in Congress have said that EFPs had killed more than 500 troops.\u201cI understand that the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency has a classified list of roughly 500 American soldiers who were murdered by Iranian IEDs,\u201d Cruz said at a July 29 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.But data from U.S. Central Command, which runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East, suggests the actual toll is far less.According to the first comprehensive accounting, between November 2005 and December 2011, 1,526 EFPs killed a total of 196 U.S. troops and injured 861.Between October 2006 and September 2007, EFPs killed 97 U.S. troops and wounded more than 300 soldiers.EFP attacks peaked in March, April and May 2008, near the end of the American troop surge, when 200 of the bombs were detonated.The deadliest month was April 2008, when EFPs killed 15 U.S. soldiers.The Pentagon attributes the presence of EFPs in Iraq to the Quds Force, the special forces arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard led by Qasem Soleimani.Various EFP \u201cfactories\u201d were found throughout Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.Still, the exact degree to which Iran bears culpability for arming Shia militias in Iraq with EFPs and related equipment is a matter of some dispute.\u201cWe weren\u2019t always able to attribute the casualties that we had to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we didn't necessarily have the forensics to support that,\u201d Gen. Joseph Dunford, the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at his July 9 confirmation hearing.During the hearing, Dunford said the numbers of American soldiers killed by Iran \u201chas been recently quoted as about 500.\u201dCENTCOM later clarified that Dunford was referring to total American deaths by EFPs and other Iranian weapons.It is \u201cimportant to understand that the CENTCOM statistics on EFP detonations are a subset of all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during OIF,\u201d Maj. Genieve David, a CENTCOM spokeswoman, said in an email.Data about the roughly 300 deaths not caused by EFPs, including the kind of weapons used in the attacks, is classified, David said.A few weeks later, at the July 29 hearing, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the outgoing Joint Chiefs chairman, said \u201cseveral hundred\u201d American forces were killed by EFPs.Phil Novack, a spokesman for Cruz, told Defense One that the Senator's office is working with the Pentagon to get specific numbers.He said Cruz used the 500 number based on Dunford's testimony.Cruz \u201casked Secretary Carter to inform the families of the 500 service members who were killed by Iranian EFPs that their loved ones were murdered by the same man who will now receive sanctions relief,\u201d Novack said in an email.\u201cWhether the number is 500 lives or 196 is immaterial; the fact remains that General Soleimani \u2014 a man responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American service members \u2014 will receive sanctions relief to the tune of millions of dollars if this deal is approved.\"The arrival of EFPs on the Iraqi battlefield around 2005 came as a shock to U.S. planners.Along with more run-of-the-mill improvised explosive devices, the deadly bombs drove a crash effort to create and deploy vehicles with far better armor.Whereas most roadside bombs send energy and shrapnel in all directions, EFPs work more like cannons.The force of the blast molds a concave metal disc, called a liner, into a \u201cformed penetrator\u201d which is propelled at up to 3,000 meters per second.The effect is incredibly destructive, even to up-armored Humvees.\u201cYou can do as much or more damage with a 5-pound EFP, which is aimed, as with a 200-pound conventional IED,\u201d a Pentagon analyst told Los Angeles Times writer Andrew Cockburn in 2007.The analyst speculated that the cost to construct such a device was about $30 or less.They\u2019ve been around since at least World War II, when resistance elements in Europe used them against Germans, Cockburn wrote.Among the other Iranian arms introduced to the Iraqi battlefield is the improvised rocket assisted munition, described in one Joint IED Defeat Organization document as \u201ca rocket-fired improvised explosive device made from a large metal canister \u2014 such as a propane gas tank \u2014 filled with explosives, scrap metal and ball bearings and propelled by rockets.\u201dFirst seen in Iraq in 2007, the IRAM \u2014 \u201cessentially an airborne version of a roadside bomb \u2014 a flying IED\u201d is \u201dthe signature weapon used by Iranian-backed militias that operate with the aid of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Group,\u201d the undated document says.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die Killed <extra_id_0> Victim Troops

{"text": "On 4 December 1971, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group, detonated a bomb at McGurk's Bar in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The pub was frequented by Irish Catholics/nationalists. The explosion caused the building to collapse, killing fifteen Catholic civilians\u2014including two children\u2014and wounding seventeen more. It was the deadliest attack in Belfast during the Troubles.Despite evidence to the contrary, the British security forces asserted that a bomb had exploded prematurely while being handled by Irish Republican Army (IRA) members inside the pub, implying that the victims themselves were partly to blame. A report later found that the police (Royal Ulster Constabulary) were biased in favour of this view, and that this hindered their investigation. The victims' relatives allege that the security forces deliberately spread disinformation to discredit the IRA. In 1977, UVF member Robert Campbell was sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in the bombing and served fifteen years.The bombing sparked a series of tit-for-tat bombings and shootings by loyalists and republicans, which contributed to making 1972 the bloodiest year of the conflict.==Background==McGurk's (also called the Tramore Bar) was a two-storey public house on the corner of North Queen Street and Great George's Street, in the New Lodge area to the north of Belfast city centre. This was a mainly Irish nationalist and Catholic neighbourhood, and the pub's regular customers were from the community. The pub was owned by Patrick and Philomena McGurk, who lived on the upper floor with their four children.The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) was formed in Belfast in 1966, declaring \"war\" on the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Until 1971, however, its actions were few and it \"scarcely existed in an organisational sense\". The British Army was deployed in Northern Ireland following the August 1969 riots, which are usually seen as the start of the Troubles. In December 1969 the IRA split into two factions: the 'Official' IRA and Provisional IRA. Both launched armed campaigns against the British Army, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the government of Northern Ireland.During 1971, the violence gradually worsened. There were daily bombings and shootings by republicans, loyalists and the security forces. During the first two weeks of December, there were about 70 bombings and about 30 people were killed. On 2 December, three republican prisoners escaped from Crumlin Road prison, not far from McGurk's. Security was tightened and there was a heavy RUC and British Army presence in the area over the next two days. Eyewitnesses asserted that the checkpoints around McGurk's were removed just an hour before the attack.==Bombing==On the evening of Saturday 4 December 1971, a four-man UVF team met in the Shankill area of Belfast and were ordered to bomb a pub on North Queen Street. According to the only convicted bomber\u2014Robert Campbell\u2014they were told not to return until the job was done. Campbell said that their target had not been McGurk's, but another pub nearby. It is believed this was a pub called The Gem, which was allegedly linked to the Official IRA. The  bomb was disguised as a brown parcel, which they placed in a car and drove to their target. Campbell says they stopped near The Gem at about 7:30pm, but could not gain access to it because there were security guards outside. After waiting for almost an hour, they drove a short distance to McGurk's. At about 8:45pm, one of them placed the bomb in the porch entrance on Great George's Street and rushed back to the car. It exploded just moments after they drove off. Campbell implied that McGurk's had been chosen only because it was \"the nearest Catholic pub\".The blast caused the building to collapse. Bystanders immediately rushed to free the dead and wounded from the rubble. Firefighters, paramedics, police and soldiers were quickly on the scene. Fifteen Catholic civilians had been killed\u2014including two children\u2014and a further seventeen wounded. The rescue effort lasted many hours.Within two hours of the blast, a sectarian clash had erupted nearby at the New Lodge\u2013Tiger's Bay interface. The British Army and RUC moved in and a gun battle developed. A British Army officer, Major Jeremy Snow, was shot by the IRA on New Lodge Road and died of his wounds on 8 December. Two RUC officers and five civilians were also wounded by gunfire. Eventually, five companies of troops were sent into the district and they searched almost 50 houses.Meanwhile, the UVF team had driven to a nearby pickup point where they dumped their car. They walked to the area of St Anne's Cathedral and were picked up by another. They were driven back to the Shankill and met the man who had ordered the attack in an Orange Hall, telling him that \"the job has been done\".Among those killed were Philomena and Maria McGurk, wife and 14-year-old daughter of the pub owner Patrick McGurk. Patrick and his three sons were seriously injured. Shortly after the attack, McGurk appeared on television calling for no retaliation: \"It doesn't matter who planted the bomb. What's done can't be undone. I've been trying to keep bitterness out of it.\"==Investigation=====Responsibility===After the bombing, the media reported various theories about who was responsible. The main theories were:*that it had been planted by loyalists;*that it had exploded prematurely while being prepared by IRA members inside the pub;*that it had exploded prematurely while \"in transit\", an IRA member having left it in the pub to be collected by another IRA member; and*that it had been planted as part of a feud between the Provisional IRA and Official IRA.The security forces promoted the idea that it was an IRA bomb which exploded prematurely (an \"own goal\"). Survivors and relatives denied this. They said the pub was not associated with the IRA and there had been no suspicious people or activity in the pub that night. An Intelligence Corps document from December 1971 also said that the pub was not known to have IRA associations. On 6 December, both wings of the IRA condemned the attack, denied responsibility and blamed the UVF and security forces.====Claims of responsibility====That same day, several newspapers received telephone calls from someone claiming to be a spokesman for the \"Empire Loyalists\". Their statement to the Belfast Telegraph was:We [the Empire Loyalists] accept responsibility for the destruction of McGurk's pub. We placed 30lb of new explosives outside the pub because we had proved beyond doubt that meetings of IRA Provisionals and Officials were held there. The \"Empire Loyalists\" had made only one other claim of responsibility; for bombing a community centre on 12 November. The RUC, however, had no intelligence about such a group; suggesting that it may have been a covername.On Tuesday 7 December, a youth claimed to have seen a man acting oddly at a phone kiosk the night before. He said the man was wearing a jacket with a UVF badge on it. The youth claimed to have checked the kiosk after the man left and found a torn bit of paper. When put together, it included the lines:We the Empire Loyalists wish to state that we did not destroy McGurk's public house as an act of retaliation ... Furthermore we do not require the forensic experts of the Army to cover up for us ... We shall not issue any further statements until we exterminate another rebel stronghold.In the days following the bombing, the RUC received a letter signed by \"Chief of Staff, UVF\" claiming that the UVF bombed the pub because an IRA meeting was due to take place there. It said that two UVF members entered the pub, had a drink and asked the barman to mind a package while they \"ran an errand\". Witnesses told the RUC, however, that there had been no strangers in the pub and that nobody had left a package. Three other unsigned letters were sent to the RUC, claiming it was an IRA bomb \"in transit\" and that two IRA members were killed.====Location of the bomb====For the RUC, the location of the bomb (whether it exploded inside or outside) became the key to finding who was responsible. However, investigators (both RUC and British Army) were unsure and gave conflicting opinions.RUC duty officers' reports were made daily. Their purpose was to brief the Chief Constable and others at HQ about events that had happened that day. The reports were also made available to the British Army's General Officer Commanding for Northern Ireland. The 4\u20135 December 1971 report said of the bombing: \"Just before the explosion a man entered the licensed premises and left down a suitcase, presumably to be picked up by a known member of the IRA. The bomb was intended for use on other premises. Before the 'pick-up' was made the bomb exploded\". The origin of this information could not be established.On 6 December, however, the RUC took a witness statement from an 8-year-old boy. He said that a car had stopped outside the pub with four men inside and \"a wee Union Jack stuck in the back window\". He said one left a package in the Great George's Street doorway and ran back to the car, which sped off just moments before the package exploded. A man and a woman backed up his story, although they did not witness as much as the boy. Despite this, the security forces and the government stood behind the \"own goal\" theory. A British Intelligence Corps document covering the period 8\u201315 December said: \"It has been confirmed that it was a [Provisional IRA] bomb which was destined for another target, but exploded prematurely.\" A Ministry of Defence (MOD) document dated 14 December said that this \"should be publicised\". On 23 December, the British Army sent a letter (signed by a lieutenant colonel) to people living in north Belfast. It said that when the IRA in the area is destroyed, \"we can look forward to \u2026 a period in which you will not lose your friends in a repetition of the [IRA's] accident in the McGurk\u2019s bar.\"===Arrest and conviction of Robert Campbell===In March 1976, the RUC received intelligence that linked UVF member Robert Campbell and four others to the McGurk's bombing. Campbell was arrested on 27 July 1977 and held at Castlereagh RUC base. He was interviewed seven times during 27 and 28 July. He admitted his part in the bombing but refused to name the others. Campbell's story matches that given by the young boy witness.On 29 July 1977, Campbell was charged with the 15 murders and 17 attempted murders. On 6 September 1978 he pleaded guilty to all charges and received life imprisonment with \"a recommendation to serve no less than 20 years\", in part for a separate conviction for the murder of a Protestant delivery driver in 1976. He is the only person to have been charged for the bombing. He eventually served fifteen years in prison and was released on 9 September 1993.===Collusion claims and Police Ombudsman's investigation===The victims' relatives campaigned for an independent investigation of the bombing as they believed that the RUC's investigation was flawed from the outset. Moreover, they wished to disprove the claim that the victims were IRA members killed by their own bomb (the \"own goal\" theory). Even after Campbell's conviction, the \"own goal\" theory remained officially unchallenged. Relatives argued that this theory was promoted as part of a \"government policy to avoid publicly acknowledging the loyalist campaign of violence\". Another argument is that it was promoted to undermine the IRA's support and stir tension between the two IRA factions.Relatives also asked how the bombers were able to plant the bomb and flee despite the usually heavy security presence. Some alleged that the security forces helped the bombers by removing checkpoints. The 2009 book Killing For Britain, written by former UVF member 'John Black', claimed that the British undercover unit known as the Military Reaction Force or Military Reconnaissance Force (MRF) organized the bombing and helped the bombers get in and out of the area. The bombers' original target, The Gem, was associated with the Official IRA. It is claimed that the MRF ordered the team to bomb The Gem, with the intention of blaming it on the Provisional IRA. The plan was allegedly to start a feud between the two IRA factions, which would both divert them from their campaign against British forces and drain their support. However, as The Gem had security outside, they bombed the nearest 'Catholic pub'.On 21 February 2011, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland published a report about the bombing and the RUC's investigation of it. The report said that there is no evidence that the RUC helped the UVF bombers. However, it found that the RUC investigation was biased in favour of the view that the IRA was responsible. It failed to give enough thought to the possible involvement of loyalists, and this bias hindered the investigation. The report also found that RUC gave \"selective\" and \"misleading\" briefings to the government and media, which furthered the idea that it was an IRA bomb. The Ombudsman has not found an explanation why successive Chief Constables have not addressed this mistake. Ombudsman Al Hutchinson said: \"Inconsistent police briefings, some of which inferred that victims of the bombing were culpable in the atrocity, caused the bereaved families great distress, which has continued for many years\".On 6 December 2012, Scottish Labour MP Michael Connarty - whose uncle was killed in the bombing - claimed in Westminster that then-Prime Minister Edward Heath \"may have been involved\" in wrongfully blaming the IRA and spreading the story. Connarty also urged David Cameron, Prime Minister at the time, to apologise to victims and launch a full investigation.==Remembrance==In 2001 a memorial was unveiled on the site of McGurk's Bar to mark the 30th anniversary of the bombing. Relatives of the victims called for an investigation into allegations that British forces helped the bombers. Almost a thousand people attended a service at St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street, after which fifteen wreaths, one for each victim, were carried by relatives leading a silent candlelit procession to a new memorial at Great George's Street.Patrick McGurk died on 15 December 2007, having forgiven those responsible for the explosion and having prayed for the men who carried out the attack.==See

{"text": "(NaturalNews) The socialist \"revolution\" against democracy and free markets is proceeding in Venezuela, with the authoritarian government downplaying a mysterious disease outbreak as print media in the country slowly dies off.As reported by WPLG'sin Miami, there have been at least 10 deaths from the as-yet-unidentified disease. The deaths have occurred in several Venezuelan cities, including the capital of Caracas. As it spreads, the disease is creating panic among the population and has led some of the nation's physicians to sound the alarm.However, as WPLG reported, the warnings are being downplayed by the socialist government:However, though the government remains in denial mode, doctors in Venezuela are taking the threat seriously; they say there is genuine reason for concern, especially in a country where government policies have created nightmarish shortages of everything from basic food supplies to medicines. Plus, they say the disease is both dangerous and contagious.\"We do not know what it is,\" Duglas Leon Natera, president of the Venezuelan Medical Federation, said, according to WPLG.At first, those infected present with a fever and spots on the skin, which then produce large blisters followed by internal and external bleeding, says data provided by the College of Physicians in the state of Aragua, where the first cases were seen.From that point, the disease progresses very quickly; patients begin suffering from respiratory failure, then kidney failure. And thus far, Venezuelan doctors have not been able to figure out what they are dealing with, let alone a treatment plan.And the government is hindering the process, largely by denying that there even is \"a mysterious disease ,\" because that's what dictatorial, socialist leaders do: claim infallibility and blame others. One official called the doctors' information nothing but a \"media campaign against Venezuela .\"And the governor of the state of Aragua, Tarek El-Aissami, along with Communications Minister Delcy Rodriguez, has labeled the warnings a \"defamatory\" strategy to \"distress to the population.\"Doctors are not completely in the dark; some have speculated on what the disease might be. Theories include a new type of very aggressive, severe dengue fever and a different version of Chikungunya fever; some have even suggested that it could be Ebola.Meanwhile, as its people die, so, too, does Venezuela's ability to inform its people; the country's print media is slowing dying too, suffering from a lack of newsprint, as WPLG reported:According to a newly released report by the Institute for Press and Society of Venezuela, or IPYS, 34 newspapers and magazines in 11 states have reported in the past year chronic shortages and difficulties acquiring supplies and other materials to print, such as ink, film and plates.The situation has been made worse by the government's strict controls on acquiring foreign exchange, as well as interference in the internal processes of suppliers. An exchange rate control was enacted in the country 11 years ago; it required companies to apply for permits in order to purchase foreign currency and import goods. And newspaper owners have been saying it has been months since they were granted permits to buy newsprint.\"Due to the impossibility of securing newsprint and print materials, 10 print outlets have stopped circulating altogether and four others have halted circulation temporarily,\" WPLG reported. \"Others have reduced the number of pages per edition, sometimes by more than half, or stopped running during the weekend in order to survive.\"In fact, the report said, the oldest Venezuelan daily,, nearly shuttered recently.\"The newspaper industry is in a coma in Venezuela,\" the paper's president, Carlos Eduardo Carmona, said. \"The government is slowly killing the free press in Venezuela.\"As for the doctors who tried to warn the public? Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has ordered them prosecuted for \"a scheme of alarm, of psychological terrorism.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak outbreak <extra_id_0> Place Venezuela <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Disease disease <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact sound  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die die  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact inform  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

Every time someone tells this government the truth in connection with a disease, an economic problem or a security issue, that person automatically becomes a coup-plotter,\u201d said Douglas N\u00e1tera, president of the federation.Health Minister Nancy P\u00e9rez, who has held that portfolio for just a few days, made a public statement on Wednesday to address the growing social alarm.\u201cThe main thing is that there is no strange virus right now. The moment some disease crops up, the people of Venezuela will know about it, because it is not state policy to conceal information but rather to disclose it and to take the necessary measures.\u201dFor every patient diagnosed with Chikungunya, there could be as many as 1,000 moreYet the minister admitted to 45,745 confirmed cases of dengue fever and 398 more of the Chikungunya virus, which causes acute joint pains and is also spread by mosquitoes. Another 1,200 patients are under observation.But Rafael Arreaza, a surgeon and former director of Venezuela\u2019s Social Security service, questioned the minister\u2019s figures and filed a complaint against the government with the Ombudsman.Arreaza said that for every patient diagnosed with Chikungunya, there could be as many as 1,000 more, and that the lack of lab material is preventing health workers from knowing the true magnitude of the problem.This former health official also said that 12 of the victims who died were showing similar symptoms, suggesting the need to find out whether the virus is mutating.In the face of this mounting pressure, President Maduro said he will take national and international legal action against any physician but also against any journalist, media outlet or individual who contributes to disseminating this theory through words or images.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak disease <extra_id_0> Place Venezuela <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak Chikungunya <extra_id_0> Victim patient <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak Chikungunya <extra_id_0> Victim patient <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak virus <extra_id_0> Victim victims <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

in providing additional leads and images.The casualtiesThe blasts left three people dead.-- Martin Richard , an 8-year-old boy with a gap-tooth grin and bright eyes.He loved to run and play in his yard.-- Krystle Campbell , a 29-year-old freckle-faced woman described as having \"a heart of gold.\"-- The third victim was Lingzu Lu , a graduate student at Boston University, who had moved to the city last fall, making friends and soaking up new experiences.-- Of the approximately 178 people injured, 66 remain in area hospitals, according to the latest CNN tally.Thirteen of those are still in critical condition, hospital officials said.- Martin's mother and sister are among the wounded.His mother underwent surgery for a brain injury, and his 6-year-old sister lost her leg.The injuries-- Doctors say dozens of victims suffered injuries to their legs that involve blood vessels, bone and tissue.-- The bombings resulted in at least 13 amputations and left doctors picking ball bearings out of victims in the emergency room, a terrorism expert briefed on the investigation said.-- Dr. George Velmahos, head of trauma care at Massachusetts General Hospital, said his team found \"numerous\" metal pellets and nails inside patients' bodies.\"There are people who have 10, 20, 30, 40 of them in their body, or more,\" Velmahos said.-- Dr. Ron Walls also said one patient had more than 12 carpenter-type nails.\"There is no question some of these objects were implanted in the device for the purpose of being exploded forward,\" he said.Terror group links-- While the clues moved the investigation forward, it is still unclear whether the attack was an act of domestic or foreign terrorism.-- No connection has been made to any terrorist group or individual.-- President Barack Obama described the bombings as an act of terrorism, but said it is unclear whether they were the work of a group or \"a malevolent individual.\"-- The Pakistani Taliban has said it was not involved in the attack.-- Authorities don't have a sense of what the motive is, an official said.-- The FBI asked the public to report anyone who talked about targeting the marathon or showed interest in explosives.The agency urged anyone who might have heard explosions in remote areas -- possibly by someone testing a bomb -- or seen someone carrying \"an unusually heavy, dark-colored bag\" around the time of the attack to come forward.'Possible' suspectsThree days later, authorities have yet to make an arrest, but have made \"significant progress,\" a law enforcement official said.-- Investigators have pinpointed two men of \"high interest\" as possible suspects after they appeared in images near the finish line moments before the blasts, a law enforcement official said.-- One of the men is seen carrying a black backpack.-- Authorities had not yet named the two, but their photographs have been distributed to law enforcement, a source said.-- Earlier Wednesday, two sources with knowledge of the investigation identified a man as a possible suspect in the attack, but did not name him.-- Seen on a video, the man wore a white baseball cap.One of the sources added that the cap was on backwards and the man was also wearing a light-colored hooded sweatshirt and a black jacket.-- It was not immediately clear if he is one of those alluded to in the photographs distributed to law enforcement officials.-- Investigators are closer to cracking the case \"every hour,\" Massachusetts Gov.Deval Patrick said.He urged patience with the probe to allow investigators space to do their job.-- \"I wish they had nailed the perpetrator within minutes of this catastrophe, but I understand from experience it's going to take some time,\" he said.The Investigation-- Significant progress has been made in the investigation, but there has been no arrest, the FBI told CNN.-- After sources told CNN on Wednesday that an arrest had been made, sources with the Department of Justice and Boston Police Department each said that no arrest had been made.-- A source with Boston law enforcement said, \"We got him,\" but would not clarify whether that meant an identification had been made or an arrest carried out.-- Some federal sources said that it would be going too far to say even that an identification had been made, but several sources in Boston disputed that, saying a clear identification had been made.-- Investigators believe they have identified a suspect in the marathon bombings, a source who has been briefed on the investigation told CNN's John King.The possible breakthrough came from an analysis of video from a Lord and Taylor department store near the site of the second blast, and video from a Boston TV station helped as well, the official said.-- As they scramble to search for suspects, authorities are processing \"the most complex crime scene that we have dealt with in the history of our department,\" said Ed Davis, the Boston police commissioner.-- Forensic specialists and dogs trained to detect explosive devices and their residue were at the scene of the blasts.A command post has been created, with 1,000 officers conducting interviews and gathering details.-- Authorities have received 2,000 tips from around the world, said Richard DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office.\"Someone knows who did this,\" he said.Security elsewhere-- Cities have stepped up security after the attacks, including Washington, New York, Miami, Chicago, Atlanta and Los Angeles.-- British police said they are reviewing the security plan for the London Marathon scheduled for Sunday.The marathon will observe 30 seconds of silence and is urging runners to wear a black ribbon to mark the Boston tragedy.Reaction-- \"Boston is not going to be intimidated by this,\" said Secretary of State John Kerry, a former U.S. senator from Massachusetts.\"But we are going to find out who did this.The police work being done is extraordinary.The FBI is remarkable.There is a great deal of forensic evidence.We are hopeful we can bring people to justice.\"\"The Islamic Republic condemns killing of innocent people in U.S. Boston, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria in equal measure,\" Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Wednesday, according to a report on state-run Press TV.Tributes-- Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will travel to Boston on Thursday for an 11 a.m. interfaith service dedicated to the victims.The president is expected to meet with the families of those wounded or killed.--Obama declared an emergency in Massachusetts and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1>

{"text": "The 2019 Quetta bombing was a suicide bomb attack on an open marketplace in Quetta, Pakistan on 12 April, killing 21 people.The bombing took place near an area where many minority Shiite Muslims live.At least ten Hazara, including nine Shiites, were among the dead.Two paramilitary soldiers were also killed in the bombing.PM Imran Khan expressed condolences for the lives lost, directed the authorities to ensure the best medical treatment for the injured, and ordered an increase in security for Shiites and Hazara people.Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and ISIL later accepted responsibility for the attack, stating that \"their target were Hazara people.\"== Background ==Hazaras have been frequently targeted by Taliban and Islamic State militants and other Sunni Muslim militant groups in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.They have been heavily targeted in Afghanistan in attacks claimed by an affiliate of the Islamic State.509 Hazara people has been killed in terror related incidents in the

predominantly Shia.== Blast ==A suicide attack was carried out in the late afternoon of 12 April 2019 by the Sunni militant at a potato stall in a crowded Hazarganji vegetable market.One survivor reported the blast being so powerful that the air was filled with black smoke and people were unable to hear each other.20 people including one paramilitary soldier were killed, as well as the perpetrator.On 16 April, one more paramilitary soldier died of his injuries.== Responsibility ==Initially, no group claimed responsibility for the blast.After some hours, the leader of Sunni militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for the attack and issued a warning that more attacks were planned.A spokesperson of the group, Qari Saifullah, told CNN \"We claim responsibility for the attack in Quetta, we targeted the Hazara community.\"The same group had previously carried out attacks against Hazara minorities.ISIL also claimed the responsibility of this attack, releasing a photograph of the bomber along with his name.Various Sunni militant groups in Pakistan, including  Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, have been backed by ISIL for several years.== Reaction ==Pakistan's ruling Government PTI condemned the attack and wrote on Twitter: \"We strongly condemn the terrorist attack in #Quetta that resulted in the loss of innocent lives.Prayers for the injured and for the precious

demanded security from Prime Minister Imran Khan.Shortly after the bombing struck near a Shiite residential area, dozens of angry Shiite youths rallied in Quetta, demanding more security from the authorities and the arrest of those behind the attacks.They also denounced the violence by Sunni extremists who have killed hundreds in similar attacks over the past years in Balochistan province.\"It seems people from the (Shiite) Hazara community were the target,\" said senior police chief Abdur Razzaq Cheema.Members of the Hazara community staged a sit-in at Quetta's Western Bypass for over 23

Both wore blue jeans and dark hoodies, and had covered their faces.The motive for the attack is unknown.Sergeant Matt Bertram told the Associated Press the two men just \"dropped off this device, and took off right away\".\"We have no indication to call it a hate crime or any kind of terrorism act,\" he added.Canadian broadcaster CBC reported a heavy police presence, complete with \"tactical teams\" - and said an officer on the scene could not say whether there was a further threat to public safety.One eyewitness speaking to CBC said he was at a different restaurant nearby when the explosion happened. He suggested that a birthday party, possibly involving children, was taking place inside Bombay Bhel at the time of the blast.Meanwhile, Indian foreign minister Sushma Swaraj said she was in touch with the country's representatives in Canada following the attack on an Indian restaurant, promising \"our missions will work round the clock\".Mississauga, a large city on the shore of Lake Ontario, borders the larger city of Toronto and is home to Toronto Pearson International Airport.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Transportation cordoned <extra_id_0> Destination plaza <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Intervention helped <extra_id_0> Treater paramedics <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Patient injured <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target restaurant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Mississauga <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> Attacker suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target restaurant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Ontario <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place restaurant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place where <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

But the committee issued a statement saying no evidence has been uncovered linking the group to the bombing that killed 14 people and left dozens more injured.Russian investigators have identified 22-year-old Kyrgyz-born Akbarzhon Dzhalilov as the suicide bomber who carried out the attack.A house in Osh, Kyrgyzstan, belonging to the parents of a man believed to be behind Monday's blast on a subway in St. Petersburg, Russia, April 4, 2017.World leaders from China to Europe to Brazil expressed their condolences over the tragedy. U.S. President Donald Trump phoned Russian President Vladimir Putin and offered full support in responding to the attack.Politicizing the bombingRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the global outpouring Russia received reflected a common understanding of the need to join efforts to fight terrorism instead of trying, according to him, to \u201cuse extremists to reach narrow geopolitical goals.\u201d\"With regard to the argument made by some media that the attack is revenge against Russia for our policy in Syria... [this is] cynical, cowardly,\" said Lavrov, who went on to point a finger at the previous U.S. administration. \"Sadly, this is not just a media fabrication: certain figures, including representatives of Obama administration\u2019s Pentagon, have shared similar thoughts with the world community.\u201dCity on edgeThe attack has left St. Petersburg residents on edge.St. Petersburg emergency services responded Tuesday morning to a bomb threat at a subway station near Monday\u2019s deadly blast on a train as it was passing between two stations.

Authorities briefly closed subway stations. They searched for an unattended item before re-opening the stations.

{"text": "Boston Bombing Suspect Found GuiltyBOSTON \u2014\u00a0Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted on all counts Wednesday in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings by a federal jury that now must decide whether the 21-year-old former college student should be executed.Jurors spent slightly more than 11 hours deciding Tsarnaev's guilt in two days of deliberations after 16 days of testimony.\"It's not something that will ever be over,\" said Karen Brassard, whose ankles and shin were injured by pieces of the bomb. \"You'll feel it forever. It's forever a part of our life. ... I don't know what justice is. I'm grateful to have him off the street.''Two shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the marathon finish line on April 15, 2013, killing three people \u2013 Martin Richard, 8, Chinese student Lingzi Lu, 23, and Krystle Campbell, 29 \u2013 and wounding more than 260 others.Tsarnaev also was convicted in the death of Sean Collier, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology patrol officer shot to death three days later, as Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, attempted to evade police.The defendant, dressed in a blue sweater and dark blazer, looked pale as he entered the courtroom to hear the verdict. His lawyer, Judy Clarke, gave him a brief pat on the back as he sat down.VOA's Fatima Tlisova reported Tsarnaev folded his arms, fidgeted and looked down at the defense table as he listened to one guilty verdict after another on all 30 counts against him, including conspiracy, murder and use of a weapon of mass destruction.There were some families of victims in the courtroom, and their reaction as the verdict was read was very calm, Tlisova observed. She noted, though, they seemed satisfied with the verdict, judging by discussions she had with them outside the courthouse.Seventeen of the counts are capital offenses, making Tsarnaev eligible for the death penalty.\u201cI hope today\u2019s verdict provides a small amount of closure for the survivors, families, and all impacted by the violent and tragic events surrounding the 2013 Boston Marathon,\u201d Boston Mayor Martin Walsh said in a statement. \u201cThe incidents of those days have forever left a mark on our city.\u201dJudy Clarke, left, and David Bruck, defense attorneys for convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, will try to prevent his getting a death sentence. They're shown at the federal courthouse in Boston, Massachusetts, April 6, 2015.Penalty phaseDuring the penalty phase, which could begin as early as Monday, Tsarnaev's lawyers will present so-called mitigating evidence they hope will save his life.That could include evidence about his family, his relationship with his brother, and his childhood in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and later in the volatile Dagestan region of Russia.Tsarnaev's conviction was practically a foregone conclusion: His lawyers admitted he participated in the bombings.But in a bid to save Tsarnaev from a death sentence, defense attorney Clarke argued that Tsarnaev, then 19, fell under the influence of his radicalized older brother. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died when he was shot by police and run over by his brother during a chaotic getaway attempt days after the bombing.\"If not for Tamerlan, it [the bombing] would not have happened,\" Clarke told the jury during closing arguments.Prosecutors laid out evidence that the defendant, an ethnic Chechen who emigrated from Russia a decade before the attack, had read and listened to jihadist materials, and wrote a note in the boat where he was found hiding suggesting the bombing was an act of retribution for U.S. military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries.Jurors' questionsEarlier Wednesday, the jury asked U.S. District Judge George O'Toole to clarify two legal terms.South Boston resident Joe Kebartas, holding a sign reading \"Death Penalty is Murder,\" demonstrates outside the federal courthouse where Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been convicted on all 30 counts, April 8, 2015.They asked about the term \"conspiracy,\" which appears in several of the charges. O'Toole explained it applied to a plot between Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev that existed from February through April 19 of 2013, when the younger brother was caught.Jurors also asked if \"aiding and abetting,\" which also appears in several charges, were separate ideas.

{"text": "Lawyers for the coroner in charge of inquests into the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings have said the hearings will not resolve the \u201cenduring injustice\u201d for victims and their families.Sir Peter Thornton QC is challenging a High Court ruling which ordered him to reconsider his decision to exclude an enquiry into the identities of those who \u201cplanted, planned, procured and authorised the bombs\u201d.The bombings in two city centre pubs, widely believed to be the work of the IRA, killed 21 people and injured 182 \u2013 making it the deadliest peacetime attack in the UK at the time.For the reasons the coroner gave ... these inquests cannot resolve the enduring injustice. Peter Skelton QC, for the coronerOutlining his submissions to the Court of Appeal, Peter Skelton QC said: \u201cThe 21 people who died in the bombings and their families have suffered an enduring injustice.\u201cSo too have those who were injured and their families, and countless others who have been affected.\u201cThe pain and grief they have borne has been exacerbated by the fact no-one has ever been held accountable in law.\u201cBut, for the reasons the coroner gave \u2026 these inquests cannot resolve the enduring injustice.\u201dMr Skelton, representing the coroner, added that the victims, their families and the public interest \u201ccannot be served\u201d by a promised resolution that \u201ccannot be delivered\u201d.Two High Court judges quashed a decision by Sir Peter to exclude the \u201cperpetrator issue\u201d from the new hearings following a judicial review brought on behalf of the bereaved families by Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was 18 when she was killed in the bombings.Ten of the families were in court on Tuesday to hear the appeal before the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Burnett, Lady Justice Hallett and Lord Justice McCombe.They are also arguing it is necessary for the inquests to investigate the perpetrator issue because the police investigation into the bombings resulted in a \u201cnotorious miscarriage of justice\u201d.Six men, known as the Birmingham Six, were imprisoned for the murders and served 17 years behind bars in one of Britain\u2019s most infamous miscarriages of justice before their convictions were quashed.Five West Midlands Police officers were charged with perverting the course of justice in connection with the original criminal investigation, but a judge ruled in 1993 that a fair trial would be impossible.There has never been an effective and independent investigation into who was responsible for the atrocity Hugh Southey QC, for the familesHugh Southey QC, representing the families, said there was the \u201cmost pressing need for a thorough investigation\u201d.He told the court: \u201cThe actions of West Midlands Police officers in the investigation and subsequent criminal convictions are often considered to be the worst miscarriage of justice in British legal history.\u201cThere has never been an effective and independent investigation into who was responsible for the atrocity.\u201cThere is no prospect of such an investigation occurring, apart from within the inquest.\u201cDespite that, the appellant decided not to investigate the issue of who was responsible.\u201dMr Southey later added: \u201cThere is the utmost public interest in the proper investigation of who was responsible for the Birmingham bombings.\u201cThe families of the deceased said to the appellant that the investigation of this issue was so important to them that if it did not form part of the scope of the inquest \u2018we may as well not have an inquest at all\u2019.\u201dSpeaking before the hearing, Mrs Hambleton said: \u201cIt will be utterly redundant to have the inquests unless the perpetrators, their associates and those who prepared and planted the bombs are included.\u201dShe said supporters of the families\u2019 campaign group Justice4the21 have so far raised \u00a375,000 for the case after Mrs Hambleton was refused legal aid.The group held a demonstration outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London in February, supported by members of the Football Lads Alliance.The hearing is due to finish on Tuesday afternoon and the judges are

{"text": "French police are hunting a suspect believed to have deposited a paper bag containing a device that exploded on Friday, wounding 13 people on a busy pedestrian street in the city of Lyon.France\u2019s counter-terrorism prosecutor, Remy Heitz, said an investigation has been opened for an \u201cattempted murder in relation with a terrorist undertaking\u201d and \u201ccriminal terrorist association\u201d.He said no group had yet claimed responsibility for the explosion. Regional authorities said 13 people had suffered mostly minor injuries but 11 were still in hospital on Saturday morning.On Friday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, called the explosion an \u201cattack\u201d.Heitz described video surveillance that showed the suspect heading toward the centre of Lyon by bike on Friday afternoon. The man was seen arriving on foot, pushing his bike along the pedestrian-only Victor Hugo street, then leaving a paper bag on a concrete block in the middle of the street near a bakery.French police issued this photo from CCTV showing a man wanted in connection with the explosion. Photograph: Police National/Handout/EPAThe suspect immediately returned to his bike and left by the same path. One minute later, the explosion shattered the glass of a refrigerator in the bakery, Heitz said.Investigators at the scene have found screws, metallic balls, batteries, a triggering device that can be used remotely and plastic pieces that may come from the explosive device.Police issued an appeal for witnesses on Saturday with a photo of the suspect from video surveillance. They described the man as dangerous. The man was wearing a cap and sunglasses that partially hid his face.Local authorities said security has been enhanced in France\u2019s third-largest city, including more police and military patrols.The Women\u2019s Football World Cup is scheduled to start in France on 7 June. Lyon will host the semi-finals and then the 7 July final. After the explosion, the interior minister, Christophe Castaner, sent instructions for Lyon authorities to strengthen security for \u201cpublic sites and sporting, cultural and religious events\u201d.On Victor Hugo street, police removed the cordon around the explosion area and the atmosphere on Saturday was almost back to normal, with people doing their shopping \u2013 the only oddity being the chalk lines drawn by forensics on the ground.\u201cIt was scary,\u201d said Gisele Sanchez, owner of a haberdashery close to the bakery. Large wood planks covered her shop window, which was damaged by the blast. Police found in her shop screws, metallic balls and batteries believed to be from the device, yet Sanchez was able to reopen on Saturday morning.France is jittery over a spate of attacks in recent years, some of them deadly, carried out by people ranging from extremist attackers to mentally unstable individuals.

{"text": "There have been many terrible events in the history of Northern Ireland's conflict, but few have seared the collective consciousness of its people as those on Friday, 21 July 1972, a day that became known as Bloody Friday.By the end of the day, the IRA's Belfast brigade had detonated at least 20 bombs across the city.In just 75 minutes of violence, nine people were dead and some 130 more were mutilated, injured and mentally scarred by what they had witnessed.You could hear people screaming, crying and moaning. The first thing that caught my eye was a torso of a human being in the middle of the streetPolice officer at the sceneFrom the outset, the IRA's bombing of the city caused widespread chaos and stretched the security forces to the limit.Such was the scale of the attack, witnesses at the time remember seeing people running in all directions, not knowing where the bombs were being detonated.As one report at the time described the scene, \"it was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe\".Car bombsWhile the scale of the attack was huge, it was two car bombs that between them claimed the nine lives - one at the Oxford Street bus station in the city centre, the other outside shops in Cavehill Road in north Belfast.At Oxford St, the busiest bus station in Northern Ireland, four Ulsterbus workers and two soldiers were killed.When the emergency services reached the scene, they found that some of the victims had been literally blown to pieces, leading to initial estimates of a death toll of 11.At the Cavehill Road bomb, the victims were two women and a 14-year-old schoolboy.Of the 130 injured, 77 were women or children out shopping in the city centre. One police officer at the scene recalled the events for the BBC series Provos in 1997.\"You could hear people screaming, crying and moaning. The first thing that caught my eye was a torso of a human being lying in the middle of the street,\" he told the series.Collapsed ceasefireIn terms of furthering its cause among nationalists, the IRA's decision to carry out the Bloody Friday attacks proved to be a disaster.Earlier in the year, the IRA had experienced a massive propaganda and recruitment boost after the Parachute Regiment killed 13 protesters during Bloody Sunday in Derry. Many joined believing that they had no other way to defend their communities.It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time.Former IRA leader Sean MacStiofainBy June, the organisation felt confident enough to call a ceasefire and hold secret talks with British ministers in London. Those talks came to nothing and the ceasefire collapsed.Bloody Friday was part of a deliberate decision to ratchet up a campaign and make normal life impossible.But after causing the deaths, the IRA tried to blame the security forces for failing to act on warnings.Ultimately Bloody Friday revealed a side to the organisation that many who had joined in the wake of Bloody Sunday had not wished to acknowledge.Within 10 days of the attacks, the army moved in to the Bogside area of Derry to take control of a part of the city that had become out-of-bounds, marking the beginning of a long war of attrition by both sides.DenialsIn later years, an IRA leader at the time, Sean MacStiofain, said that the aim of the Bloody Friday attacks had been to cause financial damage - but he still refused to accept responsibility.\"It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time,\" he said.\"Republicans were convinced that the British had deliberately disregarded these two warnings for strategic policy reasons.\"Bloody Friday was by no means the last atrocity of 1972. It remains the bloodiest year of the conflict in Northern Ireland.By the end of 1972, 496 had been killed, 258 of them civilians.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack conflict  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker brigade <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place city <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure mutilated <extra_id_0> Victim more <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim more <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place city <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim 496 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 130 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim protesters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer Parachute Regiment <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Derry <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim workers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Oxford St <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die claimed <extra_id_0> Victim nine lives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Cavehill Road <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack those  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation reached <extra_id_0> Transporter services <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination scene <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die blown <extra_id_0> Victim victims <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die death <extra_id_0> Victim 11 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die bomb <extra_id_0> Victim victims <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact recalled <extra_id_0> Participant BBC <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand call <extra_id_0> Communicator organisation <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact hold <extra_id_0> Participant organisation <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation moved <extra_id_0> Transporter army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination area <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack war  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Sean MacStiofain <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack conflict  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Amid speculation that President Bush is reconsidering what will constitute \"regime change in Iraq,\" one thing should be clear: Saddam Hussein's willingness to \"change\" his attitude towards permitting the resumption of intrusive on-site U.N. weapons inspections will not, in fact, eliminate the danger posed by him and his ruling clique.Indeed, what would be, at best, an ephemeral attitudinal adjustment on Saddam's part would probably not even diminish meaningfully the threat from Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs. After all, were Saddam -- against all odds and past practice -- actually to cooperate with the U.N. inspectors and assist in the complete elimination of his chemical and biological arsenals, he could resume covertly stockpiling them again in as little as six-months time.That period could be still shorter if he were to be rewarded for his \"cooperation\" by the elimination of international economic and trade sanctions against Iraq.A news item published in the London Evening Standard last Monday provides, however, an important reminder of why the United States cannot safely accept any substitute for the toppling of Saddam's regime.Specifically, it summarizes evidence implicating Saddam Hussein in one or more deadly acts of terror against the United States, specifically the Oklahoma City bombing.The Standard article draws on investigative reporting and forensic analysis into the Oklahoma City bombing performed over the past seven years by an intrepid and tenacious former TV journalist, Jayna Davis. She offers compelling, if circumstantial, indications that Iraqi operatives helped to plot, prepare and execute murderous attacks in Oklahoma City (and perhaps against other targets in the United States).For example, Ms. Davis has identified a man whose photo matches that of a \"John Doe #2\" sought immediately after the Murrah Building attack. He appears to be a Palestinian by the name of Hussain Hashem Al Hussaini, who sported a tatoo suggesting he had served in Saddam's elite Republican Guard.According to Davis' evidence, witnesses put Al Hussaini in the company of confessed bomber Timothy McVeigh a few days before the attack and near the site immediately beforehand. Ms. Davis has also found witnesses who say McVeigh and his convicted co-conspirator, Terry Nichols, had consorted with former Iraqi soldiers. Some of these former soldiers worked for a Palestinian who owned a truck very like one sought after the attack. These soldiers reportedly were absent from work on the day of the bombing and were seen celebrating after it occurred. It strains credulity that all of these dots are not connected.What is more, Ms. Davis' evidence appears consistent with findings by another investigator, Dr. Laurie Mylroie, who has devoted years of effort to the pursuit of Iraqi connections to the earlier World Trade Center bombing. Like Ms. Davis, Dr. Mylroie concludes that Saddam's modus operandi is to employ cut-outs to cover his tracks.According to this thesis, the first attempt aimed at destroying the Twin Towers was not exclusively accomplished by followers of a blind Egyptian sheik with ties to Iran. This conclusion was actually a bonus for Hussein, because it vectored blame at Iran, his most formidable enemy and neighbor. Similarly, Oklahoma City was not, as prosecutors claimed, simply the homegrown handiwork of two violently disaffected U.S. citizens.And Sept. 11 was not the product solely of Usama bin Laden's al Qaeda network. In each of these cases, there is reason to believe that Saddam Hussein and his minions played some role in the murder of Americans.To be sure, it is not exactly news that Ms. Davis has concluded that Iraqi operatives were involved in Oklahoma City. What is news is that, according to the Evening Standard, the Bush Justice Department has apparently, finally begun to take a serious interest in Ms. Davis' evidence.Such evidence simply serves strongly to reinforce a reality of which President Bush has long and repeatedly warned: We will enjoy no relief from Saddam's predations unless and until he and his ilk are removed from power in Iraq.The memory of those Americans who have already been murdered by the Butcher of Baghdad and his co-conspirators will be besmirched -- and the fate of untold numbers of their countrymen recklessly jeopardized -- if a temporary adjustment to Saddam's behavior on inspections were to be confused with, and allowed to substitute for, the needed elimination of his regime.Frank J.

{"text": "Boston Bomber Admits Guilt, Receives Death SentenceConvicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev apologized at his sentencing hearing Wednesday before he was formally sentenced to death for the deadly 2013 attack. The 21-year Chechen immigrant stood in a federal courtroom in Boston and admitted that he and his late older brother, Tamerlan, planted two pressure-cooker bombs that exploded near the finish line of the legendary race on April 15, 2013, killing three people and leaving 264 others injured, including 17 who suffered severed limbs. \"I am sorry for the lives that I've taken, for the suffering that I caused you, for the damage I've done, irreparable damage\" Tsarnaev said in his first public remarks since his arrest. But Judge George O'Toole offered no sympathy for Tsarnaev as he handed down the death sentence, saying no one will remember the kind of person he was before the bombing. \"What will be remembered is that you murdered and maimed innocent people, and that you did it willfully and intentionally,\" said O'Toole.Before making his statement, Tsarnaev sat impassively and listened to three hours of testimony from 24 victims and survivors who told how the bombing had adversely affected their lives. The mother of Krystal Campbell, one of the three people killed in the bombing, lashed out at Tsarnaev, saying \"the choices that you made are despicable and what you did to my daughter is disgusting.\"Many of the survivors questioned and even rejected Tsarnaev's expression of remorse, calling it insincere. But one survivor, Henry Borgard, told reporters after the hearing that he accepted Tsarnaev's apology. \"I was actually really happy that he made the statement,\" said Borgard, who was injured as he was walking home from work that day. \"As I said in my personal impact statement, I have forgiven him. I have come to a place of peace and I genuinely hope that he does as well. For me to hear him say that he's sorry, that is enough for me.\" And the father of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was also killed in the attack along with Campbell and Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, said he and his family have moved on. \"He chose hate. He chose destruction. He chose death,\u201d said Bill Richard. \u201cThis is all on him. We choose love. We choose kindness. We choose peace.\u201dThe jury voted unanimously last month to condemn Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death, just days after convicting him on all 30 charges brought against him -- 17 of which carried the possibility of the death penalty. In addition to the three bombing victims, Tsarnaev was also convicted in the death of Sean Collier, a police officer with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department killed during a shootout with the Tsarnaev brothers three days after the attack.His attorneys argued during the penalty phase of the trial that Dzhokhar was under the strong influence of his radicalized older brother, who was killed in the same shootout that killed MIT police officer Collier.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will likely be sent to a federal prison in Indiana to await execution -- a process that could take years as his lawyers appeal his case through the federal court system.

{"text": "Jury Selection Begins in Trial of Accused Boston Bomber's FriendBOSTON \u2014\u00a0Jury selection was set to begin on Monday in a U.S. court in Boston for the trial of the first of three friends of the Boston Marathon bombing suspect, charged with obstructing the investigation into the deadly blasts.Federal prosecutors contend that Kazakh exchange student Azamat Tazhayakov, along with two schoolmates, went to marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth three days after the April 15, 2013, attack and removed a laptop computer and backpack containing empty fireworks shells.One of Tazhayakov's lawyers, Matthew Myers, last week told reporters that his 20-year-old client had rejected a plea deal offered by prosecutors, contending that there was a \u201clack of evidence\u201d to convict the man.A key issue at the trial, set for opening statements next week, will be whether to admit statements that Tazhayakov and fellow Kazakh exchange student Dias Kadyrbayev made to investigators after they were ordered out of their New Bedford, Massachusetts, apartment by heavily armed federal agents and questioned for hours at a police station without having attorneys present.Kadyrbayev, 20, testified at a pretrial hearing early this month that he had not felt that he was free to go during the questioning. The two were arrested on April 20, 2013, on immigration violations.U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock has said he will declare a mistrial if he finds the statements were not voluntary.Three people were killed and 264 injured in the bombing at the historic Boston Marathon.Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov, both charged with obstruction of justice, could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted. A third friend, Robel Phillipos of Cambridge, Massachusetts, faces up to 16 years if convicted of the less serious charge of lying to investigators.Prosecutors have not charged any of the men with a role in the bombing itself. They contend that Tsarnaev, 20, and his brother, Tamerlan, 26, placed two homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the race's crowded finish line and three days later fatally shot a university police officer while attempting to flee the city.Tamerlan died after a gunbattle with police later that night. Dzhokhar is awaiting trial on charges that carry the threat of execution if he is convicted.

{"text": "Father of Chechen Immigrant Shot During Interrogation Denounces FBIThe father of a Chechen immigrant shot dead in Florida while being questioned by the FBI in connection with the April 15 Boston Marathon bombings claims his son was killed \"execution style.\"At a press conference in Moscow on Thursday, Abdul-Baki Todashev displayed photographs showing the body of a young man who looked like his son, Ibragim, with at least seven bullet wounds.Abdul-Baki Todashev called those who shot his son \"bandits\" who should be put on trial.Ibragim Todashev was fatally shot in the city of Orlando on May 22. The FBI said in a statement that day that an FBI special agent, along with two Massachusetts State Police troopers and other law enforcement personnel, were interviewing Todashev in connection with the Boston Marathon bombing investigation, and that he was shot after he initiated a \"violent confrontation.\"According to the bureau, the special agent \"sustained non-life threatening injuries\" during the incident.After the incident, some U.S. media quoted unnamed U.S. officials as saying that Todashev, a 27-year-old mixed martial arts fighter, had lunged at the agent with a knife. On Wednesday, the Washington Post newspaper quoted an unnamed U.S. official as saying that Todashev had lunged at the agent but was unarmed.The FBI said Wednesday that is conducting a review of the incident to determine \"the reasonableness of the application of deadly force.\"The Council on American-Islamic relations, an advocacy group, said Wednesday it is asking the U.S. Department of Justice's civil rights division to investigate the incident.U.S. media also reported that while being questioned by the FBI, Todashev had implicated himself and Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev in a September 2011 triple slaying in a Boston suburb.Todashev formerly lived in the Boston area and trained in martial arts at a gym with Tsarnaev, a Boston resident. Both men were ethnic Chechen immigrants with U.S. resident status.Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police a few days after the Boston Marathon bombings.

{"text": "Accused Boston Bomber Says Satisfied With Defense LawyersBOSTON \u2014\u00a0The Boston Marathon bombing suspect, in his first court appearance in more than a year, told a judge on Thursday that he was satisfied with his lawyers' preparations for the January start of his trial over the deadly 2013 attack.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, was dressed in a dark sweater and wore his hair shaggy for his appearance at U.S. District Court, where he will be tried on charges of killing three people and injuring more than 260 with two homemade bombs at the race's crowded finish line on April 15, 2013, as well as fatally shooting a university police officer three days later.The defendant, who had grown a light beard, appeared in a courtroom packed with victims, supporters and curious onlookers.Tsarnaev looked alert and healthy, showing no signs of the injuries suffered during a gunbattle with police on the night of April 18, 2013, that ended with the death of his brother, Tamerlan, also accused with playing a role in the attack. In his prior court appearance, in July 2013, Tsarnaev's left arm was in a cast and his face appeared swollen.U.S. District Judge George O'Toole asked Tsarnaev if he was satisfied with his defense attorneys in a series of questions intended to avoid any post-trial assertions that he was not provided a proper defense.\"Yes, your honor,\" Tsarnaev replied briefly to questions about whether his attorneys were keeping him abreast of court developments. He looked somewhat fidgety during the 25-minute hearing.O'Toole also said that many of the court documents filed under seal ahead of the trial will be made public after the jury is seated in January.'Stay strong'Tsarnaev faces the possibility of execution if convicted in a trial that is expected to run for three months. The court plans to weed through more than 1,000 people to find 12 jurors and six alternates to hear the case.At the hearing's conclusion, Elena Teyer, 45, whose son-in-law Ibragim Todashev was fatally shot by FBI agents in Florida during an interview about his friendship with Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the weeks after the bombing, shouted support to Tsarnaev in Russian.Outside court, she translated her words for reporters as \"Dzhokhar, we know you're innocent ... stay strong, son.\"A resident of Savannah, Georgia, Teyer said she had traveled to Boston specifically for the hearing.\"You know how hard it is when you have no one near you who is going to support you,\" Teyer said.Thursday's hearing is the final pre-trial conference in Tsarnaev's case. In the weeks leading up to the trial, prosecutors and defense attorneys are disputing a range of issues including how much they must disclose about the witnesses they plan to call.The Tsarnaev brothers had moved to the United States from Russia's restive Chechnya region a decade before the attack.Dzhokhar left a scrawled note inside the dry-docked boat where he was captured in Watertown, Massachusetts, a day after the shootout, indicating that the marathon attack had been motivated by U.S. military campaigns in Muslim countries.Tsarnaev's attorneys had asked that the trial be held outside Boston, contending that since hundreds of thousands of spectators attend the Boston Marathon, it would be all but impossible to find an impartial panel of people who had not been present the day of the attack or known someone who had been.O'Toole had previously denied that request, noting the court had recently seated juries in other high-profile cases, including the 2013 trial of former mob boss James \"Whitey\" Bulger, who was found guilty of racketeering and murder.On his way into court, one of the bombing's victims, Marc Fucarile, confronted a small group of protesters who asserted the evidence of the bombing was fabricated. Fucarile grabbed the prosthetic limb that replaced the right leg he lost in the bombing, saying he considered that proof enough.Asked about the incident, Fucarile said, \"They have a right to their opinion, same as anybody else.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing trial <extra_id_0> Defendant his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing tried <extra_id_0> Defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim 260 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die fatally <extra_id_0> Victim officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shooting <extra_id_0> Target officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die death <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing hearing <extra_id_0> Defendant He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shot <extra_id_0> Place Florida <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker agents <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Ibragim Todashev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die fatally <extra_id_0> Victim Ibragim Todashev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer agents <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Florida <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing hearing <extra_id_0> Defendant Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation moved <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination United States <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin Chechnya <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker Dzhokhar <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shootout <extra_id_0> Attacker Dzhokhar <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing trial <extra_id_0> Defendant James \"Whitey\" Bulger <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict found guilty <extra_id_0> Defendant James \"Whitey\" Bulger <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target Marc Fucarile <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "THE TWIN TOWERS; Deadly Bomb Was Cheap and Easily Made, Experts SayThe bomb that savaged the World Trade Center, investigators and explosive experts said yesterday, apparently was put together with ordinary chemicals that are widely and cheaply available at chemical supply houses and gardening centers throughout the country.Experts now estimate that the bomb weighed about 1,000 pounds and that the chemicals to make it were bought for a little more than $400.Though a young chemical engineer was arrested yesterday in connection with the explosion, the experts say that such a bomb could have been made by almost anyone with the help of one of scores of manuals, obtainable in bookstores and libraries, that provide step-by-step instructions.\"It's very easy to make one of these things,\" said Edward M.Roy, an explosives expert at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, N.M. \"I tell my students, a lot of explosives I can make in my wastebasket.\"A Jumble of ChemicalsFollowing the trail of Mohammed A. Salameh, the \ufb01rst suspect arrested in the bombing, investigators discovered a jumble of chemicals, chemistry implements and detonating materials stacked in a storage locker at 69 Mallory Avenue in Jersey City that they say may also have served as the bomb laboratory.The day before the explosion that killed at least \ufb01ve people and injured more than 1,000 others, Mr.Salameh and several other men made \"numerous trips\" to the locker, which Mr.Salameh had rented for $97 a month late last year, the authorities say.The suspects traveled in a yellow Ford van, the investigators say, which has been identi\ufb01ed as the vehicle that carried the explosive into the underground garage of the World Trade Center.A Thick PasteThe investigators and experts say that after mixing the three main chemicals -- nitric and sulfuric acids and urea, a common ingredient in fertilizers -- into a thick paste, the bombers are believed to have packed the material into half a dozen or so cardboard boxes.They simply loaded the boxes loosely into the van, without using a special container for them, the investigators believe, and drove across the Hudson River to the trade center.The bombers ignited their concoction, investigators believe, with several smaller nitroglycerine bombs, which themselves were touched off with the kind of blasting cap routinely used at construction and mining sites across the country.The blasting cap is the only ingredient in the deadly mix, the experts and law-enforcement of\ufb01cials say, that requires a license or permit for purchase, and most probably was stolen.Manuals Were FoundThe investigators said they found manuals for bomb making in one of the apartments that they raided after arresting Mr.Salameh.Neil C.Livingstone, the president of the Institute on Terrorism and Sub-National Con\ufb02ict in Washington, said that as a test of how easy it was to obtain such guides to destruction, he recently wrote to a publishing house using a child's lined notepad and a crayon.Three of the bomb-making manuals were promptly delivered to the address Mr. Livingstone had given, he said, no questions asked.Though building the bomb was relatively easy, the experts say, it was not by any means free of danger.The bulkiest part of the bomb, they say, was extremely stable and could only have been touched off with a tremendous kick, like that provided by nitroglycerine.Making the nitroglycerine, by blending some of the chemicals, was the trickiest part of the process.As the chemicals are mixed to form this compound, said Dr. Per-Anders Persson, the director of the center for explosives research at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, they get hot and may explode.Often, he said, beakers are packed in dry ice to keep the chemicals at a safe temperature.A Dangerous MixThe nitroglycerine could have also exploded prematurely with any jolt or sharp change in temperature, the experts said.The bombers risked blowing themselves up as well, the experts said, when they hooked up the wires connecting the bomb's trigger with the blasting cap.Dr.Robert H. Kupperman, a senior adviser for science and technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University, said that perhaps the greatest skill in making the bomb came in rigging the chain of triggering explosives so they all tore into the bulk of the bomb for maximum effect, as investigators at the World Trade Center say apparently happened.So far, in more than a week of searching, they have not found a single grain of the main explosive material.Sulfuric Acid Widely SoldWilliam Lazor, a senior technical consultant at the Du Pont Company in Wilmington, Del., said that sulfuric acid is the most widely sold chemical in the United States, used in the manufacture of everything from battery acid to detergents and shampoos.Dale Ladysh, another consultant at Du Pont, said that nitric acid is only slightly behind in popularity.It is used, he said, in the electronics industry and for making stainless steel and many industrial dies and pigmentations.Both acids are commonly used metal cleaners.According to Rick Amberg of Amberg Perennial Farm and Garden Center in West\ufb01eld, N.J., urea is often scattered over lawns to make them grow lustrously, and is also used in making plastics.Mr. Amberg sells a plastic 50-pound bag of urea for $20.99.In Newark, the Dooner & Smith Chemical Company sells a 15-gallon drum of sulfuric acid, weighing 172 pounds, for $41.28.The same size container of nitric acid costs $44 and weighs 220 pounds.\"Whoever put that thing together really intended to do a lot of damage,\" said Mr.Roy.\"This kind of explosive device is often used to fracture and move rock.It expands slowly with great force.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack savaged <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target World Trade Center <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble put together <extra_id_0> Components chemicals <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell bought <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity chemicals <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PaymentBarter $400 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee engineer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble make  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble make <extra_id_0> Artifact explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Mohammed A.

{"text": "Thai Police Arrest Bombing SuspectBANGKOK \u2014\u00a0Police in Thailand arrested a suspect Saturday in connection with the bombing earlier this month that killed 20 people.The man, described as a foreigner, was being charged with possessing explosives and was in military custody, authorities told reporters.The suspect was also found with ball bearings, fuses, pipes and other bomb-making materials, as well as a stack of Turkish passports, police and army officials said.All Thai television channels carried a brief broadcast by the Thai military junta at 6 p.m. Saturday announcing the arrest.National police chief General Somyot Poompanmoung speaks to reporters outside the compound where police detained a suspect in the August 17 Bangkok shrine bombing, in a Bangkok suburb on Aug. 29, 2015.It was the first big breakthrough since the August 17 blast at the popular Erawan Hindu Shrine in central Bangkok killed 20 people \u2014 Thais, Chinese, Malaysians, a Singaporean and an Indonesian \u2014 and wounding more than 100 people of numerous nationalities.The bombing was the worst single mass casualty attack in Thailand.It was followed a day later by an explosion in the Chao Praya river adjacent to the Sathorn pier, about five kilometers away from the shrine. No one was injured in that detonation.Authorities believe a separate man on the King Taksin Bridge, around the time of the shrine blast, had dropped a time bomb into the river.The military junta\u2019s announcement came hours after a \u201cforeign man,\u201d said to be 28 years of age, was taken into custody on the eastern fringe of Bangkok.A police source said the arrest of the suspect, who is believed to be Turkish, came after investigators sifting through records of mobile phone calls identified three Turkish numbers, which had been activated by international roaming services near the blast site, according to the Sunday edition of the Bangkok Post. Earlier, authorities had told reporters that a tip from a landlord had led them to the suspect whose apartment building was surrounded by more than 100 police and soldiers on Saturday. Thai police stand on the balcony outside of an apartment building in Nong Jok on the outskirts of Bangkok, Aug. 29, 2015. Thai police say they arrested a suspect in the blast at the Erawan Shrine in this apartment building.The bomb-making materials found at the apartment were similar to those used at the Erawan Hindu Shrine and were linked to the second explosion as well.The suspect's identity remained unclear, but \"we found he's connected to both Bangkok blasts,\" said national police spokesman Prawut Thavornsiri. \"We believe the perpetrators are from the same group.\u201dThe Thai national police chief told reporters Saturday evening that the attacks were \u201cnot an international terrorist act.\u201dA handout photo from the Royal Thai police and released on August 29, 2015 shows the suspect which is being detained at a police station in Bangkok.The motive by the main culprit was instead \"taking personal revenge for his comrades,\u201d asserted Police General Somyot Pumpanmuang, without elaborating on how authorities had quickly reached that conclusion.The suspect was being questioned late Saturday in the presence of officials of the Turkish Embassy, local media reported.Police released a copy of the photo page of one of the Turkish passports with the arrested man\u2019s photo. It was quickly alleged on social media that the passport was a crude forgery with two dates of expiry and several misspellings in Turkish.A search was underway for more than 10 additional suspects, some of whom were already believed to have left the kingdom, police said, but they had been ruled out as being part of a wider international terrorist network.The Thai police have come under criticism for their investigation, in which they had released contradictory information about possible suspects in the bombing.The prime suspect was captured on closed circuit television \u2014 a man in a yellow T-shirt who left a bag at the shrine just before the explosion.This Aug. 17, 2015, image, released by Royal Thai Police spokesman Lt. Gen. Prawut Thavornsiri shows a man wearing a yellow T-shirt near the Erawan Shrine before an explosion occurred in Bangkok.Authorities denied to VOA that Chinese were likely the primary target.In recent days speculation had increased about a possible link to China's ethnic Uighur minority or their co-religious sympathizers in Turkey.Thailand\u2019s military government last month forcibly repatriated more than 100 Turkey-bound Uighur refugees to China, a move condemned by international human rights groups.That led to an attack on the Thai consulate in Istanbul where windows were smashed.VOA's Ron Corben contributed to this report.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer Police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact broadcast <extra_id_0> Place Thai <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator junta <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain detained <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Bangkok <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Bangkok <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounding <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place Thailand <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place Chao Praya river <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonation  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim No one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact announcement <extra_id_0> Communicator junta <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain detained <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator media <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle smashed <extra_id_0> Artifact windows <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target consulate <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact asserted <extra_id_0> Communicator Police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Bogot\u00e1 car bomb: Colombia blames ELN rebels for deadly explosion Published duration 18 January 2019image copyright Reuters image caption The explosion outside a police academy shocked the Colombian capitalColombia has blamed the left-wing National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group for a car bomb attack that killed 21 people in the capital, Bogot\u00e1.Dozens more were injured in Thursday's blast after an explosives-laden vehicle broke into the grounds of a police academy before it detonated.The driver, who was also killed, has been identified as a 57-year-old man.President Ivan Duque put peace talks with the ELN on hold when he took power in 2018.Any restart to the negotiations is unlikely following the attack, the deadliest in the country in many years, correspondents say.What has the government said?The driver, named earlier as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, was a long-time ELN member and the group's top explosives expert, Defence Minister Guillermo Botero said.The suspect, known by his war alias \"El Mocho\" or \"Kiko\", had lost his right hand in an accident with an explosive and was based in the northern department of Arauca, from where he frequently crossed into Venezuela.\"This was an operation that has been planned for the past 10 months,\" Mr Botero said, adding that the guerrillas were the \"intellectual authors\" behind the driver's attack.A second man who had \"participated\" in the carrying out of the attack was arrested in Bogot\u00e1, Attorney General N\u00e9stor Humberto Mart\u00ednez said.image copyright EPA image caption A vigil was held in Bogot\u00e1 on Thursday to honour the victimsPresident Duque, who visited the site of the explosion on Thursday, described the attack as a \"crazy terrorist act\".\"We won't rest until we capture and bring to justice the terrorists involved,\" he said. \"Colombians have never yielded to terrorism, we have always defeated it. This will not be an exception.\"Colombia's High Commissioner for Peace Miguel Ceballos said there would be \"no space for dialogue with the ELN until they hand over all the kidnapped people and completely renounce their criminal acts.\"What do we know about the explosion?The grey Nissan Patrol entered the compound of the General Santander police academy in the south of Bogot\u00e1 where a promotion ceremony for cadets was being held.When the car was stopped by guards at a checkpoint, the driver accelerated and hit a wall, at which point the vehicle exploded.The vehicle was carrying 80kg (176lb) of the powerful explosive pentolite, which has been used in the past by Colombia's rebel guerrilla groups.The blast at 09:30 local time (14:30 GMT) shattered windows of nearby buildings.image copyright EPA image caption The explosion happened outside a school for police cadetsTwenty of the victims were police cadets aged between 17 and 22, Mr Botero said.At least 68 people were injured but the majority of those have since been discharged from hospital.Who are the ELN rebels?image copyright Getty Images image caption The group has been fighting the Colombian state for more than five decadesThe 2,000-strong guerrilla group was founded in 1964 to fight against Colombia's unequal distribution of land and riches, inspired by the Cuban revolution of 1959Over the decades, the group has attacked large landholders and multinational companies, and repeatedly blown up oil pipelinesTo finance itself it has resorted to extortion, kidnappings and drug traffickingIt has been strongest in rural areasWhat's the current situation in Colombia?Car bombs were not uncommon during the decades-long conflict between the Colombian government and left-wing rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc).But an explosion of a car bomb of this size is something that has not happened in a long time in Bogot\u00e1 and it took the city by surprise, BBC Mundo Colombia correspondent Boris Miranda reports.Colombia has significantly reduced bomb attacks and murders in recent years but the attack shows that it is a continuing fear for citizens, our correspondent adds.The Farc signed a peace agreement with the government in November 2016 and the group has since become a political party of the same name.The party's leader, Pastor Alape, condemned the attack. , calling it a \"provocation against the political way out of the conflict\".Peace talks between the smaller ELN and the previous government of President Juan Manuel Santos stalled, and President Duque, who takes a more hardline approach to the group, has not resumed them.Related Topics BogotaColombia", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Attacker rebels <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice car bomb: <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Target academy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place capital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice car bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker National Liberation Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place capital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer National Liberation Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim more <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injurer National Liberation Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target academy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle broke <extra_id_0> Instrument vehicle <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim driver <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer driver <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Place Bogot\u00e1 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict kidnapped  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation entered <extra_id_0> Vehicle Nissan Patrol <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination compound <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice pentolite <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle shattered <extra_id_0> Artifact windows <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle blown up <extra_id_0> Artifact pipelines <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice car bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Bogot\u00e1 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacked <extra_id_0> Attacker group <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target landholders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Oklahoma City Bombing Documentary Examines Growth of American ExtremismWASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0The Oklahoma City bombing nearly 22 years ago was an act of domestic terror by U.S. military veteran Timothy McVeigh and his accomplice, Terry Nichols. The bombing destroyed one third of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, killing 168 people and injuring 680 others. In his documentary, Oklahoma City, filmmaker Barak Goodman revisits the bombing as the first major domestic terrorist attack in the United States on April 19, 1995.It was the number of civilians killed - especially the 15 children, four of them infants, crushed inside the building's day care center - that made this terrorist attack by a massive fertilizer bomb so heinous for many Americans. Many films have recounted the story, but Goodman\u2019s documentary treats the Oklahoma City bombing as a springboard to examine the roots of America's ultra-right militia and to analyze the makeup of homegrown American terrorism.History of suspicion\u201cIt goes all the way back to the founding of the Republic,\u201d the filmmaker told VOA. \"The Republic was founded on the suspicion of government.\" Goodman says many of these extreme separatists believe in white supremacy and in unregulated freedom to keep and bear arms so that they can protect themselves from outsiders and the government.In the documentary, former militia member Kerry Noble explains the ideology. \u201cThe government is an enemy of the people, and in this war it\u2019s an all or nothing. We\u2019re either gonna win as the white race or we\u2019re gonna lose.\u201d FILE - In this April 21, 1995 file photo, Timothy McVeigh is led out of the Noble County Courthouse by state and federal law enforcement officials in Perry, Oklahoma, after being identified as a suspect in the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal building. McVeigh was eventually convicted of the bombing and executed.Oklahoma City points to two events in the late 20th century that bolstered separatist ideologies: The Ruby Ridge incident on August 21, 1992, and the Waco siege in Waco, Texas, between February 28 and April 19, 1993. In both cases, federal and local government agents clashed with American separatists. The deadly incidents were fueled by the authorities' demand to search the premises for illegal firearms.The Waco siege was particularly deadly. The compound belonged to a group known as the Branch Davidians, led by David Koresh. When federal authorities sent in armed agents and armored vehicles to end the standoff, a fire engulfed the compound, killing 82 people, including David Koresh. Sixty-two of the victims were women and children.Birth of an extremistTimothy McVeigh, a Gulf War veteran disillusioned by the government during his tour in Iraq, was among those who went to witness the siege. According to the documentary, McVeigh was radicalized by those events and by an extremist publication called The Turner Diaries.\u201cIt\u2019s a Talisman for the far right, even to this day, but especially back in the '90s and '80s it was the \u2018Bible\u2019 of this movement,\u201d says Goodman. \u201cIt\u2019s a novel about a small group of \u2018patriots,\u2019 \u2018white patriots\u2019 who retake the government from the Jews and blacks who have infiltrated it, essentially. It\u2019s a racist creed and as I said, it is very poorly done. Intriguingly though, it describes the bombing of the FBI, the culmination of the novel, and it really lays out a recipe on how to build a bomb like this.\"That bomb is very similar to the one McVeigh used in Oklahoma City.\"McVeigh was deeply, deeply influenced by this book,\" Goodman adds. \"He sold it in gun shows, he quoted it, when he was arrested he had several pages of it in a folder beside him in a car. And it wasn\u2019t just McVeigh, it was all through this movement. People were really exorcised, impassioned, inflamed by this novel.\"FILE - In this May 5, 1995, photo, search and rescue personnel attend a memorial service in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma, destroyed by a fertilizer bomb in what is considered the first major domestic terrorist attack in the U.S.The documentary shows McVeigh obsessed with his guns and with the idea that the government was going to take them away. The film also points out that his exposure to the war in Iraq accelerated his feeling of mistrust of the U.S. government. \u201cThe way he put it made it sound he was emphatic towards the dead Iraqi soldiers that he killed. I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case,\u201d says Barak Goodman. Instead, says the filmmaker, it was McVeigh\u2019s mistrust of the U.S. government, how it had blundered into Iraq and his idea of the U.S. government as a bully, and McVeigh, says Goodman, hated bullies. The Ruby Ridge and Waco stand-offs reinforced that idea in his mind.Homegrown extremismAccording to the documentary, there are 500 militia organizations in the U.S. today. Goodman believes they are as radicalized as ever. \u201cSome of them have gotten rid of their camouflage outfits and put on suits and ties, but really the rhetoric has been virtually the same for 100 years or more. \u2018It\u2019s a whites-only country, it should be a whites-only country, the federal government is in the hands of Jews, blacks, it\u2019s a conspiracy.'\u201dGoodman says it is a misconception to believe that this is a movement of white poor disenfranchised people. Certainly, he says, many are, but there also many professionals feeling a loss of entitlement, a loss of privilege and power. The filmmaker stresses that these people operate outside political parties and share a deep mistrust of the Washington political establishment.But Goodman cautions these extremists are not de facto terrorists. He says it takes a confluence of opportunity and a warped personality, often a lone individual, to commit a terrorist act of a scale such as the Oklahoma City bombing.\u201cMcVeigh was a shock to most people in the FBI. It would be less of a shock today. But it\u2019s very hard to prevent these things. One of the takeaways from our film and audiences who have seen it have been amazed at how really easy it was to do this. It cost about $6000, it was one guy, reading some literature,\u201d says the filmmaker.FILE - A member of a white supremacy group gives a fascist salute during a gathering in West Allis, Wisconsin, Sept. 3, 2011. \"The number of hate groups in the United States rose for a second year in a row in 2016 as the radical right was energized by the candidacy of Donald Trump,\u201d according to the Southern Law Poverty Center, a U.S. rights group.Goodman says in a politically polarized America, the possibility for future domestic terrorist attacks is high. \u201cIf you talk to people from the Southern Law Poverty Center, which tracks these groups, they are pounding on the wall, they are ringing the bell, they are saying, \u2018This is an ongoing threat, it\u2019s threat level midnight, it's rising, it's whatever the highest color is on the chart,'\u201d he says.The SPLC reports, \u201cthe number of hate groups in the United States rose for a second year in a row in 2016 as the radical right was energized by the candidacy of Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cThe most dramatic growth,\u201d it states, \u201cwas the near-tripling of anti-Muslim hate groups \u2013 from 34 in 2015 to 101 last year.\u201d Also, a wave of bomb threats and vandalism has rattled Jewish institutions around the country, but especially in the South. \u201cRight now, minorities feel particularly threatened,\u201d says the Oklahoma City filmmaker.\u201cThere is a very big difference between even hard gun rights activists and terrorists. I want to make that clear,\u201d says Goodman. \u201cI would take issue with the idea that they have infiltrated the administration. But it is a little galling to see the really mono focus on terrorists from abroad, terrorists influenced by ideas from abroad, whatever those ideas might be, and not on any real discussion about home-grown terrorism which has always been with us and which is not going away and which is actually -- if you look at the numbers of the incidents -- rivaling or exceeding those by that other group,\u201d he adds.Goodman hopes his film, Oklahoma City, will call attention to this rising threat and contribute to the conversation on the inherent dangers of domestic terrorism.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker Terry Nichols <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Oklahoma City <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant McVeigh <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim David Koresh <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble build <extra_id_0> Artifact bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target Oklahoma City <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The King's Cross station and Euston station bombings were two bombing attacks on 10 September 1973 by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) that targeted two mainline railway stations in central London. The blasts wounded 13 civilians, some of whom were seriously injured, and also caused large-scale but superficial damage. This was a second wave of bombing attacks launched by the IRA in England in 1973 after the Old Bailey car bombing earlier in the year which had killed one  and injured around 200 civilians.==Background==In 1971, during The Troubles, after two years engaged in violence based on a defensive strategy in Irish communal districts of Northern Ireland, the Provisional IRA launched an offensive against the United Kingdom. At a meeting of the IRA Army Council in June 1972 the organization's Chief of Staff, Se\u00e1n Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in, first proposed making bombing attacks in England. The Army Council did not at first agree to the suggestion, but in early 1973 after its negotiations with the British Government for a truce the previous year had failed to advance the political objective of the removal of Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom by the application of the threat of violence, it re-engaged its paramilitary campaign and sanctioned Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in's proposal. Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in had put the strategy forward on the basis that extending the urban paramilitary violence of the Northern Ireland state into England would help to relieve pressure being exerted by the British Army on the IRA's strongholds of Irish communal support in districts in the province, such as West Belfast and Derry, by diverting British security strength from them back into England, whilst at the same time increasing strategic pressure upon the British Government to resolve the conflict by political concessions to the IRA's demands. He also believed that a successful bombing campaign in London, as the capital city of the United Kingdom, would offer substantial propaganda value for paramilitary Irish Republicanism, and provide a morale boost to its supporters.The effects of the previous 1973 Old Bailey bombing appeared to give some credence to the idea of the propaganda value of extending violence into London as, although it would have been considered almost routine in Northern Ireland by the mid-1970s and have drawn only brief media notice, being carried out instead in London, a global capital city, had made the event world news headlines. However, although the bombing of the Old Bailey had been successfully carried out, and had gained media attention, increasing political pressure upon the British Government to address the issue of the conflict in Northern Ireland with more urgency, it had been costly to the IRA, as 10 out of the 11 man Active Service Unit that had carried it out had been arrested by the British police whilst trying to leave England before the bombs they had planted detonated. Drawing the tactical lesson that large teams were a security liability, for the second wave of bombings in England later in 1973, instead of sending a large team to carry it out with orders to withdraw back to Ireland immediately afterwards, smaller detached \"cell\" units of about 3-4 personnel were sent to carry out the operation, with instructions to remain in England afterwards and wage a campaign of bombings around England upon a variety of targets.There were bombings on 8 September 1973, including one at Victoria railway station which injured four civilians.==Bombings==On 10 September 1973 a bomb (with no warning issued beforehand) exploded at King's Cross railway station in the booking hall at 12.24 p.m. when a youth of around 16/17 years of age walked up to the entrance of the station's old booking hall and threw a bag into it which contained a 3\u00a0lb (1.4\u00a0kg) device, which detonated, shattering glass throughout the hall and throwing a baggage trolley several feet into the air. The youth then fled into the station's crowd and escaped the scene.Approximately 45 minutes after the attack at King's Cross, after a telephone called warning 5 minutes beforehand by a man with an Irish accent to the Press Association, a second bomb detonated in a snack bar at Euston railway station, injuring another eight civilians. One witness at Euston said: \"I saw a flash and suddenly people were being thrown through the air - it was a terrible mess, they were bleeding and screaming\" A total of 13 civilians were injured in the two attacks. The Metropolitan Police issued a photofit picture of a 5\u00a0ft 2 tall 16/17-year-old youth they were seeking in regard to the King's Cross attack.==Subsequent events==On 12 September 1973 two more bombs exploded, one in Oxford Street and another in Sloane Square, targeting retail shopping centres. Police subsequently announced that they were looking for five people in connection with this second wave of bomb attacks in England.Judith Ward was later wrongly convicted for having been involved in the late 1973 London bombings, along with the M62 coach bombing. She was later acquitted. No one else was brought to trial for this IRA bombing campaign.==See also==*Bombings of Paddington and Victoria stations *Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1970\u201379)==Sources==* CAIN project * BBC ON THIS DAY  Bomb blasts rock central London ==References==", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target Euston station <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place England <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target Old Bailey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Place England <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Se\u00e1n Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target Old Bailey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target Old Bailey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Attacker England <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Target Victoria railway station <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target hall <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack threw <extra_id_0> Attacker youth <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure bleeding <extra_id_0> Victim they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target King's Cross <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Sloane Square <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target centres <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place England <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant Judith Ward <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Place London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target M62 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack Bombings <extra_id_0> Target stations <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice Bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Multiple outlets, law enforcement officials, and President Obama responded throughout a manic Monday with news that a horrific looking scene made clear in downtown Boston, even as a frenzied search for more potential explosive devices continued and hospitals rushed to help survivors: The crowd at the finish line of the Boston Marathon was bombed twice in what is being described as both a coordinated \"event\" and \"an act of terror\" with more than 140 people brutally injured at eight Boston hospitals and at least three dead, including a young child.Indeed, even as a city and a nation came together amidst the chaotic scene, there was not much good news in Boston this April 15 \u2014 the annual Patriot Day, a Massachusetts festival holiday with schools and offices closed for the marathon and, on this particular day, tragedy in the happiest of places.The FBI has taken over \"a potential terrorist investigation,\" FBI special agent in charge Richard DesLauriers said at a Monday evening press conference.\"There is no suspect\" at the hospital, Boston Police commissioner Ed Davis said at the briefing, despite reports to the contrary \u2014 and speculation that there was still one or multiple persons of interest being questioned at the hospital.When asked if there was a person of interest at the hospital, DeLaurio declined to comment; he also declined to comment on a Wall Street Journal report that there were five additional devices, which was soon clarified to note that \"investigators now doubt the devices were bombs\" \u2014 just one of many conflicting reports citing anonymous law enforcement officials as the investigation began.(And that's not counting the conspiracy theories.)After the death toll had stood at two for much of the day, Davis confirmed at the evening event that \"at least three people have died\" in the marathon bombing.Governor Deval Patrick said \"we are asking that everyone be at a state of heightened vigilance\" as Boston planned to re-open on Tuesday, though he said it \"will not be business as usual.\"Boston police and the FBI were scheduled to hold another news conference at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday morning.At a late afternoon press conference with Patrick, Davis initially reported a third explosion at JFK Library in Boston, which has since been given the all-clear as a separate fire.At a second police briefing, Davis said \"we have no suspect in custody,\" as CNN reported that the FBI had classified the event as a terrorist attack.Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein classified it as a \"terrorist incident\" that \"could be be foreign, could be homegrown.\"At a White House briefing shortly after 6 p.m. Eastern time on a quiet day in Washington, President Obama reiterated that federal and local investigators are still in the investigation phase.He did not use the words \"terror\" or \"terrorist\" or \"attack,\" instead using the words \"unnecessary loss\" \u2014 \"America will say a prayer for Boston tonight,\" he said \u2014 before delivering a more forceful message:We don't yet have all the answers ...We still do not know who did this or why...But make no mistake we will get to the bottom of this.We will find out who did this ... and any responsible groups will feel the full weight of justice.NBC News and others reported that the White House said the bombings would be \"approached as an act of terror.\"Both Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will meet with Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel on Tuesday.As the investigation continues and news reports continue to make sense of the fallout, you can follow the Boston police scanner, the Boston Globe live blog, and the local CBS, ABC, and Fox stations \u2014 as well as some solid Twitter lists.The basic details of the bombings, however, are starting to come into focus.After two explosions hit at around 2:50 p.m. Boston Police would go on to confirm at least three dead \u2014 NBC News cited law enforcement officials as saying one was an eight-year-old child, a report confirmed by the Boston Globe \u2014 and 141 injuries.As for the two bombs that caused the carnage, it appears they were fairly unsophisticated devices, perhaps pipe bombs stuffed with ball bearings, which doctors later reported pulling out of victims' flesh.ABC News reported that the explosions were triggered by remote detonation, but there's still strikingly little known about the other specifics.Meanwhile, there were gruesome images and raw footage from Copley Square area to makeshift tents, from Boston hospitals to Instagram feeds, of lost limbs, hair on fire, children with severe burns, and worse.Scroll down for all the details on the victims, the persons of interest, the moment of horror, and eyewitness accounts.You can follow all of The Atlantic Wire's ongoing Boston Marathon bomb coverage right here \u2014 and our Day Two aftermath updates here.The CasualtiesThe Boston Marathon is tracking runners here, and for those looking for information on loved ones, here are the best ways online.Also, phone numbers: for families of victims, call 617-635-4500; for tips, call 1-800-494-TIPS.The Boston chapter of the American Red Cross said on Monday evening that there was no need for additional blood donations \"at this time\" as their shelves were full.The Red Cross also opened a disaster response center for the recovery effort.Reports of casualties are largely unconfirmed and varying, but here they are, updated in relative real time.In a Monday night press conference, Dr. Peter Fagenholz, a trauma surgeon at Mass.General Hospital, explained that most of the casualties were vascular, bone-related or soft tissue injuries, and that there had been \"several\" amputees.Fagenholz explained that he started his day in surgery at 8 a.m., and after the explosion worked nonstop until the press conference.Other local hospitals \u2014 some of the best in the nation \u2014 are flooded:Injury count as of 745 pm by hospital: Boston Children\u2019s 8; Brigham 27; BMC 23; MGH 22; BI 21; St E's, 15; Tufts 9 \u2014 The Boston Globe (@BostonGlobe) April 16, 2013An update at the official law enforcement press conference Monday night put the casualty count at 141 injured, at least 15 of them critically.CNN reported that at least ten limbs were lost due to the explosions and doctors were picking ball bearings, a common shrapnel generator in pipe bombs, out of victims.The New York Post reported 12 casualties, and is further reporting that authorities say a suspect in detention is a Saudi national\u2014officials have not confirmed this and Boston PD has not confirmed this.CBS News is reporting that Boston PD has video of someone \"bringing multiple backpacks to blast site.\"There are various reports on Twitter of a suspect being detained, but Davis, the police commissioner, maintainted taht \"we have no suspect in custody,\" seeming to cast doubt on reports quoting a federal law enforcement official in the Post and elsewhere.Among the reported 141 injured a nine-year-old girl, a seven-year-old boy, a 12-year-old, and a two-year-old, according to The Boston Globe.Of the three dead, one is reportedly an eight-year-old boy.The \"Person of Interest\"For now, Boston Police say that there are no suspects, but when asked about scattered reports about a person of interest, officials \u2014 including the new FBI investigator \u2014 would not comment, though law enforcement officials maintain, however anonymously, that there are several active leads.Throughout the day and ahead of other media outlets, a law enforcement official kept telling the New York Post about a \"Saudi national\" as a potential suspect or person of interest, leading to many questions as well as similar reports from Fox News.Another report in the Los Angeles Times said one person \u2014 not a \"suspect,\" but apparently a Saudi national \u2014 was being questioned.\"A federal law enforcement officials said authorities were questioning a Saudi national who was taken to a Boston hospital with injuries,\" the report reads.\"The person was not identified as a suspect.\"Later on Monday evening The Globe reported that authorities were \"questioning person of interest in Marathon bombings at Brigham and Women's Hospital\" but did not provide any details about the person's nationality.However, the paper maintains, \"The situation remains fluid and it remains too early to establish the cause and motivation.\"Officials didn't offer much more clarity at the official press conference on Monday night and appear to be approaching the situation with caution.The New York Times reports, \"Although investigators confirmed that they were speaking to a Saudi citizen, several law enforcement officials took pains to note that no one was being held in custody.\"Meanwhile, the FBI is asking for people to send in any info \u2014 photos, video, tips \u2014 or to call 1-800-CALL-FBI with information regarding the explosions.The investigation remains in the early stages, and the public is clearly pouncing on any sign of a lead.Reports of a police search at a Revere, Mass.condo complex between five and six on Monday night lit up Twitter.However, it's unclear if the search was related to a bombing or not.The Other DevicesSoon after the initial explosions, Boston Globe photographer David L. Ryan reported that he heard but did not see a third explosion, and Boston police were scrambling to contain the scene.\"There were two booms heard from near the finish line\" reports the AP.A spokeswoman at the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel, close to the explosion, says that it was around two blocks away, while The Boston Globe said that police were conducting a \"controlled explosion\" on the 600 block of Boylston Street.Over the course of the afternoon and evening, police say they found five additional devices along the marathon route, though a police source later said it was unclear if they were actually bombs.That number does not include numerous reports of suspicious packages around Boston and neighboring cities.The Boston Globe reported another device found near Harvard, and there was a bomb threat phoned in near the Financial District.There were also reports of undetonated devices being found as far away as Newton, though local police have denied those claims.Again, the Journal walked back its initial claim of the five unexploded devices.And then there was the library fire, which had a whole back-and-forth narrative of its own.Here's an updated interactive map of the at times confounding activity, including multiple reported incidents about unconfirmed devices, fires, and all the explosions throughout Monday, both alleged and confirmed, for a sense of scale in downtown Boston and beyond \u2014 even as the day seemed to settle on the two explosions near the finish line:The FBI said on Monday evening that local police and federal agents would sweep the entire length of the course to look for evidence and additional devices.Meanwhile, the Navy has sent an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team to help with the effort.The Pictures and Video of the ExplosionHere are a couple of many images to flow in from social media early on:Explosion at coply twitter.com/Boston_to_a_T/\u2026 \u2014 Boston to a T (@Boston_to_a_T) April 15, 2013And one more:Just heard that bombs went off at #boston marathon finish line twitter.com/chanyasulkit/s\u2026 \u2014 Chris Chanyasulkit (@chanyasulkit) April 15, 2013Here is perhaps the most shocking, dramatic, and up-close video from the bombings, via the Globe:Here is the moment of impact for the first of the two confirmed explosions, by way of Twitter's Vine, right near the sidewalk (scroll down for video of both):We're going to link to these next two shots (WARNING \u2014 they are graphic) since they show the chaos and some of the injuries, and there are a few very graphic images that have been uploaded to Reddit.NECN's Jackie Bruno reports that the injuries there are gruesome:I saw people's legs blown off.Horrific.Two explosions.Runners were coming in and saw unspeakable horror.\u2014 Jackie Bruno (@JackieBrunoNECN) April 15, 2013To be sure, this is a time to be good to each other.Because there are as many unconfirmed reports and speculative ideas (CBS News reported that certain terrorist target areas are being monitored in Boston, and the Secret Service set up a perimeter around the White House) as there are graphic images.There are amputations.Here are some of the first photos to hit the AP wire (WARNING \u2014 it is graphic):This photo from Reuters photographer John Tlumacki quickly became the iconic image of the day:Check out this Tumblr post where you can see Tlumacki taking the photo.And one more from The Boston Globe:boston marathon explosion twitter.com/GlobeDavidLRya\u2026 \u2014 David L. Ryan (@GlobeDavidLRyan) April 15, 2013Here are more photos from The Atlantic's In Focus blog.Here's video of the first explosion:And another close-up video from the explosion:Here's how a marathon runner saw things:And here's another angle with a second explosion in the distance.Here is the photo of Obama on the phone with FBI Director Robert Mueller (official White House photo by Pete Souza):Here is text of President Obama's full remarks at the White House.Adding further heartbreak to utter tragedy, the 26th mile marker in this year's marathon was actually dedicated to the victims of Newtown.The Eyewitness AccountsThe size of the crowd has yielded countless eyewitness accounts of the horrific scene.One of the more powerful ones we've read comes from The New York Times, which spoke to Rhode Island state trooper and former Marine Roupen Bastajian.\"These runners just finished and they don\u2019t have legs now,\" said Bastajian.\"So many of them.There are so many people without legs.It's all blood.There's blood everywhere.You got bones, fragments.It's disgusting.\"Several of those reporting on the explosions were actually runners in the marathon, so there is no shortage of eyewitness accounts.Two worth reading come from The Wall Street Journal reporter Coleen McCain Nelson and Boston Globe photographer John Tlumacki.Our own Richard Lawson, a Boston native, describes what the scene of the end of the marathon is like on a typical year:Marathon Monday is one of Boston's most celebratory days, with schools and offices closed and people lining the streets cheering runners on for essentially all 26.2 miles of a course which works its way further and further into town.By the time the Boston Marathon reaches the final stretch down narrow Boylston Street, it has entered the busy commercial district of Copley Square.The historic Boston Public Library is on the runners' right, ahead of them the open area of Copley Square Park and the famous Trinity Church.And of course the culmination of all that is the final downtown stretch, as spirited and jovial a scene as there is in Boston at any time throughout the year.The crowd on marathon day is dense and varied \u2014 locals and tourists and running enthusiasts from all over show up hours ahead to secure a good view of the finish line.And of course, there are the runners themselves, still streaming across the finish line for hours after the big winners are crowned.\u2014Richard LawsonAs the day wound down and everyone struggled to process what had happened, Astronaut Chris Hadfield sent a sympathetic dispatch from the International Space Station.\"A somber Spring night in Boston,\" he said, including this aerial photo of the city:Closer to home, some folks at MIT paid tribute to the patriotic spirit with an entire building:Stay tuned for the Wire's Day Two live blog and more at our Boston Marathon hub.Want to add to this story?Let us know in comments or send an email to the authors at , aabadsantos at theatlantic dot com or matt dot sullivan at theatlantic dot com.You can share ideas for stories on the Open Wire.Adam Clark EstesAlexander Abad-SantosMatt Sullivan", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombed <extra_id_0> Target Boston Marathon <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator Richard DesLauriers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant terrorist <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Target JFK Library <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator investigators <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact meet <extra_id_0> Participant Chuck Hagel <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim child <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator Richard DesLauriers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact confirmed <extra_id_0> Communicator Davis <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place event <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator Deval Patrick <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Davis <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator Davis <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient CNN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator CNN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient White House <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reporting <extra_id_0> Communicator CBS News <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Boston PD <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic video <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

This Sunday will be the 30th anniversary of Bloody Friday - when the IRA planted more than 20 bombs around Belfast.Twenty of them exploded, killing nine people and injuring more than 100 others.The people who died were both Catholics and Protestants - four bus drivers and two soldiers at a bus depot, two women and a 14-year-old boy at a row of shops.The victims came from all sections of the community.Why have the IRA released the statement now?The anniversary is one reason but the IRA is also trying to create a climate in which progress can be made.The statement also says the IRA remains totally committed to the peace process.We can also look back to 4 July when Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern met the pro-Good Friday Agreement parties at Hillsborough Castle.We heard a lot of talk that if paramilitaries on both sides did not show more commitment to the peace process the devolved government at Stormont could run into trouble.Finally, earlier this year, Republicans at an event in Dublin commemorated their dead and that was criticised in many quarters as glorifying what the IRA had done.I think all these reasons create the context in which the statement has been issued.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Contact apologises <extra_id_0> Participant non-combatants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact says <extra_id_0> Participant It <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths <extra_id_0> Victim non-combatants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact offers <extra_id_0> Participant families <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic condolences <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact apologised <extra_id_0> Participant IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack planted <extra_id_0> Attacker IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Belfast <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice Twenty <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact statement <extra_id_0> Topic IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact released <extra_id_0> Participant IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact met <extra_id_0> Participant parties <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Hillsborough Castle <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

It is frustrating to hide the facts,\" a senior interior ministry official in Kabul said.The complex attack on a highly secured base underlined the heavy pressure facing Afghan security forces as increasingly confident Taliban fighters have stepped up operations, even as diplomatic efforts to agree a peaceful settlement to the conflict have begun.Local officials said scores of troops and security personnel were killed in the attack. ( Tolo News via Storyful )Taliban insurgents, fighting to drive out international forces from Afghanistan and reintroduce their version of strict Islamic law, claimed responsibility for the attack, which spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said killed 190 people.The attack, the most serious against Afghan forces in months, occurred on the same day that Taliban representatives met Zalmay Khalilzad, the US special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, in Qatar.Last week, Taliban fighters set off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five people and wounding more than 110 in the capital Kabul, but casualties from Monday's attack appear to have been far higher.'Many more were killed'Sharif Hotak, a member of the provincial council in Maidan Wardak, said he saw the bodies of 35 members of the Afghan forces in the hospital.\"Many more were killed. Several bodies were transported to Kabul city and many injured were transferred to hospitals in Kabul,\" said Mr Hotak, adding that \"the Government was hiding the accurate casualty figures to prevent a further dip in morale of the Afghan forces.\"Monday's attack caused the biggest casualty total suffered by Afghan forces since August 2018, when the Taliban overran central Ghazni province.That confrontation killed 150 Afghan security forces and 95 civilians, as well as hundreds of Taliban fighters, officials said at the time.President Ashraf Ghani's office said in a statement the \"enemies of the country\" had carried out the attack and had killed and wounded \"a number of our beloved and honest sons\".In recent years the Afghan Government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures but US commanders have said repeatedly that the losses being suffered by Afghan forces are \"unsustainable\".Last year Mr Ghani said 28,000 Afghan police officers and soldiers had been killed since 2015.The British embassy in Afghanistan said Monday's casualties were \"a stark reminder of the sacrifice the Afghan security and defence forces make for their country\".Reuters", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize saw  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounding <extra_id_0> Victim 110 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injurer fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> Attacker fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place highly fortified compound <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target 110 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack confrontation  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place training centre <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

It was just completely flattened,\" she said.\"People just came from everywhere. They were on their hands and knees. They were passing the rubble one by one. They were in a big line.\"You heard them shouting: 'There's one, there's one'.\"It was just total chaos.

Why did my own people kill my mummy?\"At the back of your mind you knew it wasn't our own people that had done it.\"This was a family-run bar and it was people like my mummy and daddy that went to talk with each other and just pass the time of day for a pint or an orange and then come home again.\"Seven years after the bomb, a UVF man received 15 life sentences after he was convicted of the bombing.On Tuesday night a number of events are being held to mark the 30th anniverary of the atrocity.1900 GMT Mass at St Patrick's Chapel, Donegall Street.

On the afternoon of November 21, with emotions running high, all police leave was cancelled and an extra 1,300 officers were drafted in to guard his coffin as it was driven to Coventry airport and flown to Ireland.But hours after the funeral procession, two bombs exploded in two packed Birmingham city centre pubs.It has been claimed that a 'link man' ordered the revenge attacks in an impulsive grief-stricken reaction to McDade's death - without the blessing of IRA chiefs in Belfast. The secret figure, whose identity has never been revealed, is believed to have then left for Ireland to attend the funeral and has remained there ever since.Another theory is that the bombings were revenge attacks for the Loyalist Dublin and Monaghan bombings six months earlier.Thirty four people died in the Ulster Volunteer Force attacks, labelled the worst atrocity of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It has been claimed the British security forces colluded with the loyalist terrorists in the bombings.Mick Murray was one of three men arrested along with the Birmingham Six by West Midlands Police in the immediate aftermath of the pub blasts.It has been claimed that Murray, who died in 1999, helped choose the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town as targets.And he was named as being one of the bomb-makers who transported the explosives to the city centre before handing them to the men who planted them.But, it is claimed Murray then botched a telephone warning made to our sister newspaper The Birmingham Post. It was supposed to give half an hour for the pubs to be cleared. But his warning, using the codeword Double X, came just six minutes before the first explosion - and did not name either pub.Murray admitted being a member of the IRA after his arrest. But West Midlands Police never charged him with murder and he served 12 years in jail for conspiracy to cause explosions.In 1990 his name was mentioned in a report handed to the Government by the Who Bombed Birmingham? Granada TV programme.The show was based on a book by campaigning MP, Chris Mullin, who said he met the real bombers, but could not reveal their identity.In another Parliamentary report, the MP stated the programme-makers had also passed a Special Branch document containing details of interviews with an IRAman to the Home Office. The unnamed terrorist had been arrested in November 1975 - six months after the trial and conviction of the Birmingham Six.Mr Mullin claimed the terrorist gave police accurate information including the names of some of those whom he said were responsible for the bombs.Crucially, the papers contained the remark: 'So-and-so told me he put one of the bombs in the pub.'AlongwithMurrayand the Birmingham Six two other men - including James Kelly - were arrested in the immediate aftermath of the carnage.Kelly was found guilty of possessing explosives and bizarrely claimed he was a spy who infiltrated the IRA so he could later give help to the police.The Birmingham Six were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1975 for the pub bombings. They were all Belfast born but had lived in Brum since the 1960s.Five of them had left the city on the early evening of November 21 from New Street Station - hours before the explosions - to travel to Belfast to attend McDade's funeral. They were seen off by Callaghan.The five were arrested at Heysham that evening and Callaghan was taken into custody the next day.All the men were interrogated by Birmingham CID and claimed at trial they were beaten, threatened and forced to sign statements written by the police over three days of questioning.Their convictions were overturned by the Court of Appeal in March1991and their case is seen as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British legal history.Terrorist activity was rife in the Midlands during the 1970sand police arrested scores of IRA members in the months following the bombings.But the IRA unit which gained particular notoriety was the Birmingham Nine. They were responsible for 20 of the 31 bomb blasts in Birmingham and parts of the West Midlands between August 1973 and August 1974.Patrick Guilfoyle, Martin Coughlan, Gerard Young, Joseph Duffy, Michael Murray, Anthony Madigan, Joseph Ashe, Gerald Small and Stephen Blake conducted the biggest wave of bombings in the region since the Second World War.Coughlan and Young were said to be the leading figures in the campaign.Coughlan was born in Dublin and came to Birmingham in 1956. He rented a house in Chelmsley Wood with his wife and had three children.It is believed he was the brains behind the campaign of terror which began in Birmingham and spread to Manchester.Guilfoyle never quite made the grade of bomber. He caused an explosion that badly injured one of his IRA colleagues because he was smoking a cigarette while making a bomb.Northern Ireland historian David McVea said: 'Many different theories have been put forward as to who actually carried out the bombings, but it is unlikely that the true culprits will ever be identified.'The IRA was very protective of its members at the time, people moved in and out of the different cells constantly. 'As well as the killing of so many innocent people the real tragedy is the wrongful jailing of the Birmingham Six.'The IRA was able to use the injustice against these men to their advantage for years.'CAPTION(S):SLAUGHTERED: victims are taken away from the pub bombings; DEVASTATED: wreckage outside the Tavern in the Town; DEAD: James McDade; TRIBUTE: memorial to the victims", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Attacker Mick Murray <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target two pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham city <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain jailed <extra_id_0> Detainee The nine men <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant Birmingham Nine <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham city <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict served <extra_id_0> Prosecutor West Midlands Police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee terrorist <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict conviction <extra_id_0> Defendant Birmingham Six <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee James Kelly <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentenced <extra_id_0> Defendant Birmingham Six <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime interrogated <extra_id_0> Defendant men <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Investigator Birmingham CID <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Attacker Patrick Guilfoyle <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place region <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

He claimed the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, was \u201cbehind the attack\u201d, supported by a network of plotters and financiers based in Florida, adding that a group of hired assassins had already been captured.Maduro, whose country is in economic and political turmoil, with inflation predicted to reach 1m% this year, has long accused the international community of waging economic war on him. He regularly lambasts the US as \u201cimperialist\u201d and says it is out to destroy socialism while taking over Venezuela\u2019s oil \u2013 of which it has the largest reserves in the world.The opposition within Venezuela is also a regular target. Maduro claims it wants to undo the social reforms brought about by previous president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the charismatic revolutionary who died in 2013. Maduro has jailed and sidelined many opposition activists, regularly accusing them of plotting to overthrow him.It is this conspiracy that Maduro claims will be unearthed in an ongoing investigation.Rightwing rebelsNo one has claimed responsibility for the alleged assassination attempt outright, though one group \u2013 Soldiers Franelas \u2013 suggested involvement in a tweet. \u201cWe have shown [the government] is vulnerable,\u201d the group said. \u201c[The attack] wasn\u2019t achieved today but it is just a matter of time [until it is].\u201d Little is known about Soldiers Franelas beyond their Twitter presence, where the group regularly posts anti-Maduro tweets.La operaci\u00f3n era sobrevolar 2 drones cargados con C4 el objetivo el palco presidencial, francotiradores de la guardia de honor derribaron los drones antes de llegar al objetivo.Demostramos que son vulnerables, no se logr\u00f3 hoy pero es cuesti\u00f3n de tiempo. #MilitaresPatriotas pic.twitter.com/teIEwygN3S \u2014 Soldados de Franelas (@soldadoDfranela) August 4, 2018The episode on Saturday reminded many in Venezuela of a similar incident last year when \u00d3scar P\u00e9rez, a rogue police officer, launched grenades from a stolen helicopter at government buildings in Caracas. P\u00e9rez was killed in a shootout six months later. Some analysts suspect Soldiers Franelas of involvement in that incident.A hoaxSome observers are suspicious of Maduro\u2019s account of events, saying it seems a little too neat in a country where the government has long twisted the truth to its own ends.\u201cThe official \u2018investigation\u2019 of today\u2019s alleged assassination attempt against president Maduro takes the usual course: begin with the conclusions and work backwards,\u201d Phil Gunson, a consultant with non-profit Crisis Group, tweeted on Saturday evening. \u201cIn a country where 98% of crime goes unpunished, government sleuths resolve this kind of case in a matter of hours.\u201dHe will use it to concentrate power, whoever did this David SmildeFirefighters interviewed by the Associated Press claimed that the bangs heard were caused by a gas tank explosion in a nearby apartment. Some local journalists have backed up the claim, posting photos on Twitter of smoke billowing from the Residancias Don Eduardo apartment building on the street where the attack took place.David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America, voiced doubts that the incident was a staged attack. In an interview with AP, he claimed footage of the chaotic scenes at the parade \u2013 which for a short while were broadcast to the nation before being abruptly cut off \u2013 made Maduro look weak. But Smilde said the embattled president will still probably use the attack to cement his power.\u201cHe will use it to concentrate power, whoever did this,\u201d Smilde said. \u201cHe\u2019ll use it to further restrict liberty and purge the government and armed forces.\u201d", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime <extra_id_0> Place country <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flew <extra_id_0> Vehicle drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact speaking <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator the president <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain jailed <extra_id_0> Jailer Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee opposition activists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack launched <extra_id_0> Instrument grenades <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target government buildings <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker \u00d3scar P\u00e9rez <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim P\u00e9rez <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shootout  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact interviewed <extra_id_0> Participant Firefighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place Residancias Don Eduardo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place apartment <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

We hope that Colombia and the United States delivers those people under investigation that fled from Venezuela,\" Saab emphasized, explaining there are 15 prison warrants for suspects that left the country.On Aug. 4, 2018, an explosive-loaded drone detonated before reaching a stage where President Maduro was delivering a speech during a military parade in Caracas. At that time, the Venezuelan right-wing opposition and its allies, one of which was the U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton, said the explosion was \"a montage.\"Mainstream media immediately hopped on the bandwagon and dubbed the attack an \u201calleged\u201d attempt as well. However, six months after, CNN revealed unpublished images of how the attackers prepared on a Colombian farm, information which was provided by one of whom were involved.The Venezuelan conspirator also assured that U.S. government officials had three meetings with the plotters after the assassination attempt occurred.

{"text": "TORONTO (Reuters) - A homemade bomb set off last week by a Canadian man who was apparently inspired by Islamic State, failed to fully detonate, a senior police official told the National Post newspaper on Saturday.Slideshow ( 2 images )While there was a blast in the back seat of a taxi in Strathroy, Ontario, as police closed in, it came from the detonators, and explosive material did not go off, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) deputy commissioner Mike Cabana said.The RCMP could not immediately be reached for comment on the newspaper report.Aaron Driver, 24, was shot dead by police on Aug. 10 and the taxi company in the small town said the driver sustained only minor injuries in the blast.Cabana did not go into further detail on the bomb. He said forensic investigation was still underway. The target of what police have said was an attack plotted by Driver was unclear.Driver, who also used the alias Harun Abdurahman, was arrested last year for openly supporting Islamic State on social media, but was never charged with a crime. Islamic State militants control parts of Iraq and Syria and they have supporters and sympathizers around the world who have carried out attacks on civilians in several countries.In February, Driver was placed on a peace bond, a court order that restricted his movements. It required he stay away from social media and computers and not have contact with Islamic State or similar groups.The RCMP has said officers sought out Driver on Aug. 10 after a tip from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation that morning, which included a \u201cmartyrdom video.\u201dCabana said police identified Driver from the video in part through his choice of balaclava.The incident called into question Canada\u2019s capabilities to combat extremism and increased calls for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to abandon his plan to scale back a 2015 law that gave increased powers to police and intelligence agents.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack detonate <extra_id_0> Attacker who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast <extra_id_0> Target taxi <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Strathroy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim Aaron Driver <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Victim driver <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker Driver <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target target <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Harun Abdurahman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant Harun Abdurahman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place countries <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "US Charges Kyrgyzstan National with Hampering Boston Bombing ProbeBOSTON \u2014\u00a0U.S. officials on Friday charged a Kyrgyzstan national who bought dinner for the accused Boston Marathon bombers the night of the attack with interfering with the investigation into the deadly bombing.Khairullozhon Matanov, a 23-year-old taxi driver who lives in Quincy, Massachusetts, faces one criminal count of destroying records and three counts of lying to officials in a terrorism investigation, according to court papers filed in U.S. District Court in Boston.Brothers Tamerlan Tsarnaev, left, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are accused of carrying out the Boston Marathon bombing. Tamerlan was closely monitored while in Dagestan last year.Prosecutors said Matanov had been friends with accused bombers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, spoke with both in the days after the blast but lied to police about the extent of his relationship with the pair.Matanov, who had hiked a New Hampshire mountain with Tamerlan Tsarnaev to \u201ctrain like, and praise, the 'mujahideen,\u201d' according to court papers, deleted searches related to the attacks from his computer, tried to dispose of cell phones he had used to contact the brothers, and denied knowing much about the pair in interviews with police.Matanov was not accused of playing a role in the April 15, 2013, bombing, which killed three people and injured 264. The Tsarnaev brothers have also been accused of shooting dead a police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology three days after the attack as they tried to flee Boston.Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died after a shootout with police following that incident, while Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was apprehended early the next evening. The surviving brother, now 20, is awaiting trial and faces the possibility of execution if convicted.Matanov told an unidentified witness cooperating with the government that \u201cthe bombings could have had a just reason, such as being done in the name of Islam, that he would support the bombings if the reason were just or the attack had been done by the Taliban, and that the victims had gone to paradise,\u201d according to the papers.Matanov was arrested early Friday by members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force at his home in Quincy. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of destroying evidence and eight years for each false statement count.He is the fourth person to face criminal charges for interfering with the investigation into the largest mass-casualty attack on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.The others are three college friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev: Kazakhstan exchange students Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, as well as Robel Phillipos of Cambridge. Prosecutors contended that after the FBI released photos of the suspected bombers, the three men realized the suspects' identities and removed a laptop and backpack containing empty fireworks shells from Dzhokhar's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant national <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Defendant Tamerlan Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 264 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Defendant brothers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer brothers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Matanov <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges <extra_id_0> Defendant He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
