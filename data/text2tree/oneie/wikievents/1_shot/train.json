Taken as a whole, the evidence suggests that the plan to bomb the Boston Marathon took shape over three months.A key issue for jurors \u2014 both in the guilt phase and later in the penalty phase if Tsarnaev is convicted \u2014 will be whether the jurors see Tsarnaev as an equal partner with his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, in the Boston Marathon bombing and the violent events that followed.As of Tuesday morning, jurors began reviewing evidence and witness testimony, which will play a role in helping them decide Dzhokhar Tsarnaev\u2019s guilt on each of the 30 charges he faces.AdvertisementJanuary 2013Tsarnaev, then 19, talks to his close friend, Stephen Silva, about borrowing Silva\u2019s 9mm P95 Ruger semi-automatic pistol.

{"text": "Indonesian Police Receive Terrorist Threat Targeting BaliJAKARTA \u2014\u00a0In Indonesia there are growing concerns that more deadly attacks could follow last week\u2019 bombings in Jakarta by Islamist militants.Bali police Tuesday say they received an anonymous letter warning that the resort Island will be the next target for a terrorist assault.\"The letter was sent by an anonymous individual to Buleleng district, and the police are still conducting an investigation, and trying to find out who sent the letter. But again, I urge people in Bali not to be afraid, but they should stay alert,\" said Bali Police Chief Sugeng Priyanto.Authorities say they've increased security at shopping malls and other locations that draw crowds in Bali.In 2002, the popular resort island was targeted by Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), an Indonesia-based terrorist group with links to al-Qaida. The bombing of a club in Bali killed 202 people, mostly foreigners.The Bali bombing severely hurt Indonesia\u2019s tourism industry, and began a decade of deadly plots in Indonesia carried out by Southeast Asian militants affiliated with al-Qaida.Indonesia successfully combated the JI related terrorist threat through police action, intelligence operations and high profile criminal prosecutions.However, after last week's attack in the center of Jakarta that killed eight people, including four militants, Indonesian security forces are raising concerns that more and deadlier attacks could follow, carried out by groups inspired by Islamic State.Indonesian Special Police patrol at Ngurah Rai Airport in Denpasar on Indonesia's resort island of Bali on Jan. 15, 2016, one day after a series of explosions hit the Indonesian capital Jakarta.The Jakarta attack was the first of its kind in Southeast Asia to be attributed to Syria-based militant Islamists.Authorities say about 500 Indonesians have travelled to the Middle East to join the extremist group. About 100 are believed to have returned, although experts say only about 15 have combat experience.Jakarta back to normalSo far the renewed threat of terrorism has not instilled any widespread sense of panic or fear amongst Indonesians.A security personnel stand guard inside train carriage for women at Manggarai train station in Jakarta, Jan. 8, 2016.Life in Jakarta has quickly returned to normal, less than a week after the deadly attacks.On Tuesday the Starbucks coffee shop that was bombed remained closed and boarded up for repairs, but the memorial of flowers had been removed. Other shops have reopened and traffic at the busy intersection was congested as usual.'Ojek' heroThe \u201cojek\u201d motorcycle taxi drivers were again gathered at the intersection where the attack took place, waiting for their next fares.One of the \u201cojek\u201d drivers back at work is Muhamad Yunus, who has received widespread praise for the selfless courage he exhibited during the attack.The militant attackers last Thursday (January 14) set off two bombs, the first at the Starbucks and the second at a police traffic station in the middle of the intersection, near Jakarta's oldest department store, Sarinah.After the second explosion Yunus rushed to the police station to help the wounded even though the assailants were shooting at anyone in the area. He said he found a woman whose legs were severely injured and brought her to safety, away from the firefight.\u201cI got that woman and I told her, don\u2019t cry. Please be strong. Be strong. Please don\u2019t be sad,\u201d Yunus said.Yunus said he found out later that the woman and her nephew were stopped by the police for a traffic violation at the time of the blast. Her nephew died in the explosion.Kami tidak takutAfter the Jakarta attack there have been demonstrations by Indonesian Muslims to denounce terrorism and call for the government to eradicate radical militants and supporters of Islamic State in the country.A \"Pray for Jakarta\" message (top) is displayed on a screen as Indonesians gather outside the damaged Starbucks coffee shop in central Jakarta on Jan. 17, 2016 following the deadly gun and bomb attacks that rocked the city on Jan. 14.Indonesians also have started to use hashtags like \"PrayforJakarta\" and \"Kamitidaktakut\" or \"Wearenotafraid\" in English, on social media.Yunus\u2019s act of heroism has been held up as an example of Indonesia\u2019s resolve to stand up against terrorism.\u201cI am not afraid. We won\u2019t be scared any more,\u201d he said.Dismantling terror networksMeanwhile Indonesian authorities have promised to intensify their efforts to monitor radical networks in the country.Police believe the alleged mastermind of the Jakarta attack, an Indonesian fighting with Islamic State in Syria called Bahrun Naim, used social media to communicate his radical ideas to followers in Indonesia.In December police say they successfully disrupted plans by militants to launch a string of deadly attacks on Christmas and New Year celebrations, as well as against the country's Shia Muslim minority.Prior to last week, the last major attack in the world's most populous Muslim nation was the twin bombing of luxury hotels in Jakarta in 2009.Ade Irma in Jakarta contributed to this

{"text": "To live in Ciudad Guayana is to know state-owned enterprise workers \u2014lots of them. With all the nationalized \u201cbasic industries\u201d around here, they\u2019re a normal part of daily life. So I called around some of the ones I know to ask about today\u2019s vote. The stories I heard were\u2026 remarkably similar.Jos\u00e9 at FerromineraAt Ferrominera, the big mining company in Guayana, workers are being forced to vote for the Constituent Assembly. The deal is simple: vote or you\u2019re fired. At each department, the manager is responsible for making sure his people vote.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get fired,\u201d he says. \u201cMy daughter is in the hospital.\u201dThere\u2019s nothing subtle about it. The order comes face-to-face, in notices and even via text message. Employees must go to meetings where the order is to vote. Nobody cares who they vote for \u2014this is a single party election, man. Managers are required to make lists with the ID numbers of the employees voting, and send them to human resources by Monday.Jos\u00e9 \u2014not his real name\u2014 has worked at Ferrominera for 15 years. \u201cThey make everyone vote, especially those in higher positions.\u201dJos\u00e9 isn\u2019t voting, though. He\u2019s not wealthy and he doesn\u2019t have a plan B if they fire him, but he\u2019s taking the chance.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get fired,\u201d he says. \u201cMy daughter is in the hospital, I guess my wife and I will go with her. I don\u2019t know.\u201dIn his office, where barely ten people work, everyone has agreed to boycott the election. But, he adds, many others are compelled out of fear.Maria\u2019s mom at PDVSAMartha \u2014like all names, changed for this story\u2014 wouldn\u2019t talk to me. I had to approach her daughter Mar\u00eda instead. She talked to me in secret, without telling her mom. \u201cI know her, there\u2019s no way she\u2019ll agree to an interview. She\u2019s too scared\u201d.She must report to her boss the exact voting center she went to, and the time she went at.Martha didn\u2019t go to the vote drill. Her boss harassed her and the other employees with constant texts, but there was only one voting center in Ciudad Guayana, and it was too far to consider it.For the real thing, the pressure is absurd. She must report to her boss the exact voting center she went to, and the time she went at. Martha will try a null vote. She\u2019s been in PDVSA for more than 20 years.Betania\u2019s dad at VenalumBetania\u2019s dad wouldn\u2019t talk to me (see a pattern?), but his daughter, an old friend, told me what he told the family. Her dad has been working for the big aluminum-maker way before chavismo was a thing: 25 years total.I just wish they burn all of the voting machines, so no one can vote. I hate this fucking government with all my soul.On Sunday, workers are being told to go to the plant first thing. They\u2019ll be put on buses to the voting centers. Managers are responsible for making sure the workers participate, and have lists saying where each worker votes. They must show up in the company\u2019s uniform too \u2014for the picture.Betania\u2019s dad is determined to vote. He has to protect his job; he\u2019s about to retire, he won\u2019t risk it. His family thinks he should stay home today. \u201cHere, they\u2019ll block the road at 5 am\u201d Betania tells me, \u201cso he might not be able to leave. We want him to stay, something might happen on the way there.\u201dShe catches her thoughts.\u201cI just wish they burn all of the voting machines, so no one can vote. I hate this fucking government with all my soul.\u201dJorge in the ArmyMilitary officers are forced to vote, just like any other state worker. As soldiers, they have to follow orders, or face trial by insubordination.I wish I could reveal more about my guy, but he wouldn\u2019t let me. He\u2019s a military officer and it\u2019s from el interior. He doesn\u2019t want to vote, and his plan is to show up, say hi and walk out. By showing himself, he thinks, he\u2019ll be off the hook.I reached out to people at two other state companies, but they refused to talk, even after I offered to change their names. The fear of dismissal makes getting the stories extremely hard, and look at the pattern I discovered: threats are explicit, demands are crystal clear and the workers? Extremely resentful of the position they\u2019ve been put in.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle burn <extra_id_0> Artifact machines <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destroyer they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle burn <extra_id_0> Artifact machines <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destroyer they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact called <extra_id_0> Participant some <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand forced <extra_id_0> Recipient workers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Guayana <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand making sure <extra_id_0> Recipient his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator manager <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand order  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand order <extra_id_0> Recipient Employees <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand required <extra_id_0> Recipient Managers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand make <extra_id_0> Communicator They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient everyone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce compelled <extra_id_0> Recipient others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact approach <extra_id_0> Participant Mar\u00eda <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact talked <extra_id_0> Participant me <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact report <extra_id_0> Participant her <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic voting center <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce harassed <extra_id_0> Communicator Her <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient employees <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact report <extra_id_0> Participant her <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic voting center <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant family <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant me <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand told <extra_id_0> Recipient workers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation put <extra_id_0> Vehicle buses <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination centers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand making sure <extra_id_0> Communicator Managers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient workers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce forced <extra_id_0> Recipient officers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce orders <extra_id_0> Recipient they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reached out <extra_id_0> Participant I <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> EndPosition fire <extra_id_0> Employee him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Pressure Cookers, Nails, BBs, and Bags: What We Know About the Boston BombsMore StoriesThe 140-Year-Old Dream of \u2018Government Without Taxation\u2019The Media Barely Covered One of the Worst Storms to Hit U.S. SoilFrance\u2019s Jews Look to Pittsburgh \u2018Across a Narrow Bridge\u2019There were only two bombsIn the hours following the explosions, an array of outlets \u2014 including the Associated Press,TheWall Street Journal, andThe New York Times\u2014 quoted anonymous law enforcement officials who said that police had discovered three and even five additional, unexploded devices around the Boston area.The reports emerged around the same time that, as first reported byThe Boston Globe, a bomb squad arranged and detonated a \"controlled explosion\" on Boylston Street, just east of the first two explosions, in order to destroy a cache of \"suspicious packages\" that officials had come across.A similar scene played out in the Boston suburb of Newton, where a bomb squad used a robot to investigate a suspicious object that turned to be a circuit board.Monday night, theJournalquoted law enforcement officials as saying there had been five devices, then updated its report to clarify that \"investigators now doubt the devices were bombs.\"But during Tuesday morning's press conference, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick announced that law enforcement agents had not in fact discovered any other bombs.\"It's important to clarify that two and only two explosive devices were found yesterday.Other parcels have been examined ... but there were no unexploded bombs,\" he told reporters.The bombs may have been based in pressure cookersA representative of Boston Children's Hospital said at Tuesday afternoon press briefing that children being treated for injuries \"had BBs and nails embedded in their bodies,\" which were presumably packed into or around the bombs in order to maximize damage.(Massachusetts Congressman Stephen Lynch, reiterating what doctors at multiple hospitals had reported at briefings of their own Monday night, told Yahoo News that many victims were struck by what appeared to be metal ball bearings.)The exact design of the bombs, of course, remains unclear.Citing an unnamed source familiar with the investigation, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday morning that investigators, upon recovering pieces of the exploded bombs, determined that they were made of 6-liter pressure cookers, which were packed with ball bearings and metal nails and stuffed into \"black duffel bags.\"(CNN described them as \"backpacks\".)On Tuesday afternoon this information was reported by multiple outlets speaking to sources with knowledge of the Boston investigation.This is what your average pressure cooker looks like:It's a metal container used to quickly cook food using trapped steam.(The cooker's contents are heated using a stove or a built-in heating element, in the case of electric models.)You can buy one pretty much anywhere.For these reasons it makes an attractive container (to terrible, violent people) for holding, transporting, and detonating explosive materials.\"Terrorists use pressure cookers as IED containers for 2 main reasons,\" Israeli journalist Elizabeth Tsurkov explained via Twitter on Tuesday afternoon.\"The pressure cooker increases the pressure of the explosion gasses [and] and because the metal casings becomes deadly fragmentation upon detonation.\"Indeed, there's a long history of terrorists employing pressure cookers abroad.On Tuesday morningTime's Michael Crowley surfaced a 2004 memo issued by the Department of Homeland Security, cataloging episodes in which Afghan terrorists used pressure cookers to fabricate explosive devices and detonated them in several countries throughout the 2000s.(Such contraptions are especially prevalent in contested regions of Pakistan.)American soil is no stranger to these contraptions, either.The foiled terrorist plot to detonate a bomb in Times Square on May 1, 2010, involved a pressure cooker.Indeed, nobody in law enforcement or government is making any public connections to any groups or places right now.A Saudi man reported to be a \"person of interest\" has been cleared as a suspect.As President Obama said at the White House Tuesday: \"What we don't yet know, however, is who carried out this attack, or why; whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic, or was the act of a malevolent individual.That's what we don't yet know.And clearly, we're at the beginning of our investigation.\"In a post expanding on the memo,Time's Crowley noted the ease of creating such an explosive device.\"The ability to make these bombs is hardly unique to al Qaeda and its sympathizers.Details on how to make a pressure cooker bomb can also be found on websites associated with anarchy and other forms of non-religious radicalism,\" he said, before linking to such a website.Other evidence suggests that the bombs were made with readily-available chemicals.New Scientistasked a bomb expert to study the footage of the explosion for clues of the bombs origin.Here's what the expert concluded: \"The Boston bombs ... produced an orange flash followed by white smoke.This suggests the bombs contained neither TNT nor RDX, which produce black smoke, but could have been a home-made chlorate-based device.\"Update, 5:04 p.m.:ABC News is reporting that one of the bombs used gunpowder to detonate.It's unclear how the bombs detonatedIn the same report detailing how the bombs were built, the Associated Press notes, \"law enforcement officials have some of the bomb components but [do] not yet know what was used to set off the explosives.\"In that vacuum of knowledge a number of rumors have appeared: 1) the bombs used a timer; 2) the bombs were activated remotely; 3) cell phone service was shut down in downtown Boston to avert other remotely-activated bombs; and 4) a mysterious roof-top figure captured in a single photo hassomethingto do with setting off the bomb.Rumor No.1 appears to be the strongest.After speaking to an official close to the investigation, CNN knocked down rumors (discussed below) that the bomb had been detonated using a cell phone-activated trigger, and reported that investigators in Boston think the bombs had timers attached to them instead.And, within minutes of CNN's report, theGlobereported that investigators had turned up a circuit board they believe was used to trigger the explosions; it was reportedly found near a spot where Gov.Patrick had been seated earlier in the day.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack explosions  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection discovered <extra_id_0> Observer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity devices <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> Place Boylston Street <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker squad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle destroy <extra_id_0> Place Boylston Street <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destroyer squad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact cache <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection investigate <extra_id_0> Instrument a robot <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity a circuit board <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Observer squad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize investigate <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject object <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifiedRole a circuit board <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Identifier squad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact announced <extra_id_0> Communicator Deval Patrick <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic any other bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place press conference <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact saying <extra_id_0> Topic devices <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection examined  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Intervention treated <extra_id_0> Patient children <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Treater Boston Children's Hospital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator representative <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic children <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Communicator Stephen Lynch <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Yahoo News <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic bearings <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble made <extra_id_0> Artifact the exploded bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components metal nails <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize cataloging <extra_id_0> Identifier Department of Homeland Security <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble fabricate <extra_id_0> Artifact explosive devices <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components pressure cookers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler terrorists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice them <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker terrorists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place countries <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonate <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Times Square <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker terrorist <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Acquit cleared <extra_id_0> Defendant man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator our <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble made <extra_id_0> Artifact the bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components readily-available chemicals <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime study <extra_id_0> Investigator expert <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonate <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice the bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble built <extra_id_0> Artifact the bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack trigger <extra_id_0> Instrument circuit board <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Latest news straight to your inbox Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Invalid EmailThe second Birmingham pub bombings pre-inquest review takes place this week. Andy Richards reveals for the first time the tragic story of young victim Marilyn Paula Nash.An early riser for work, council worker John Smith needed to be on autopilot as he set off as usual on the grey, dismal Friday morning that is forever etched in his memory.Normally, he would have had a spring in his step. After all, all the weekend was beckoning. It was a chance for him to unwind from the office graft, and perhaps enjoy a drink or two.But this wasn\u2019t a normal morning. In fact, there had never been another morning quite like it in the West Midlands.The previous night, well, at that stage all the terrible details were not known. Accounts varied, the death toll was rising.Bombers \u2013 everyone knew they were the IRA, although the terror group had not claimed responsibility \u2013 had destroyed two pubs in Birmingham city centre.Nineteen people were dead, several were clinging to life, two of whom would eventually succumb to dreadful injuries.The number of injured seemed to change with almost every news bulletin, but it was steadily increasing, and by now it was more than 150.On the previous night \u2013 November 21, 1974 \u2013 families across the UK had clustered around TV sets and radios, utterly aghast and trying to take in what the news flashes from Birmingham were showing and describing.In the city, and across the Black Country towns of West Bromwich, Dudley, Walsall and Wolverhampton, fear of more attacks, combined with growing anger, was visceral.There had already been a number of reprisal attacks on Irish homes and businesses. The region bristled with tension.John\u2019s head was already full of this as he fastened his coat to leave his Walsall home. Little did he know that the sickening horror of the previous night was on his own doorstep.He stepped out... and into a nightmare scenario.John, now a 74-year-old pensioner and still living in the same terraced property, knows the memories can never be erased.\u201cIt must have been about 7am,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had all heard about the bombs going off in the pubs in Birmingham the night before. The whole area was in shock, people could hardly believe it.\u201dIn his early 30s at the time, on that Friday morning he was intent on catching his usual bus for the daily journey to work at Lichfield Council where he was involved in planning sewerage pipe developments.As he set off from the small close in Pelsall where his family lived, he was confronted by the extraordinary sight of his neighbour, Mr Nash stumbling about in the road \u201clike a lost man\u201d.John remembers his neighbour\u2019s tears and his face \u2013 the face of a man in absolute torment.\u201cHe was simply wandering about, not going anywhere but obviously really upset,\u201d recalls John. \u201cSo naturally I went to him and asked him what was wrong.\u201cHe said his daughter, Marilyn, had been in Birmingham the night before. She still hadn\u2019t come home.\u201dMr Nash was a widower and lived with Marilyn, who was 22, and his son, Robert, in the terraced house next door. John thinks Robert was away studying at university at the time. Either way, there was no-one else at home.With nobody to talk to, Mr Nash\u2019s agony had multiplied with each long hour throughout the blackest of nights.\u201cI tried to comfort him as best I could, but what can you do? What can you say?,\u201d says John. \u201cHis daughter should have been home hours ago. There had been no sign or word of her.\u201cI persuaded him to come back to our house where I left him with my mother before I went on to work. She did her best to help him.\u201dWhatever conversation passed between John\u2019s mother and Mr Nash is not known. Neither is how long the poor man waited for news.But his fears for his daughter were sadly well-founded. She never did come home.It took the authorities some time to confirm that Birmingham shop worker Marilyn Paula Nash \u2013 known as Paula to her family and close friends \u2013 was among the dead.She was an attractive, vivacious young woman, with a hint of Jackie Onassis about her looks and hairstyle.Those tasked with the dreadful job of identifying the dead could only confirm it was her by her wage packet, says John.\u201cI remember that she was a very sweet, very friendly girl,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe was my next door neighbour and a reasonably similar age so, although were were not close, we would always say hello, and pass the time of day. Sometimes we would catch the same bus if we were going into Birmingham for a drink, and we would chat.\u201dA fateful decision by Marilyn to pop into a pub for a quick drink on the way home from work cost her her life.It was the penultimate pay day before Christmas. The pubs in Birmingham were full and business was brisk. Marilyn headed for the Tavern In The Town, the underground bar in New Street which had become a cult drinking hole for students and young workers.So did the bombers. They wrought carnage there, and at the nearby Mulberry Bush at the bottom of The Rotunda.\u201cWhen it became known that Marilyn was among the dead, this whole area was in absolute shock,\u201d remembers John. \u201cThere was a big Irish community locally and a local Catholic club was nearby.\u201cI remember the police ordering the Catholic club to be closed for security reasons for a time. I don\u2019t think that was necessary, but I suppose they feared reprisals or trouble and had to be careful.\u201dMr Nash, who later remarried, is understood to have passed away many years ago, and Marilyn\u2019s brother is believed to live in another part of the country.John is probably the only resident from those days still living in the small, tidy street that witnessed such awful events.The homes there are well-kept but nowadays many have signs in their windows making it clear that callers without appointments are not welcome.It suggests the residents prefer keep themselves to themselves.Most probably have no idea of the tragedy that visited the Nash family 42 years ago.(Image: Wesley/Keystone/Getty Images)As for John, his chat with me has clearly stirred recollections that have lay dormant for many years.But he is not optimistic that the new inquest will bring truth or closure to those who still grieve.\u201cLike a good many others I would like to know what really went on that night but...\u201d and here he pauses.\u201cIt may turn something up, but those who did it have got away with it for too long.\u201dEx-IRA chief: Pub attacks left me ashamed and appalled...(Image: Birmingham Mail)The IRA\u2019s involvement in the bombings became clearer with the publication of the memoirs of Kieran Conway, head of the its intelligence-gathering department during the 1970s.In his book Southside Provisional, he confessed that the attacks on the pubs left him \u201cashamed and appalled.\u201dThe attacks on the Birmingham pubs, neither of which had any military connection, \u201cwent against everything we claimed to stand for,\u201d he said.The bombings came after police disrupted the funeral arrangements for James McDade, a lieutenant in the Birmingham Brigade of the IRA who blew himself up while trying to attack Coventry Telephone Exchange a few days earlier.\u201cTempers were high and I, for one, certainly at first feared that the local IRA had knowingly caused these dreadful casualties,\u201d said Conway.He claimed the IRA unit responsible \u201ccould not find a functioning telephone box, so they were unable to issue a warning sufficiently in time to clear the bars and prevent the mass loss of life.\u201dConway finally left the Republican movement in 1993 and is now a criminal lawyer in Dublin.Fighting families\u2019 legal aid problems still to be resolvedRelatives of more than half the victims are hoping to be represented by lawyers at the pre-inquest review hearing on Thursday.But at the time of going to press, longstanding issues of legal aid had still to be resolved.For several months the Government had insisted that KRW Law, the Belfast-based law firm representing most of the families, was not eligible for legal aid.But at the end of last month, there was a U-turn and the Legal Aid Agency is currently considering a fresh application.Legal Aid Minister Sir Oliver Heald QC said: \u201cIt would be a travesty for families to be denied justice simply because of a technicality, which is why I have taken the decision to change the regulations around inquest funding. This will remove any barrier from the families\u2019 solicitors in applying for legal aid funding for the inquest.\u201dThe inquest was re-opened in June last year following a campaign by the families, backed by the Birmingham Mail. The full inquest is expected to take place in September.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Target pub <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack destroyed <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Bombers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure were <extra_id_0> Victim several <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die injuries <extra_id_0> Victim two <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Infect injured <extra_id_0> Victim 150 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target homes <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack going off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim Marilyn Paula Nash <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact says <extra_id_0> Participant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact asked <extra_id_0> Participant I <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact says <extra_id_0> Participant John <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact persuaded <extra_id_0> Participant him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact recalls <extra_id_0> Participant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact says <extra_id_0> Participant John <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact remembers <extra_id_0> Participant John <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact chat <extra_id_0> Participant me <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target Pub <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack came  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew <extra_id_0> Attacker James McDade <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Coventry Telephone Exchange <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Conway <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> StartPosition is <extra_id_0> Employee Conway <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PlaceOfEmployment Dublin <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Oliver Heald QC <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "LISTEN TO ARTICLE 5:16 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post EmailThis past April, a number of Venezuelan military dissidents were holed up in neighboring Colombia plotting to overthrow the government of President Nicolas Maduro when they were approached by a group with similar plans.The second group, mostly civilians, wanted to assassinate Maduro and suggested joining forces. They showed videos of armed drones shipped from Miami and being tested on a Colombian farm.Maduro attends a ceremony prior to explosion on Aug. 4. Photographer: Juan Barreto/AFP via Getty ImagesThe military dissidents declined to participate. They found the civilians unprofessional and weren\u2019t interested in killing Maduro. Their goal was to capture him and put him on trial.Two weeks ago, when Maduro was speaking at a military parade in Caracas, drones packed with plastic explosives detonated nearby in a failed assassination attempt. A participant in the April Bogota meeting said in an interview that he believes the people his group met with were the perpetrators.InfiltratedHis group, which included members of all four armed-service branches, was later infiltrated by the Venezuelan security services. Several dozen were arrested, breaking up the most serious attempt to overthrow Maduro in his five years in office. The plan was called Operation Constitution. The man remains abroad.His theory about who was behind the drone attack is one of several clues emerging about the perpetrators of the Aug. 4 assault.The government also knows some things about the plotters. It says their financier is Osman Delgado, a Venezuelan living in Miami who is linked to a 2017 attack on a military base. Delgado couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.The government has released audio recordings of what seem to be the attackers on the day of the assassination attempt. The recordings reveal a chaotic group bickering and scolding one another for failing to report in or not speaking loudly enough or announcing that the military ceremony being attacked was underway.Security forces check a building after an explosion during the ceremony on Aug. 4. Photographer: Juan Barreto/AFP via Getty Images\u201cSay Something!\u201dAt one point, one of the alleged conspirators can be heard giving a series of instructions on how to operate the drone. Later, another demands the status of the rest of the group after one drone is airborne. \u201cUpdates please. Say something! Everything is quiet!\u201d she is heard to say.The government appears to be using the plot to pursue political opponents who may have nothing to do with it, an approach it has used in the past. It has at times arrested opponents and accused them of sabotage as the economy and basic services have collapsed. In the past, the plots were mostly invented for political purposes; now they\u2019re increasingly real.In the past two weeks, the government has announced the arrests of two high-ranking national guardsmen, a congressman and almost a dozen other people, many younger than 30.The Venezuelan Justice Organization, a human-rights watchdog, says there are currently about 150 servicemen and women behind bars.Soldiers in T-ShirtsOne group claiming responsibility for this month\u2019s attempt is a network of online activists called Soldados de Franela, or Soldiers in T-Shirts, named after the way street protesters hide their faces. The escaped plotter, however, doesn\u2019t think they are the people he met with in Bogota.What is clear is the depth of despair spreading across Venezuela as it descends into a lawless failed state where crime is rampant, those who can are leaving and hunger gnaws away at many of the nation\u2019s remaining 30 million inhabitants. For at least a year, there have been multiple small-scale rebellions, largely unconnected.Officials say as many 34 people, including opposition leaders and former student protesters, conspired in the drone attack. The president was unharmed, but much of the country watched on live television as hundreds of soldiers scattered following the off-camera explosions, deeply embarrassing the government.Juan Requesens Source: AFP TV/AFP via Getty ImagesAmong the detainees are a general and colonel of the national guard and the congressmen, Juan Requesens. He has been charged with attempted homicide and treason. The government has released a video of Requesens, 29, that shows him apparently answering an interrogator and acknowledging participating in the plot. His party says he was coerced and drugged. Another video his supporters leaked shows him in a state of ruin, almost naked in what appears to be soiled underwear.20 More SuspectsAuthorities are now seeking an additional 20 suspects, including a lawmaker in exile, who are at large across Latin America and in the U.S.The government has named as one of the leaders Julio Borges, the former head of Venezuela\u2019s opposition-led congress, who fled to Colombia earlier this year. Borges has denied involvement and said the attacks were perpetrated from within the government\u2019s own ranks.Soldiers in T-Shirts formed following a wave of anti-government unrest in 2014. Its website and social-media accounts have been popular among demonstrators and resistance groups for updates on protests and news critical of the government.In 2017, Soldiers in T-Shirts began disseminating messages and videos of Oscar Perez, an elite police officer who commandeered a helicopter and called upon Venezuelans to rise up against the government. Security forces killed him in January in an hours-long shootout that was, in part, broadcast across social media.One of the Soldiers in T-Shirts leaders, who gave his name as Gregory, confirmed Perez\u2019s death the day of the raid in an interview with CNN en Espanol. Whatever their role in the most recent attack, he said, the group is growing.\u201cThis is not a defeat,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government wants to view it as a trophy, but there are more of us.

{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Two drones packed with explosives reportedly flew toward Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Saturday night in what the government has described as a failed assassination attempt.Here's a look at the details:What happened?Assailants launched two drones filled with a total of more than 4 pounds of plastic explosives toward Maduro, his wife and other top Venezuelan leaders, according to the Associated Press.The attack occurred while Maduro was making a speech at a huge outdoor event in Caracas to celebrate the 81st anniversary of the country's national guard. One of the drones was set to explode above the president while the second was set to detonate in front of him, according to Interior Minister Nestor Reverol.The Venezuelan military knocked one of the drones off-course electronically. The second drone crashed into an apartment building about two blocks from where Maduro was speaking to hundreds of troops, Reverol said.Photos taken at the event showed security officers surrounding Maduro with some sort of large black shields as they escorted him away.\"That drone came after me,\" Maduro said. \"But there was a shield of love that always protects us. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll live for many more years.\"Who launched the drone attack?The Venezuelan government alleges that Maduro's political opponents conspired with individuals in Miami and Bogota, Colombia, to try to kill Maduro. They have so far offered no real proof to support this claim, and opposition leaders charge that Maduro is using the attack as an excuse to crack down on his critics.Government authorities said Sunday that they have detained six people \u2013 whom they described as \"terrorists and assassins\" \u2013 in connection with the attack. Among those detained: a man who took part in 2014 protests against the government and a man who had a warrant out for his arrest for attacking a military barracks.Maduro accused the \u201cfar right,\u201d working with conspirators in Miami and Bogota \u2013including Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos \u2013 of launching the attack. Colombia\u2019s government has denied any role in the violence.Maduro, who accuses the U.S. of supporting his opponents, called on President Donald Trump to hold the \"terrorist group\" accountable.John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, said Sunday he would like to see solid evidence to support Maduro's claims.\"If the government of Venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of U.S. criminal law, we\u2019ll take a serious look at it,\" Bolton said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"What is the political and economic situation in Venezuela?Venezuela is in the midst of an economic crisis that has been described as worse than the Great Depression that devastated the United States and much of the rest of the world in the 1930s.The inflation rate is set to hit a stunning 13,000 percent this year. There are shortages of food and medicine and a soaring crime rate, spurring refugees to flee into neighboring countries. More than 600,000 Venezuelans have crossed into Colombia, and Brazil has declared a state of emergency because of all the Venezuelans sweeping into that nation.Maduro is viewed by the United States and other democratic countries as a corrupt, left-wing dictator who imposes strict controls on his people and on the press. He won re-election to a six-year term in May, but the process was widely viewed as a rigged farce.The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Venezuela immediately after the election in an effort to stop Maduro from selling off government debt to enrich himself.What could happen next?Reverol said there could be more arrests. Critics fear an even greater government crackdown on Maduro's political opponents.\"The investigation will get to the bottom of this,\" Maduro said. \"No matter who falls.\"More:Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says drone attack was 'attempt to kill me'More:Venezuelan opposition leaders taken from their homes by state security agents", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Crash crashed <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> CrashObject building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flew <extra_id_0> Vehicle drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation launched <extra_id_0> Transporter Assailants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact speech <extra_id_0> Communicator Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation escorted <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transporter they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack kill <extra_id_0> Target Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain detained <extra_id_0> Jailer authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee whom <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protests <extra_id_0> Topic the government <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrator who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacking <extra_id_0> Attacker who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target barracks <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassination  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand called <extra_id_0> Recipient Donald Trump <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flee <extra_id_0> Destination countries <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact refugees <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation crossed <extra_id_0> Destination Colombia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack kill <extra_id_0> Target me <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain taken <extra_id_0> Detainee opposition leaders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer state <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Mariana Zu\u00f1igaSpecial for USA TODAYCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Venezuelan election officials said 8 million people voted Sunday to create a constitutional assembly endowing President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro with virtually unlimited powers, a vote total decried by domestic and foreign critics as a sham.Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council's estimated turnout Sunday was more than double that of political opponents and independent experts.Opposition leaders also said 12 people were killed in violence in the face of a massive presence of troops around the country on Sunday. The government confirmed nine deaths.Maduro, who faces a worsening economic crisis despite Venezuela's enormous oil reserves, seeks to establish a friendly assembly that would bypass the opposition-controlled Congress to rewrite the country\u2019s 1999 constitution. Opponents accuse him of trying to create a single-party, authoritarian system like that in Cuba.Electoral Council President Tibisay Lucena announced just before midnight Sunday that turnout was 41.53%, or 8,089,320 people.The count was met with mockery and anger from members of the opposition, who said they believed between 2 million and 3 million people voted.Julio Borges, president of the opposition-led National Assembly, said only 7% of the electorate had voted \u2014 a silent protest of Maduro's power grab, which would slam the brakes on democracy.The opposition had urged voters to boycott the vote, but millions of Venezuelans who hold government jobs were ordered to cast ballots or risk being fired.Others feared loss of social benefits like subsidized food. \u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m hoping for housing,\u201d admitted hairdresser Luisa Marquez, 46, as she waited in line to vote.Opinion polls had indicated that more than two-thirds of the nation opposed the president's move. The opposition said 7 million had voted against constitutional changes in a referendum it had organized a week ago.A midday check of 10 polling places here in the capital Sunday showed most of them empty or nearly empty.\u201cVenezuela has screamed with its silence,\u201d said Borges, who put the day's death toll at 12. The public prosecutor's office confirmed nine deaths.Maduro's vision of a new constitution to consolidate his power has drawn ire in Washington. Last week, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on 13 senior Venezuelan officials, and the White House and some U.S. lawmakers said stiffer sanctions could follow. Mexico said it would support U.S. sanctions, and the Organization of American States and the European Parliament have also expressed support for the opposition.Late Sunday, the U.S. State Department officially condemned the Venezuelan government for holding the vote, saying Maduro's bid to consolidate power would \u201cundermine the Venezuelan people\u2019s right to self-determination.\u201dU.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has called the vote a \u201csham election.\u201dIn Venezuela, opposition leaders refused to put up candidates, arguing that the election has been structured to ensure that Maduro\u2019s ruling socialist party dominates. Thus virtually all the more than 5,000 candidates for 545 assembly seats are Maduro supporters.The opposition vowed to protest despite a ban on public gatherings issued by Maduro. In some parts of the capital, people took to the streets in protest against the vote, but they were soon repelled by security forces throwing tear gas.During a protest, opposition supporters set an explosive that injured seven police officers, the public prosecutor's office said. After the blast, police set fire to four motorcycles belonging to journalists.Read more:After months of fatal protests, Venezuela braces for controversial vote SundayWhy this vote in Venezuela is so importantMaduro has struggled with a rapidly deteriorating economy and strengthening political opposition. Some voters said they believed the new assembly might improve life in Venezuela.\u201cI\u2019m voting today because I want peace to be restored,\u201d said seamstress Carmen Martinez, 44.

Pine View High School in March 2018, St.George, Utah, April 24, 2019 | Photo by court pool, St.George NewsST.GEORGE \u2014 A judge sentenced a Hurricane teen who brought a homemade bomb to his high school last year to serve four years of \"intensely supervised\" probation Wednesday.Martin Farnsworth appears in 5th District Court via video conference for his initial appearance, St.George, Utah, July 31, 2018 | File photo via court pool, St.George NewsMartin Farnsworth, 17, appeared in 5thDistrict Court Wednesday afternoon where Judge Michael Westfall sentenced him to serve 48 months of supervised probation and 250 hours of community service, along with additional restrictions.Farnsworth had been facing a potential five years-to-life prison term that came with the first-degree felony charge of attempting to injure others with an incendiary device that he pleaded guilty to last month as a part of a plea deal.Prior to taking the plea, Farnsworth faced felony charges for attempted murder and possession of a weapon of mass destruction.The case was originally set in juvenile court last year but was moved to 5th District Court where he was tried as an adult due to the severity of the incident involved.Read more: Judge: 16-year-old who brought bomb to Pine View High School will be tried as adultThe charges stem from a March 5, 2018 incident in which Farnsworth took a homemade explosive to Pine View High School.He placed the would-be incendiary device in a backpack in the cafeteria area during lunch and left after lighting a fuse.At the time, the cafeteria contained between 75-150 students.Pine View High School students are evacuated to the football field as police investigate a bomb scare inside the school and swept the parking lot as a precaution, St.George, Utah, March 5, 2018 | File photo by Mori Kessler, St.George NewsStudents noticed smoke coming from the backpack that contained the device and reported it to school faculty and the school\u2019s resource officer, triggering an evacuation of the school and a multi-agency response from law enforcement.While the incendiary device\u2019s fuse fizzled out and failed to ignite, investigators determined that if it had gone off, it would have caused damage to the immediate area and injured those near it.The device was constructed out of a \"metal soup can filled with metal BB shots removed from shot gun shells,\" according to court documents.It also included \"three canning lids with masking tape, BBs, an improvised fuse, black gun powder, white plastic cup, empty box of box-strike matches, three 16.9 oz.water bottles of gasoline\" and other items.Investigators found that Farnsworth learned to make an incendiary device via online instructions believed to be connected to the Islamic State terror group, according to court records and testimony.Public defender Edward Flint said he was pleased with the sentence in the Martin Farnsworth case, as getting his client released from further incarceration and placed on probation was a primary goal, St.George, Utah, April 24, 2019 | Photo by court pool, St.George NewsEdward Flint, Farnsworth\u2019s attorney, said that building the incendiary device and attempting to use it were a response to bullying his client had received at school and he finally snapped.The result was a criminal act, he added.\"The way life is going, it\u2019s not going well,\" Farnsworth said in a recording of a police interview after he was taken into custody.\"There\u2019s a bunch of bad people.I don\u2019t like the way the world is going.I just wanted to do something to make it different.\"Read more: \u2018If someone got hurt, I probably wouldn\u2019t care\u2019; Teen charged with attempted murder in Pine View High bomb scare\"He feels guilt and remorse, yes, but differently,\" Flint said, referring to Farnsworth being diagnosed with a mild, yet high-functioning form of autism and severe depression.The diagnosis was made by a mental health expert as a part of an evaluation connected to the pre-sentencing report.Read more: Defense in Pine View bombing case says Washington County School District failed teenFlint said the severe depression was a result of the bullying.The perceived lack of empathy on Farnsworth\u2019s part over what he\u2019d done was also a sign of autism spectrum disorder, and not necessary a sign the teen didn\u2019t regret was he had done.\"He\u2019s a model citizen and a good person all around \u2013 but he snapped,\" Flint said.Deputy Washington County Attorney Angela Adams addresses the court in regard to the sentencing of Martin Farnsworth, St.George, Utah, April 24, 2019 | Photo by Court Pool, St.George NewsWestfall did not agree with Flint\u2019s assessment.Being bullied to the point where you hit the bully is snapping, he said.In contrast, Farnsworth\u2019s action were planned out.\"This took some planning.This took some thought, and that\u2019s troubling to me, because you didn\u2019t just \u2018snap.\u2019\"Westfall also addressed Farnsworth prior to sentencing, mentioning that one of the teen\u2019s siblings had written a letter to the court saying the event didn\u2019t define who their brother was.\"Unfortunately, there are things we do that define us,\" Westfall said.\"Had this incendiary device gone off and someone had been hurt, not only would you be defined by this behavior, but so would your family.\"In addition to the 48 months of probation and 250 hours community service, Westfall ordered Farnsworth to wear an ankle monitor for 90 days, have no access to bomb-making materials, seek a psychiatric evaluation for the purpose of getting needed medications, have no internet access for six months, observe a curfew and write an apology letter to Pine View High and its students.Following the sentencing, Deputy Washington County Attorney Angela Adams, who prosecuted the case, said the state was satisfied with the outcome.5th District Judge Michael Westfall listens to the defense for Martin Farnsworth prior to handing down a sentence of 48 months\u2019 probation, St.George, Utah, April 24, 2019 | Photo by Court Pool, St.George News\"He\u2019s getting 48 months of intensely supervised probation,\" Adams said, adding that if Farnsworth does something to put his probation in jeopardy, he could still end up facing the five years-to-life sentence suspended by the judge.\"Of course, we hope he will be successful on probation,\" she said.Adams also said she believes justice was served to the extent that the community is being protected and all involved are doing what they can to minimize the possibility of this incident repeating itself.\"The state is satisfied that the safeguards put into place will protect the community.\"The defense was also pleased with the results of the sentencing.\"What we were hoping for was (Farnsworth) being released from custody into probation without any further juvenile or adult incarceration and that\u2019s what we got,\" Flint said.Farnsworth served 415 days in juvenile detention prior to being released Wednesday.As for the additional restrictions, Flint said they were to be expected and not out of the ordinary for a case involving a first-degree felony.When asked about his client\u2019s reaction, Flint said he didn\u2019t have much of one.\"Martin doesn\u2019t react much,\" he said.\"That\u2019s the nature of autism spectrum disorder.He\u2019s very quiet and introverted.\"Farnsworth\u2019s autism was an angle largely ignored by the state, Flint said, which led to him being treated as a common criminal rather than as someone who needed additional consideration.\"Individuals with autism have a difficult time understanding how other people feel, and have a difficult time processing their own feelings when they are bullied or made fun of or even when they interact normally with other people, they\u2019re going to react differently, and it\u2019s like none of that mattered,\" he said.\"He committed a crime, no doubt about that, but it seems like nobody\u2019s noticing that he\u2019s autistic and he needs help.\"Copyright St.George News, SaintGeorgeUtah.com LLC,

{"text": "Had his homemade bomb gone off\u2014one he had diabolically constructed using shrapnel coated with a substance meant to keep blood from clotting in wounds\u2014Kevin Harpham would have undoubtedly caused the death and injury of many people at last year\u2019s Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Unity March in Spokane, Washington.Instead, Harpham was eventually caught and recently sentenced to 32 years in prison for a hate crime and other offenses related to the attempted bombing. The case illustrates how a quick response by citizens and local law enforcement averted a tragedy and how teamwork and time-tested investigative techniques led to the apprehension of an individual who has shown no remorse for his actions.\u201cClearly he intended to detonate the device, cause mass carnage, and then survey the devastation,\u201d said Special Agent Frank Harrill, who supervised the investigation. \u201cHarpham was acting out against what he termed multiculturalism, but his hatred was firmly rooted in violent white supremacy. This was a prototypical hate crime.\u201dOn January 17, 2011, as hundreds of people gathered in downtown Spokane to participate in the march, Harpham placed his backpack bomb along the parade route at Washington Street and Main Avenue. Alert city workers discovered the suspicious backpack before the march started, and Spokane Police Department officials changed the route as a precaution. The Spokane Police and Sheriff\u2019s Office bomb squad was called in, and their precision in disarming the device enabled evidence to be preserved that would help lead FBI agents to Harpham.The FBI\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) in Spokane immediately began an investigation, and JTTF members canvassed the region for batteries and other components similar to those used in the bomb. Within a month, in a small town about 60 miles north of Spokane, they discovered that a local outlet of a large retail chain was selling the same kind of fishing weights Harpham had used as shrapnel.Store records showed there had been three large purchases of the weights in recent months\u2014two were paid for in cash, but a debit card was used in one transaction, and it belonged to Harpham. At the same time, the FBI Laboratory had been working to extract a DNA sample from the backpack that was later matched to Harpham through his military records.Investigators also learned of Harpham\u2019s white supremacy postings on the Internet and his affiliation with a neo-Nazi group called the National Alliance.Because he lived in a remote, relatively inaccessible area and was likely heavily armed, our Hostage Rescue Team devised a ruse to lure Harpham out of his house. He was arrested March 9, 2011 without incident\u2014but as agents suspected, he was armed when taken into custody.\u201cKevin Harpham was the lone wolf that all of us in law enforcement dread,\u201d Harrill said. \u201cHe lived alone, he worked alone, and he didn\u2019t foreshadow the bombing plot in any meaningful way. He targeted those who were attempting to celebrate an event meant to unite society,\u201d Harrill added, \u201cand he was prepared to indiscriminately kill men, women, and children.\u201dHarrill credited teamwork and strong partnerships for stopping Harpham and bringing him to justice. \u201cFrom the workers who noticed the device to the police response, the JTTF investigation, the expertise of the FBI Laboratory, and the prosecuting skill of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office\u2014everything worked just as it should have.\u201dResources:- Washington Man Sentenced to 32 Years (12/20/2011)- Attempted Bomber Pleads Guilty (09/07/2011)- Attempted Bomber Arrested (03/09/2011)", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentenced <extra_id_0> Defendant Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime offenses  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain caught <extra_id_0> Detainee Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain Arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Bomber <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence Sentenced <extra_id_0> Defendant Man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle disarming <extra_id_0> Artifact device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Disabler squad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Harrill <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Kevin Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonate <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Frank Harrill <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator Joint Terrorism Task Force <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Victim children <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact added <extra_id_0> Participant Harrill <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ImpedeInterfereWith stopping  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict Pleads Guilty <extra_id_0> Defendant Bomber <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack gone off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice his homemade bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble constructed <extra_id_0> Artifact one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components substance <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die death <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injury <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate march <extra_id_0> Demonstrator people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell purchases <extra_id_0> PaymentBarter debit card <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact postings <extra_id_0> Participant Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic white supremacy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection discovered <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity backpack <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Observer workers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate march  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Defense Admits Suspect's Guilt in Boston Marathon BombingThe defense lawyer for suspected Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told the jury at his trial Wednesday that he helped carry out the deadly 2013 attack, but contended that Tsarnaev's older brother was the mastermind behind the plot.\"It was him,\" attorney Judy Clarke said of her client, who is facing the death penalty if convicted of setting off a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs, packed with nails and ball bearings, at the finish line of the annual race in 2013 that killed three people and injured another 264.Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to the 30 counts against him, including the fatal shooting of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer days after the bombings as the Tsarnaevs tried to flee.Clarke, one of the U.S.'s foremost death penalty legal specialists, told jurors on the first day of the trial the defense will not \"sidestep\" Tsarnaev's guilt.Influence of older brotherBut she claimed that he was deeply influenced by his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, to carry out the attack, which a prosecutor alleged was aimed at avenging U.S. wars in Muslim countries.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev inadvertently killed his brother, running over him with a car, as they attempted to elude police days after authorities had identified them as suspects in the bombings.In this courtroom sketch, defense attorney Judy Clarke is depicted delivering opening statements in front of U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr., on the first day of the federal death penalty trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, March 4, 2015, in Boston.\"It was Tamerlan Tsarnaev who self-radicalized,\" Clarke said. \"It was Dzhokhar who followed him. The evidence will show that Tamerlan planned and orchestrated and enlisted his brother into this series of horrific acts.\"In blaming the older brother, Clarke's strategy appeared aimed at sparing the 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev from the death penalty. If Tsarnaev is convicted, the jury will decide whether he is executed or gets life in prison without the possibility of parole.The approach set up an immediate conflict with U.S. District Judge George O'Toole, who had ruled that the question of the relative culpability of the two brothers was best left to the trial's second phase, once Dzhokhar's guilt has been established.\u201cSome evidence of the brother's interactions will be inevitable,\u201d O'Toole allowed in brief remarks before the trial opened. But he interrupted Clarke multiple times to warn her against going too deep into family history.Defense lawyers had fought up to the last minute to have the trial moved out of Massachusetts, arguing the emotional impact of the bombings ran too deep and too many people had personal connections to the case. Their requests were rejected by O'Toole and a federal appeals court.Prosecutors lay out caseIn his opening statement, U.S. prosecutor William Weinreb accused the younger Tsarnaev of detonating bombs designed to \"tear people apart and create a bloody spectacle.\"Weinreb described the two homemade pressure cooker bombs used in the attack as the type \"favored by terrorists\" because of the mayhem and injuries they could cause. After the blasts, he said, \"The air was filled with the smell of burning sulfur and people's screams.\"Watch video from VOA's Carolyn Presutti:Video sizewidthxheightpixelsDefense Concedes Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Carried Out Boston Marathon BombingsShare this video0:02:20\u25b60:00:00/0:02:20\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 5.6MB360p | 7.7MB720p | 51.3MBThe prosecutor said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev \"believed that he was a soldier in a holy war against Americans.\" Weinreb said Tsarnaev \"also believed that by winning that victory, he had taken a step toward reaching paradise. That was his motive for committing these crimes.\"The shaggy-haired Tsarnaev stared straight ahead, avoiding looking at the jury, as the prosecutor spoke.Victims at trialMore than 20 victims of the blasts watched the early moments of the trial, taking up the entire left-hand side of the courtroom.Two dramatically different portraits of the former college student are expected to emerge during the trial.Was he a submissive, adoring younger brother who only followed directions given by his older, radicalized brother? Or was he a willing, active participant in the attacks?The brothers are ethnic Chechens who had lived in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and the volatile Dagestan region of Russia before coming to the U.S. with their parents and two sisters about a decade before the bombings.Some material for this report came from Reuters and AP.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack Bombing <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize suspected <extra_id_0> IdentifiedRole bomber <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 264 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shooting <extra_id_0> Target officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer brother <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize identified <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject them <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Identifier authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifiedRole suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt jury <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ReleaseParole parole <extra_id_0> Defendant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt jury <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain gets life in prison <extra_id_0> Detainee he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Prosecutor William Weinreb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonating <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Instrument they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime mayhem  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack Bombings <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crimes  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

Social media began rumors about various deaths within the hospital caused by bacteria similar to Neisseria meningitides.Angel Sarmiento, president of Aragua Medical School, announced eight people died of the yet unidentified disease. He said it was not Ebola, meningitis, dengue or chikungunya. He added that the victims were four children and four adults.The symptoms exhibited by the dead were spots on the body that turned to boils, high fever, massive hemorrhaging stemming from smaller hemorrhagic incidents, and multi-organ failure. The disease took around 72 hours to run its course.\"We don't know what we are confronting,\" Sarmiento said. \"We don't know if it's a virus or bacteria. How can we heal what we don't know?\"However, there may not be any disease to battle. The governor of Aragua, who is also the state's leader of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, denies Sarmiento's claims, according to the Latin American Herald Tribune.Gov. Tarek el Aissami said, \"I need to start by categorically denying the existence of some virus or bacteria on the premises of the Maracay Central Hospital that is putting the lives of patients at risk.\"Aragua's governor refuted Sarmiento's claim and called them a \"terrorist matrix that has a basic purpose, which is to create alarm, anguish in Aragua's population.\" He added that the deceased died of different causes, including an old man dying of diabetes and one of the children from leukemia.\"What you are is a criminal, who, irresponsibly using your status as a doctor, launched this campaign without finding out the facts, without investigating, and in these last few hours you've caused terrible anguish among the people of Aragua,\" el Aissami said about Sarmiento.The governor called on the Attorney General's office to investigate Sarmiento.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak virus <extra_id_0> Place state <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak bacteria <extra_id_0> Place hospital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak disease <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak virus <extra_id_0> Place the Maracay Central Hospital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim patients <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak bacteria <extra_id_0> Place the Maracay Central Hospital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim patients <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "A Canadian academic was charged in Paris on Saturday over the deadly 1980 bombing of a Paris synagogue, the man\u2019s lawyer said.University professor Hassan Diab, a Canadian of Lebanese descent, appeared before an anti-terror judge just hours after arriving from Montreal after losing a six-year legal battle against extradition.The October 3, 1980, bombing of a synagogue on rue Copernic in Paris killed four people and marked the first fatal attack against the French Jewish community since the Nazi occupation in World War II.Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign UpThe 60-year-old sociologist had been fighting his extradition to avoid what he said would be an unfair prosecution in France for a crime he insists he did not commit.Diab\u2019s extradition came after Canada\u2019s supreme court refused on Thursday to hear his final plea to halt the procedure.Diab was arrested at his home in an Ottawa suburb in November 2008 at the request of French authorities who alleged he was a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.The extremist group pioneered armed jetliner hijackings in the 1960s and was believed to be behind a string of deadly attacks in Europe, including the Paris bombing.Canada\u2019s justice minister signed an order in April 2012 to send Diab to France after a Canadian court approved his extradition, despite its concerns that the French case was \u201cweak\u201d.Diab has said he has \u201cabsolutely no connection whatsoever to the terrible 1980 attack,\u201d while his legal team argued he should not be extradited because a conviction in Canada would be unlikely.Synagogue packedThat attack on the synagogue happened on a Friday evening, the eve of the Jewish sabbath when it was packed with some 300 worshipers.Ten kilograms of explosives packed in the saddlebags of a parked motorcycle were detonated and the ensuing blast killed three Frenchmen and a young Israeli woman and wounded some 40 people.Police first focused on the far right as possible perpetrators of the bombing before turning their attention to extremist groups in the Middle East, but made no headway in the case for years.The probe was relaunched in October 2007 to gain information from the United States on Diab, who had spent several years in the country.Diab became a Canadian citizen in 2006 and is now the father of a nearly two-year-old girl with his common-law wife.He has claimed that he was studying in Beirut at the time of the bombing and has said that he had been confused with someone with the same name.Diab\u2019s lawyers in Canada have mainly sought to discredit what they called \u201cfatally flawed\u201d handwriting analysis of a Paris hotel slip that French authorities say was signed in the same false identity that was also presented to purchase the motorcycle used in the bombing.Diab\u2019s lawyers have said that the fingerprint evidence does not match Diab\u2019s and that the person who signed the hotel slip was described by witnesses as being middle-aged, whereas Diab would have been 26 at the time.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant academic <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Paris <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target synagogue <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Paris <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target synagogue <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place rue Copernic <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target community <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing appeared <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt judge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant Hassan Diab <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation arriving <extra_id_0> Origin Montreal <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Hassan Diab <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Diab <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Place Europe <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Paris <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target synagogue <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim woman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime probe <extra_id_0> Defendant Diab <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell purchase <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity motorcycle <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

One blew up outside the Old Bailey criminal court, while the other went off outside Scotland Yard.Strict securityThe 10-week trial at Winchester Crown Court has seen some of the strictest security precautions in British legal history.The court was heavily guarded throughout, and as the verdict was delivered, four rows of plain-clothes detectives sat bethind the dock and at least 15 prison officers surrounded the defendants. All doors to the court were bolted.First, the jury returned a not-guilty verdict on Roisin McNearney, a known IRA activist who is believed to have helped the police identify the other conspirators.As her verdict was handed down, the other defendants began to hum the Dead March from Saul, and one threw a coin at her, shouting \"Take your blood money with you\" as she left the dock in tears.A number of threats have already been made to members of her family and she has said she is unlikely ever to be able to return to her native Belfast.'Murderous enterprises'As the eight guilty defendants were led to the cells below the court several gave clenched fist salutes to relatives and friends in the public gallery, who shouted \"Keep your chins up\" and \"All the best\".The judge then addressed Miss McNearney, saying, \"You have learned a bitter lesson and I hope it has taught you and others like you not to dabble in murderous enterprises.\"He then ordered that she be given police protection.The two women defendants, Dolours and Marian Price, were believed to have played the most important role in the conspiracy, along with a third defendant, Hugh Feeney.

On the afternoon of November 21, with emotions running high, all police leave was cancelled and an extra 1,300 officers were drafted in to guard his coffin as it was driven to Coventry airport and flown to Ireland.But hours after the funeral procession, two bombs exploded in two packed Birmingham city centre pubs.It has been claimed that a 'link man' ordered the revenge attacks in an impulsive grief-stricken reaction to McDade's death - without the blessing of IRA chiefs in Belfast. The secret figure, whose identity has never been revealed, is believed to have then left for Ireland to attend the funeral and has remained there ever since.Another theory is that the bombings were revenge attacks for the Loyalist Dublin and Monaghan bombings six months earlier.Thirty four people died in the Ulster Volunteer Force attacks, labelled the worst atrocity of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It has been claimed the British security forces colluded with the loyalist terrorists in the bombings.Mick Murray was one of three men arrested along with the Birmingham Six by West Midlands Police in the immediate aftermath of the pub blasts.It has been claimed that Murray, who died in 1999, helped choose the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town as targets.And he was named as being one of the bomb-makers who transported the explosives to the city centre before handing them to the men who planted them.But, it is claimed Murray then botched a telephone warning made to our sister newspaper The Birmingham Post. It was supposed to give half an hour for the pubs to be cleared. But his warning, using the codeword Double X, came just six minutes before the first explosion - and did not name either pub.Murray admitted being a member of the IRA after his arrest. But West Midlands Police never charged him with murder and he served 12 years in jail for conspiracy to cause explosions.In 1990 his name was mentioned in a report handed to the Government by the Who Bombed Birmingham? Granada TV programme.The show was based on a book by campaigning MP, Chris Mullin, who said he met the real bombers, but could not reveal their identity.In another Parliamentary report, the MP stated the programme-makers had also passed a Special Branch document containing details of interviews with an IRAman to the Home Office. The unnamed terrorist had been arrested in November 1975 - six months after the trial and conviction of the Birmingham Six.Mr Mullin claimed the terrorist gave police accurate information including the names of some of those whom he said were responsible for the bombs.Crucially, the papers contained the remark: 'So-and-so told me he put one of the bombs in the pub.'AlongwithMurrayand the Birmingham Six two other men - including James Kelly - were arrested in the immediate aftermath of the carnage.Kelly was found guilty of possessing explosives and bizarrely claimed he was a spy who infiltrated the IRA so he could later give help to the police.The Birmingham Six were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1975 for the pub bombings. They were all Belfast born but had lived in Brum since the 1960s.Five of them had left the city on the early evening of November 21 from New Street Station - hours before the explosions - to travel to Belfast to attend McDade's funeral. They were seen off by Callaghan.The five were arrested at Heysham that evening and Callaghan was taken into custody the next day.All the men were interrogated by Birmingham CID and claimed at trial they were beaten, threatened and forced to sign statements written by the police over three days of questioning.Their convictions were overturned by the Court of Appeal in March1991and their case is seen as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British legal history.Terrorist activity was rife in the Midlands during the 1970sand police arrested scores of IRA members in the months following the bombings.But the IRA unit which gained particular notoriety was the Birmingham Nine. They were responsible for 20 of the 31 bomb blasts in Birmingham and parts of the West Midlands between August 1973 and August 1974.Patrick Guilfoyle, Martin Coughlan, Gerard Young, Joseph Duffy, Michael Murray, Anthony Madigan, Joseph Ashe, Gerald Small and Stephen Blake conducted the biggest wave of bombings in the region since the Second World War.Coughlan and Young were said to be the leading figures in the campaign.Coughlan was born in Dublin and came to Birmingham in 1956. He rented a house in Chelmsley Wood with his wife and had three children.It is believed he was the brains behind the campaign of terror which began in Birmingham and spread to Manchester.Guilfoyle never quite made the grade of bomber. He caused an explosion that badly injured one of his IRA colleagues because he was smoking a cigarette while making a bomb.Northern Ireland historian David McVea said: 'Many different theories have been put forward as to who actually carried out the bombings, but it is unlikely that the true culprits will ever be identified.'The IRA was very protective of its members at the time, people moved in and out of the different cells constantly. 'As well as the killing of so many innocent people the real tragedy is the wrongful jailing of the Birmingham Six.'The IRA was able to use the injustice against these men to their advantage for years.'CAPTION(S):SLAUGHTERED: victims are taken away from the pub bombings; DEVASTATED: wreckage outside the Tavern in the Town; DEAD: James McDade; TRIBUTE: memorial to the victims", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Attacker Mick Murray <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target two pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham city <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain jailed <extra_id_0> Detainee The nine men <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant Birmingham Nine <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham city <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict served <extra_id_0> Prosecutor West Midlands Police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee terrorist <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict conviction <extra_id_0> Defendant Birmingham Six <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee James Kelly <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentenced <extra_id_0> Defendant Birmingham Six <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime interrogated <extra_id_0> Defendant men <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Investigator Birmingham CID <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Attacker Patrick Guilfoyle <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place region <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
