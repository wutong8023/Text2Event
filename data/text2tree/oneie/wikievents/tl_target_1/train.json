{"text": "Cuba sidesteps Colombia\u2019s request to extradite the rebels after Bogota blames the group for Thursday\u2019s car bombing.Colombia has asked Cuba to hand over the rebels affiliated with National Liberation Army (ELN), who were in Havana for peace talks, after a deadly car bombing in Bogota was blamed on the group.Conservative President Ivan Duque urged Communist-ruled Cuba, a host and one of the guarantors of the peace process, to send home the ELN rebels in Havana.Cuba\u2019s foreign minister said in a tweet late on Friday that the country would respect the protocols of the negotiations it had been hosting and was consulting with both parties and the guarantors of the talks.On Friday, Colombia blamed the leftist ELN for the bombing of a police academy in Bogota that killed 20 people as well as the attacker, dealing a big blow to the peace process.190102132047518Duque then announced that he was reinstating arrest warrants for 10 ELN members, who are part of the group\u2019s delegation to the Cuba talks.The talks were aimed at ending more than five decades of fighting by the Marxist-inspired group. Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels.The police academy car bombing \u201cwas a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [Cuba acting] to avoid justice being done\u201d, Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima.Colombians, including Duque, planned to join in a march on Sunday to protest against the car bombing, the worst such attack in the country in 16 years.Last rebel groupIn November, Colombia asked Cuba to capture ELN rebel commander Nicolas Rodriguez and provide information about the presence of other commanders in the Cuban territory.The government in Bogota also asked Havana to act on an Interpol Red Notice against Rodriguez. The Cuban government did not respond publicly to that request or made a statement about the issue.Colombia has experienced several years of relative calm since the 2016 peace accord signed by then-President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) fighters.190118182118648With the landmark agreement turning the former rebels into a political party, the smaller ELN is considered the last active rebel group in the country.True to his election promises, Duque has taken a hard line against the ELN.Peace talks with the ELN began in February 2017 under Santos, but Duque has put them on hold until the rebels free all their hostages and stop attacks on military and civilian targets.The group is believed to be currently holding 17 hostages, some of them for several years.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand request <extra_id_0> Communicator Colombia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Cuba <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ImpedeInterfereWith sidesteps <extra_id_0> Impeder Cuba <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Bogota <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker National Liberation Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand urged <extra_id_0> Communicator Ivan Duque <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Cuba <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim attacker <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer ELN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker ELN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target academy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Bogota <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand asked <extra_id_0> Communicator Colombia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Cuba <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain capture <extra_id_0> Detainee Nicolas Rodriguez <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protest <extra_id_0> Demonstrator Colombians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Suspected New York Bomber Wounded in Shootout with PoliceThe suspect in Saturday night's bombing in New York City that wounded 29 people is in a hospital recovering from bullet wounds after a shootout with police.Prosecutors have charged 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami with five counts of attempted murder stemming from the shootout that wounded two officers.Police arrested Rahami in Linden, New Jersey \u2014 outside Manhattan \u2014 hours after police sent out a city-wide bulletin with his picture, saying he was wanted for questioning.A bar owner in Linden called police Monday morning to complain that a man was sleeping in a doorway of his business. Officers recognized the man as Rahami, who opened fire, wounding two policemen before he was injured.None of the wounds are considered life-threatening.Police officers walk near the site where Ahmad Khan Rahami, sought in connection with a bombing in New York, was taken into custody in Linden, New Jersey, U.S., Sept. 19, 2016.The FBI is not saying how they zeroed in on Rahami as the bombing suspect. But investigators reportedly saw him on surveillance video at the bomb site in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, and near a second bomb allegedly left several blocks away. The second explosive was found before it could detonate.Investigators also reportedly found fingerprints on a bomb fragment.Video sizewidthxheightpixelsFollowing Terror Suspect Capture, New York Remains VigilantShare this video0:02:12\u25b60:00:00/0:02:12\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 6.3MB360p | 9.9MB720p | 56.3MBOther bombsThe FBI wants to question Rahami about another bombing Saturday morning in Seaside Park, New Jersey, south of New York, that forced the cancellation of a charity road race. No one was injured.Other bombs were found in a garbage can at a train station Sunday morning in Elizabeth, New Jersey. One of the bombs exploded while a robot was trying to disarm it. Again, no one was hurt.FILE - Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials label and collect evidence near the site of an explosion which took place on Saturday night in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, Sept. 18, 2016.Rahami's alleged motive for the bombings is unknown.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Rahami is the only suspect so far. The mayor on Monday said there is every reason to believe the bombings were acts of terrorism, and the FBI is looking for any links to foreign terror groups.Obama: We have to be vigilantSpeaking in New York, President Barack Obama said the investigation is moving rapidly and that everyone is working together to get to the bottom of what happened. He said terrorists and extremists want to hurt innocent people, inspire fear and disrupt life.President Barack Obama speaks about last Saturday's bombing in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood in New York, Sept. 19, 2016.\"We have to be vigilant and aggressive, both on preventing senseless acts of violence but also making sure that we find those who carry out such acts and bring them to justice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don't succumb to that fear.\"One New Yorker told VOA that the bombing was unsettling, but not surprising.\"There is a security to this city. Sure there are days where I have my doubts about that, but because I do feel this camaraderie in the city, I do feel relatively safe.\"Suspect called friendlySuspected bomber Rahami was born in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He and his family run a fried-chicken restaurant in Linden that has a steady number of loyal customers. But it also had trouble with the city of Linden for what neighbors said was round-the-clock noise and crowds at the eatery.Some of the restaurant's customers say they are shocked that Rahami is a suspect, calling him friendly. They say he let local bands practice in the back of the restaurant, and gave them free food.New York City Afghan community leader Masjid Dar al Taqwa condemned the bombings.\"Everyone ... is shocked and saddened by what has happened,\" he told VOA. \"They condemn all forms of violence.

{"text": "An IRA member who was part of the group behind the Birmingham pub bombings has apologised.Michael Christopher Hayes \u2013 a self-confessed bomb maker \u2013 said he was sorry for the killing of innocent people in the 1974 blasts.Speaking to the BBC, Mr Hayes said he hoped his apology on behalf of all active republicans will help grieving relatives find \"closure\".He said: \"My apologies and my heartfelt sympathies to all of you, for the terrible, tragic loss that you've been put through. And all these years you've been trying to find closure. I hope at last God will be merciful and bring you closure.\"And I apologise not only for myself ... I apologise for all active republicans who had no intention of hurting anybody and sympathise with you.\"An eight-minute delay before police were warned of the bombs' location led to the death of 21 people and the injury of 182 others, when they exploded in a pair of city centre pubs. Mr Hayes said the bombs had not been intended to kill people.On the evening of the 21 November 1974, a man with an Irish accent called the Birmingham Post and Evening Mail newspapers to say two bombs were planted in the town centre.He finished the call by giving the official code used by the Provisional IRA to authenticate a warning call and allow civilians to be evacuated.Former IRA officials have since said there was an unintentional delay in issuing the warning.Mr Hayes said the IRA unit in Birmingham had been shocked by the death toll.\"That wasn't meant. It wouldn't have been done if that was the case,\" he said.The wreckage left at the Mulberry Bush pub in Birmingham after a bomb exploded on 21 November 1974 (PA)The Birmingham pub bombings caused the worst single losses of life in the Troubles. Six men were wrongfully convicted for the blasts but no-one has ever been brought to justice.Mr Hayes, 69, who now lives in south Dublin, said he personally defused a third bomb on Birmingham's Hagley Road after he became aware of the death toll in the first two blasts.He refused to say who planted the bombs in the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town but he said he wanted to speak out to give \"the point of view of a participant\".But relatives of those who were killed said the apology was \"gutless and spineless\".Mr Hayes' apology came as an inquest into the bombings was reopened by a coroner stating \"a wealth of evidence\" had not yet been heard.West Midland Police said their investigation remained open but that no further comments on the suspects' identities will be provided until the proceedings have concluded.Victims' families have repeatedly asked for the names of the suspects to be disclosed.Mr Hayes was arrested and questioned by West Midlands Police about the bombings in 1974 but he was released.He said he had been a member of the IRA for more than 30 years in both Ireland and England and had participated in the group's activities in Birmingham as \"an active volunteer\".UK news in pictures Show all 50 1 /50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 18 September 2020 A model presents a creation during the Bora Aksu catwalk show at London Fashion Week 2020 Reuters UK news in pictures 17 September 2020 World kickboxing champion Carl Thomas during his attempt to run a marathon while pulling a plane at Elvington Airfield near York.

Another 1,200 patients are under observation.But Rafael Arreaza, a surgeon and former director of Venezuela\u2019s Social Security service, questioned the minister\u2019s figures and filed a complaint against the government with the Ombudsman.Arreaza said that for every patient diagnosed with Chikungunya, there could be as many as 1,000 more, and that the lack of lab material is preventing health workers from knowing the true magnitude of the problem.This former health official also said that 12 of the victims who died were showing similar symptoms, suggesting the need to find out whether the virus is mutating.In the face of this mounting pressure, President Maduro said he will take national and international legal action against any physician but also against any journalist, media outlet or individual who contributes to disseminating this theory through words or images.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak disease <extra_id_0> Place Venezuela <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak Chikungunya <extra_id_0> Victim patient <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak Chikungunya <extra_id_0> Victim patient <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak virus <extra_id_0> Victim victims <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Investigation of the Belated Production of Documents in the Oklahoma City Bombing Case\"The bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on April 19, 1995, was, at the time, the most significant act of terrorism that had ever taken place in the United States. Government agencies, led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), immediately began an extensive investigation to identify and prosecute the culprits. The investigation, known as OKBOMB, was run by a Task Force that consisted primarily of FBI investigators and support personnel and Department of Justice prosecutors. Within a few months, three individuals-Timothy McVeigh, Terry Nichols, and Michael Fortier-were indicted for crimes relating to the bombing. McVeigh and Nichols were convicted after trials, and Fortier pled guilty as part of a plea agreement with the government. McVeigh, who had devised the plot to bomb the Murrah Building and had planted the bomb, was sentenced to death. On May 8, 2001, one week before McVeigh's scheduled execution date, the Department of Justice and the FBI revealed to McVeigh's and Nichols' attorneys that over 700 investigative documents had not been disclosed to the defendants before their trials. The government acknowledged that it had violated a discovery order in the case, and the Attorney General stayed McVeigh's execution for one month in order to resolve the legal issues arising from the belated disclosure. Following the public revelation of the problem, and after finding and releasing more than 300 additional OKBOMB documents to the defense, the FBI came under severe criticism for its handling of the OKBOMB documents.\"United States.

{"text": "A 40-year-old Japanese man admitted he landed an unmanned drone in central Tokyo carrying radioactive sand atop Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's office to protest nuclear power, police said Saturday.The drone, which had a sign on it saying it was radioactive, was carrying a camera and plastic container with sand contaminated with radioactive cesium, Japanese media said. The police said the radiation was low and did not pose a threat. The stunt initially brought fears of a terrorist attack.Yasuo Yamamoto, who is unemployed, faces a maximum three years in prison if convicted on charges of obstruction of official business. Local media reported that the police said the landing was a protest against nuclear power.Abe is pushing to restart Japan's nuclear reactors which are offline in the wake of the Fukushima disaster caused by a tsunami in 2011. Public broadcaster NHK said the sand the drone was carrying came from an area near the Fukushima meltdown.The drone was discovered Wednesday when new employees were taking a tour of the roof. It was believed to have landed there two weeks ago.\u201cI was operating the drone around 3:30 in the morning on April 9 to express my opposition to nuclear power generation,\u201d police quoted the alleged drone operator as saying.The Asahi Shimbun said the man surrendered to police on Friday.

{"text": "Wealth of Clues Led to Quick Arrest of New York Suspected BomberNEW YORK \u2014\u00a0The man suspected of planting bombs in a New York neighborhood and a New Jersey seaside town may have aimed to inflict carnage incognito, but he didn't succeed for long in concealing his identity.Ahmad Khan Rahami provided investigators with a wealth of clues that led to his arrest about 50 hours after the first explosion, according to three law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation.His fingerprints and DNA were found at the scene of the Manhattan bombing, they said. His uncovered face was clearly captured by surveillance cameras near the spot of the blast.Electronic toll records show a car to which he had access was driven from New Jersey to Manhattan and back to New Jersey the day of the bombing, according to the officials, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss an ongoing case.Those and other clues spurred officials to publicize his name and photo Monday morning, asking for help finding Rahami, 28, a Muslim U.S. citizen born in Afghanistan, who lives with his family in Elizabeth, New Jersey.As the investigation heated up, a bar owner in Linden, New Jersey, reported someone asleep in his doorway. An officer went to investigate and recognized the man as Rahami, police and the mayor said.Rahami pulled a gun and shot the officer \u2014 who was wearing a bulletproof vest \u2014 in the torso, and more officers joined in a running gun battle along the street and brought Rahami down, police Capt. James Sarnicki said. Another police officer was grazed by a bullet.\"A lot of technology involved in this, but a lot of good, old-fashioned police work, too,\" said New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill. He said now, investigators would \"make sure that we get to the bottom of who's involved and why.\"After surgery for a gunshot wound to his leg, Rahami was being held on $5.2 million bail, charged with five counts of attempted murder of police officers. Federal prosecutors said they still were weighing charges over the bombings. Rahami remains hospitalized.Messages left for family members were not immediately returned. It wasn't clear when Rahami would get an attorney.Officials said they have no other suspects at large, but cautioned they are still investigating.The bombing spread fear across the New York area and revived anxiety about homegrown terrorism nationwide.As the East Coast was rattled by the bombings, a man who authorities say referred to Allah wounded nine people in a stabbing rampage at a Minnesota mall Saturday before being shot to death by an off-duty police officer. Authorities are investigating the stabbings as a possible terrorist attack but have not drawn any connection between the bloodshed there and the bombings.William Sweeney Jr., the FBI's assistant director in New York, said there was no indication so far that the bombings were the work of a larger terror cell.Rahami wasn't on any terror or no-fly watch lists, though he had been interviewed for immigration purposes traveling between the U.S. and Afghanistan, one of the law enforcement officials said.Rahami and his family live above their restaurant \u2014 called First American Fried Chicken \u2014 and the family has clashed with the city over closing times and noise complaints, which the Rahamis said in a lawsuit were tinged with anti-Muslim sentiment.The lawsuit was terminated in 2012 because one of Rahami's brothers had pleaded guilty to blocking police from enforcing closing hours at the restaurant.A childhood friend, Flee Jones, said Rahami had become more religious after returning from a trip to Afghanistan several years ago. Still, some of the family restaurant's customers said Rahami was more likely to talk about his interest in cars than to mention faith.\"He's a very friendly guy,\" patron Ryan McCann said. \"That's what's so scary.\"The investigation began when a pipe bomb blew up Saturday morning in Seaside Park, New Jersey, before a charity race to benefit Marines. No one was injured.Then a shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bomb exploded Saturday night in New York's Chelsea section, wounding 29 people, none seriously. An unexploded pressure-cooker bomb was found blocks away.Late Sunday night, five explosive devices were discovered in a trash can at an Elizabeth train station, about 3 miles from where Rahami was later found asleep in the doorway of a bar.Investigators are still gathering evidence and have not publicly tied Rahami to those devices, though Sweeney noted they aren't \"ruling anything out.\"The bombs discovered Saturday all used flip cellphones as a trigger and were all made with easily purchasable materials, a federal law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said.After zeroing in on Rahami and learning of the car that had traveled between New Jersey and New York, authorities pulled it over Sunday night after it headed in the direction of Kennedy airport. The law enforcement officials said at least one of Rahami's relatives was in the car.All five were questioned and released, Sweeney said. He declined to say whether they might later face charges.Around the time Rahami was captured, President Barack Obama was in New York on a previously scheduled visit for a meeting of the U.N. General Assembly. He called on Americans to show the world \"we will never give in to fear.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain Arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee Bomber <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble planting <extra_id_0> Artifact bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place town <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator officials <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Manhattan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation driven <extra_id_0> Vehicle car <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin New Jersey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination New Jersey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigate <extra_id_0> Investigator officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shot <extra_id_0> Attacker Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument gun <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain brought <extra_id_0> Detainee Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer officers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure grazed <extra_id_0> Instrument bullet <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wound <extra_id_0> Victim Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Intervention surgery  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigating  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Injurer Allah <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shot <extra_id_0> Attacker officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Allah <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigating <extra_id_0> Investigator Authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation traveling <extra_id_0> Origin Afghanistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination U.S. <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict pleaded <extra_id_0> Defendant one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation returning <extra_id_0> Destination Afghanistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place New Jersey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die wounding <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation traveled <extra_id_0> Origin New Jersey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination New York <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ReleaseParole released <extra_id_0> Defendant five <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain captured <extra_id_0> Detainee Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

ReutersMeanwhile, Venezuelans appeared to be abstaining in massive numbers on Sunday in a show of silent protest against a vote to select a constitutional assembly giving the government virtually unlimited powers.Associated Press journalists toured more than two dozen polling places in neighborhoods across the capital, including many traditional strongholds of the ruling socialist party in southern and western Caracas. Virtually all the polling places saw hours-long lines of thousands of people in past elections over the last two decades of socialist government.One site, a sports and cultural complex known as the Poliedro, had several thousand people waiting about two hours to vote, many having traveled from opposition-dominated neighborhoods where polling places were closed. Of the dozens of others sites seen by the AP, two in the loyalist-heavy neighborhood of El Valle had lines of approximately 200 to 400 people. All the others had at most a couple of dozen voters, and many had less than a half-dozen or were completely empty.Opinion polls say more than 70 percent of the country is opposed to Sunday's vote.\"People aren't in agreement with this,\" said Daniel Ponza, a 33-year-old drywall contractor, as he watched a few dozen people outside a polling place in El Valle. \"People are dying of hunger, looking for food in the trash.

The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear.After voting at dawn, President Nicolas Maduro called for international acceptance of what he called his government's fight against a violent opposition trying to sabotage his administration.Motorcycles burn after clashes broke out while the Constituent Assembly election was being carried out in Caracas, Venezuela, on Sun., July 30, 2017. ReutersThe run-up to the vote has been marked by months of clashes between protesters and the government that have left at least 116 dead and nearly 2,000 wounded. A 61-year-old nurse was fatally shot by men accused of being pro-government paramilitaries during a protest at a church a few hundred feet from the school where Maduro voted.\"We've stoically withstood the terrorist, criminal violence,\" Maduro said. \"Hopefully the world will respectfully extend its arms toward our country.\"In an unusual moment this morning when Maduro cast his own ballot on state-controlled national television, his national ID card was to be scanned. He intended to make a statement that his vote was counted and said: \"We are going to verify my national ID card so that the record shows that I came to vote and my ID card will show this for posterity, that I voted on this historic day of the constituent assembly of July 30th.\"Nicolas Maduro having his national ID card scanned. ReutersWhen the female official of the National Electoral Council (CNE) proceeds to use a smartphone to scan Maduro's card, a second camera zooms in to reveal that according to CNE's own system, that \"person does not exist, or the card has been revoked.\"After scanning Maduro's national ID card, the smartphone read: \"person does not exist, or the card has been revoked.\" ReutersMaduro appears livid but doesn't acknowledge the misshap, pauses for a second and then grabs his wife's ID card for scanning.Social media was abuzz with the misshap, which fanned the flames of speculation about the place of birth of the socialist president, whose mother is rumored to be a Colombian national. Following an opposition-mandated special commission investigation into the matter, the socialist-majority Supreme Court issued a ruling last October that stated that Maduro had been born in Caracas in 1962, but did not produce a birth certificate.Some opposition leaders continue to sustain that they have proof that Maduro was born a Colombian national, which would make him constitutionally ineligible to occupy the presidency.Maduro's highly vocal critic and former president of Colombia ridiculed Maduro in a tweet that reads: \"My fellow countryman, didn't they let you vote?\"Paisano \u00bf No te dejaron votar? https://t.co/ouVWI4eMtS \u2014 Andr\u00e9s Pastrana A (@AndresPastrana_) July 30, 2017Despite that hiccup, the opposition is boycotting Sunday's vote, contending the election has been structured to ensure Maduro's socialist party continues to dominate. So all 5,500 candidates for the 545 seats in the constituent assembly are his supporters and the vote's success is being measured by turnout.The government is encouraging participation with tactics that include offering social benefits like subsidized food to the poor and threatening state workers' jobs if they don't vote.\"I'm here because I'm hoping for housing,\" said Luisa Marquez, a 46-year-old hairdresser.Others said they were there out of conviction that the constitutional assembly would help the government fend off what they called an international capitalist conspiracy to undermine Venezuela's socialist system with the help of the domestic opposition.\"The crisis, the shortages of food and medicine, that isn't the government's fault,\" said Luis Osuna, a 42-year-old private bodyguard. \"Those who are attacking us to kill us with hunger and blame the government are the same enemies the government's always had.\"Women shout slogans during a protest held by Venezuelans in Spain against Venezuela's Constituent Assembly election, in Madrid, Spain, on July 30, 2017.

Inflation and homicide rates are among the world's highest and widespread shortages of food and medicine have citizens dying of preventable illnesses and rooting through trash to feed themselves.The special assembly being selected Sunday will have powers to rewrite the country's 1999 constitution but will also have powers above and beyond other state institutions, including the opposition-controlled congress.While opinion polls say a vast majority oppose him, Maduro made clear in a televised address Saturday evening that he intends to use the assembly to govern without limitation, describing the vote as \"the election of a power that's above and beyond every other.\"He said he wants the assembly to strip opposition legislators of their constitutional immunity from prosecution and indicated he eager to prosecute many more members of the opposition parties that control a handful of state governments along with the National Assembly, providing one of the few remaining checks on the power of the socialist party that has ruled this OPEC nation for nearly two decades.\"The right wing already has its prison cell waiting,\" the president said. \"All the criminals will go to prison for the crimes they've committed.\"Saying the assembly will begin to govern within a week, Maduro said its first task in rewriting the constitution will be \"a total transformation\" of the office of Venezuela's chief prosecutor, a former government loyalist who has become the highest-ranking official to publicly split from the president.The Trump administration has imposed successive rounds of sanctions on high-ranking members of Maduro's administration, with the support of countries including Mexico, Colombia and Panama. Vice President Mike Pence promised on Friday that the U.S. would take \"strong and swift economic actions\" if the vote went ahead. He didn't say whether the U.S. would sanction Venezuelan oil imports, a measure with the potential to undermine Maduro but cause an even deeper humanitarian crisis here.Maduro's supporters on the Supreme Court set off the protests and clashes between police and demonstrator when they tried to strip the National Assembly of its powers in April. Most of the dead have been protesters apparently shot by police and government-linked paramilitaries.The opposition has organized a series of work stoppages as well as a July 16 protest vote that it said drew more than 7.5 million symbolic votes against the constitutional assembly.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle burn <extra_id_0> Artifact barricade <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle detonated <extra_id_0> Artifact motorcycles <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle burn <extra_id_0> Artifact Motorcycles <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
