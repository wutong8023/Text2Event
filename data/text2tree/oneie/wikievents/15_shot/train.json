Taken as a whole, the evidence suggests that the plan to bomb the Boston Marathon took shape over three months.A key issue for jurors \u2014 both in the guilt phase and later in the penalty phase if Tsarnaev is convicted \u2014 will be whether the jurors see Tsarnaev as an equal partner with his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, in the Boston Marathon bombing and the violent events that followed.As of Tuesday morning, jurors began reviewing evidence and witness testimony, which will play a role in helping them decide Dzhokhar Tsarnaev\u2019s guilt on each of the 30 charges he faces.AdvertisementJanuary 2013Tsarnaev, then 19, talks to his close friend, Stephen Silva, about borrowing Silva\u2019s 9mm P95 Ruger semi-automatic pistol.

{"text": "Indonesian Police Receive Terrorist Threat Targeting BaliJAKARTA \u2014\u00a0In Indonesia there are growing concerns that more deadly attacks could follow last week\u2019 bombings in Jakarta by Islamist militants.Bali police Tuesday say they received an anonymous letter warning that the resort Island will be the next target for a terrorist assault.\"The letter was sent by an anonymous individual to Buleleng district, and the police are still conducting an investigation, and trying to find out who sent the letter. But again, I urge people in Bali not to be afraid, but they should stay alert,\" said Bali Police Chief Sugeng Priyanto.Authorities say they've increased security at shopping malls and other locations that draw crowds in Bali.In 2002, the popular resort island was targeted by Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), an Indonesia-based terrorist group with links to al-Qaida. The bombing of a club in Bali killed 202 people, mostly foreigners.The Bali bombing severely hurt Indonesia\u2019s tourism industry, and began a decade of deadly plots in Indonesia carried out by Southeast Asian militants affiliated with al-Qaida.Indonesia successfully combated the JI related terrorist threat through police action, intelligence operations and high profile criminal prosecutions.However, after last week's attack in the center of Jakarta that killed eight people, including four militants, Indonesian security forces are raising concerns that more and deadlier attacks could follow, carried out by groups inspired by Islamic State.Indonesian Special Police patrol at Ngurah Rai Airport in Denpasar on Indonesia's resort island of Bali on Jan. 15, 2016, one day after a series of explosions hit the Indonesian capital Jakarta.The Jakarta attack was the first of its kind in Southeast Asia to be attributed to Syria-based militant Islamists.Authorities say about 500 Indonesians have travelled to the Middle East to join the extremist group. About 100 are believed to have returned, although experts say only about 15 have combat experience.Jakarta back to normalSo far the renewed threat of terrorism has not instilled any widespread sense of panic or fear amongst Indonesians.A security personnel stand guard inside train carriage for women at Manggarai train station in Jakarta, Jan. 8, 2016.Life in Jakarta has quickly returned to normal, less than a week after the deadly attacks.On Tuesday the Starbucks coffee shop that was bombed remained closed and boarded up for repairs, but the memorial of flowers had been removed. Other shops have reopened and traffic at the busy intersection was congested as usual.'Ojek' heroThe \u201cojek\u201d motorcycle taxi drivers were again gathered at the intersection where the attack took place, waiting for their next fares.One of the \u201cojek\u201d drivers back at work is Muhamad Yunus, who has received widespread praise for the selfless courage he exhibited during the attack.The militant attackers last Thursday (January 14) set off two bombs, the first at the Starbucks and the second at a police traffic station in the middle of the intersection, near Jakarta's oldest department store, Sarinah.After the second explosion Yunus rushed to the police station to help the wounded even though the assailants were shooting at anyone in the area. He said he found a woman whose legs were severely injured and brought her to safety, away from the firefight.\u201cI got that woman and I told her, don\u2019t cry. Please be strong. Be strong. Please don\u2019t be sad,\u201d Yunus said.Yunus said he found out later that the woman and her nephew were stopped by the police for a traffic violation at the time of the blast. Her nephew died in the explosion.Kami tidak takutAfter the Jakarta attack there have been demonstrations by Indonesian Muslims to denounce terrorism and call for the government to eradicate radical militants and supporters of Islamic State in the country.A \"Pray for Jakarta\" message (top) is displayed on a screen as Indonesians gather outside the damaged Starbucks coffee shop in central Jakarta on Jan. 17, 2016 following the deadly gun and bomb attacks that rocked the city on Jan. 14.Indonesians also have started to use hashtags like \"PrayforJakarta\" and \"Kamitidaktakut\" or \"Wearenotafraid\" in English, on social media.Yunus\u2019s act of heroism has been held up as an example of Indonesia\u2019s resolve to stand up against terrorism.\u201cI am not afraid. We won\u2019t be scared any more,\u201d he said.Dismantling terror networksMeanwhile Indonesian authorities have promised to intensify their efforts to monitor radical networks in the country.Police believe the alleged mastermind of the Jakarta attack, an Indonesian fighting with Islamic State in Syria called Bahrun Naim, used social media to communicate his radical ideas to followers in Indonesia.In December police say they successfully disrupted plans by militants to launch a string of deadly attacks on Christmas and New Year celebrations, as well as against the country's Shia Muslim minority.Prior to last week, the last major attack in the world's most populous Muslim nation was the twin bombing of luxury hotels in Jakarta in 2009.Ade Irma in Jakarta contributed to this

{"text": "To live in Ciudad Guayana is to know state-owned enterprise workers \u2014lots of them. With all the nationalized \u201cbasic industries\u201d around here, they\u2019re a normal part of daily life. So I called around some of the ones I know to ask about today\u2019s vote. The stories I heard were\u2026 remarkably similar.Jos\u00e9 at FerromineraAt Ferrominera, the big mining company in Guayana, workers are being forced to vote for the Constituent Assembly. The deal is simple: vote or you\u2019re fired. At each department, the manager is responsible for making sure his people vote.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get fired,\u201d he says. \u201cMy daughter is in the hospital.\u201dThere\u2019s nothing subtle about it. The order comes face-to-face, in notices and even via text message. Employees must go to meetings where the order is to vote. Nobody cares who they vote for \u2014this is a single party election, man. Managers are required to make lists with the ID numbers of the employees voting, and send them to human resources by Monday.Jos\u00e9 \u2014not his real name\u2014 has worked at Ferrominera for 15 years. \u201cThey make everyone vote, especially those in higher positions.\u201dJos\u00e9 isn\u2019t voting, though. He\u2019s not wealthy and he doesn\u2019t have a plan B if they fire him, but he\u2019s taking the chance.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get fired,\u201d he says. \u201cMy daughter is in the hospital, I guess my wife and I will go with her. I don\u2019t know.\u201dIn his office, where barely ten people work, everyone has agreed to boycott the election. But, he adds, many others are compelled out of fear.Maria\u2019s mom at PDVSAMartha \u2014like all names, changed for this story\u2014 wouldn\u2019t talk to me. I had to approach her daughter Mar\u00eda instead. She talked to me in secret, without telling her mom. \u201cI know her, there\u2019s no way she\u2019ll agree to an interview. She\u2019s too scared\u201d.She must report to her boss the exact voting center she went to, and the time she went at.Martha didn\u2019t go to the vote drill. Her boss harassed her and the other employees with constant texts, but there was only one voting center in Ciudad Guayana, and it was too far to consider it.For the real thing, the pressure is absurd. She must report to her boss the exact voting center she went to, and the time she went at. Martha will try a null vote. She\u2019s been in PDVSA for more than 20 years.Betania\u2019s dad at VenalumBetania\u2019s dad wouldn\u2019t talk to me (see a pattern?), but his daughter, an old friend, told me what he told the family. Her dad has been working for the big aluminum-maker way before chavismo was a thing: 25 years total.I just wish they burn all of the voting machines, so no one can vote. I hate this fucking government with all my soul.On Sunday, workers are being told to go to the plant first thing. They\u2019ll be put on buses to the voting centers. Managers are responsible for making sure the workers participate, and have lists saying where each worker votes. They must show up in the company\u2019s uniform too \u2014for the picture.Betania\u2019s dad is determined to vote. He has to protect his job; he\u2019s about to retire, he won\u2019t risk it. His family thinks he should stay home today. \u201cHere, they\u2019ll block the road at 5 am\u201d Betania tells me, \u201cso he might not be able to leave. We want him to stay, something might happen on the way there.\u201dShe catches her thoughts.\u201cI just wish they burn all of the voting machines, so no one can vote. I hate this fucking government with all my soul.\u201dJorge in the ArmyMilitary officers are forced to vote, just like any other state worker. As soldiers, they have to follow orders, or face trial by insubordination.I wish I could reveal more about my guy, but he wouldn\u2019t let me. He\u2019s a military officer and it\u2019s from el interior. He doesn\u2019t want to vote, and his plan is to show up, say hi and walk out. By showing himself, he thinks, he\u2019ll be off the hook.I reached out to people at two other state companies, but they refused to talk, even after I offered to change their names. The fear of dismissal makes getting the stories extremely hard, and look at the pattern I discovered: threats are explicit, demands are crystal clear and the workers? Extremely resentful of the position they\u2019ve been put in.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle burn <extra_id_0> Artifact machines <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destroyer they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle burn <extra_id_0> Artifact machines <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destroyer they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact called <extra_id_0> Participant some <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand forced <extra_id_0> Recipient workers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Guayana <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand making sure <extra_id_0> Recipient his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator manager <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand order  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand order <extra_id_0> Recipient Employees <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand required <extra_id_0> Recipient Managers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand make <extra_id_0> Communicator They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient everyone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce compelled <extra_id_0> Recipient others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact approach <extra_id_0> Participant Mar\u00eda <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact talked <extra_id_0> Participant me <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact report <extra_id_0> Participant her <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic voting center <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce harassed <extra_id_0> Communicator Her <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient employees <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact report <extra_id_0> Participant her <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic voting center <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant family <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant me <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand told <extra_id_0> Recipient workers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation put <extra_id_0> Vehicle buses <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination centers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand making sure <extra_id_0> Communicator Managers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient workers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce forced <extra_id_0> Recipient officers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce orders <extra_id_0> Recipient they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reached out <extra_id_0> Participant I <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> EndPosition fire <extra_id_0> Employee him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "'Pure Carnage' Recalled at Boston Marathon TrialA survivor of the deadly 2013 Boston Marathon bombings Thursday described the moments after the attack as \"pure carnage.\"Race spectator Jeff Bauman, who lost both legs in the explosions near the finish line of the race, testified on the second day of the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in a Boston courthouse.Bauman hobbled to the witness stand on prosthetic legs, then told the jury that he bumped into Tsarnaev's older brother Tamerlan along the race course moments before the blasts killed three people and injured another 264.Defense lawyers sought Thursday to limit graphic testimony of the bombing victims, but Judge George O'Toole ruled the jury should hear witness descriptions of the aftermath of the attack.Prosecutors allege the Tsarnaevs were trying to avenge U.S. wars in Muslim countries. By blaming the older brother, defense lawyers hope to convince the jury to not sentence Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyer, Judy Clarke, told the jury Wednesday the 21-year-old native Chechen participated with Tamerlan in setting off the bombs, but said Tamerlan masterminded the plot and deeply influenced his brother to take part in it. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev inadvertently killed his brother, running over him with a car, as they attempted to elude police days after authorities had identified them as suspects in the bombings.In his testimony, Bauman said he thought Tamerlan looked \"very suspicious. He was alone ... was not watching the race. He was not having fun.\"Bauman said he noticed an unattended bag that hid one of the two home-made pressure cooker bombs that defense attorneys acknowledge the Tsarnaev brothers detonated.After the blasts, Bauman, at the race to watch his future wife run, said, \"I looked down and saw my legs. It was pure carnage ... I could see my bones and flesh sticking out.\"He later described Tamerlan Tsarnaev for authorities as they began to search for bombing suspects.Protester outside the John Joseph Moakley federal courthouse where trial for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is being held, Boston, Massachusetts, March 5, 2015. (CarolynPresutti/VOA)Wednesday, jurors heard testimony from three other survivors of the bombing who were severely wounded in the attack \u2014 two of whom each lost a leg.\"My bones were literally laying next to me on the sidewalk,\" said 27-year-old survivor Rebekah Gregory, who also suffered multiple shrapnel injuries to one of her arms.Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to the 30 counts against him, including the fatal shooting of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer days after the bombings as the Tsarnaevs tried to flee.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his late brother are ethnic Chechens who had lived in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and the volatile Dagestan region of Russia before coming to the U.S. with their parents and two sisters about a decade before the bombings.Some information for this report comes from AP, AFP and Reuters.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact described <extra_id_0> Participant survivor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure lost <extra_id_0> Victim who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosions  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing trial <extra_id_0> Defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place courthouse <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant jury <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 264 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand ruled <extra_id_0> Communicator George O'Toole <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient jury <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact allege <extra_id_0> Participant Prosecutors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Tsarnaevs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentence <extra_id_0> Defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt jury <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact convince <extra_id_0> Participant jury <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant jury <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Chechen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack setting off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Chechen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand influenced <extra_id_0> Recipient brother <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator Tamerlan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim brother <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation elude  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize identified <extra_id_0> Identifier authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject them <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifiedRole suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Bauman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Tamerlan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Bauman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker brothers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact acknowledge <extra_id_0> Participant attorneys <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime search <extra_id_0> Investigator they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing trial <extra_id_0> Defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Victim who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flee <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Tsarnaevs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation coming <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact brother <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination U.S. <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The owner of a body shop and truck rental agency in Junction City, Kan., identified Timothy McVeigh in court Friday as the man who rented the Ryder truck used in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building.\"I was looking right at him,\" declared Eldon Elliott, owner of Elliott's Body Shop, recalling the two occasions when McVeigh, now 29, entered his shop--on April 15, 1995, to reserve a truck and pay the $280.32 rental fee in advance; and on April 17 to pick up the 20-foot Ryder truck. He said McVeigh used the name \"Robert Kling.\"\"That's the way I look at everybody,\" he told jurors and U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch. \"I look at them right square in the face.\"\"Is there any doubt in your mind?\" asked Justice Department prosecutor Scott Mendeloff.\"No,\" Elliott replied.\"Who was it?\" Mendeloff asked.\"Timothy McVeigh,\" Elliott said.Asked to point him out, Elliott gestured to the defense table. \"Right over there. Blue shirt.\"McVeigh sat stone-faced, wearing a blue oxford shirt with long sleeves rolled up. He did not acknowledge Elliott's identification.The testimony came on a day when prosecutors presented a series of witnesses and documents, including telephone records, a taxi log and a Chinese food takeout order, as well as surveillance photos from a McDonald's restaurant, to trace McVeigh's movements from April 14, 1995, when prosecutors say he arrived in Junction City, until April 17, when the Ryder truck was driven from Elliott's shop around 4:30 p.m.The Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was shattered by an explosion at 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and injuring more than 500 others.McVeigh is on trial on charges of murder and conspiracy.Prosecutors claim McVeigh arrived in Junction City on April 14, where he sold his car and purchased a yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis. He allegedly walked to the J and K bus depot where he called Elliott's to obtain a price quote on a Ryder truck rental.According to testimony, McVeigh checked into the Dreamland Motel later that day and stayed until the 17th.Prosecutors say he drove the truck to Geary Lake in Kansas, that 4,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate laced with nitromethane were loaded into the truck there, and that it was driven to Oklahoma City and detonated.Elliott testified that on April 15, McVeigh came to the body shop and reserved the truck, to be picked up at 4 p.m. two days later.Elliott said that McVeigh gave him the $280.32 in exact change after declining to pay an additional amount for insurance. He rented the truck using a driver's license in the name of \"Robert Kling\" that showed an address in Redfield, S.D., Elliott said.To piece together McVeigh's movements, prosecutors called Yuhua Bai, owner of Hunam Palace, in Junction City, who testified that shortly after 5 p.m. on April 15 she took a phone order for moo goo gai pan and egg rolls from a caller who gave the name \"Kling\" and requested delivery to Room 25 at the Dreamland. According to previous testimony, McVeigh was assigned Room 25.Phone records indicated were shown to the jury indicating that a call was made from that room to the Hunam Palace at 5:17 p.m. on the 15th.Prosecutors also called David D'Albini, manager of the McDonald's at the time, who narrated surveillance photographs taken in the restaurant April 17.Watching a TV monitor, jurors saw McVeigh, clad in a plaid shirt and jeans, approach the counter and later walk out of the restaurant.The video, which carried a date and time stamp, showed him leaving the restaurant at 3:57 p.m.", "event":

{"text": "Pressure Cookers, Nails, BBs, and Bags: What We Know About the Boston BombsMore StoriesThe 140-Year-Old Dream of \u2018Government Without Taxation\u2019The Media Barely Covered One of the Worst Storms to Hit U.S. SoilFrance\u2019s Jews Look to Pittsburgh \u2018Across a Narrow Bridge\u2019There were only two bombsIn the hours following the explosions, an array of outlets \u2014 including the Associated Press,TheWall Street Journal, andThe New York Times\u2014 quoted anonymous law enforcement officials who said that police had discovered three and even five additional, unexploded devices around the Boston area.The reports emerged around the same time that, as first reported byThe Boston Globe, a bomb squad arranged and detonated a \"controlled explosion\" on Boylston Street, just east of the first two explosions, in order to destroy a cache of \"suspicious packages\" that officials had come across.A similar scene played out in the Boston suburb of Newton, where a bomb squad used a robot to investigate a suspicious object that turned to be a circuit board.Monday night, theJournalquoted law enforcement officials as saying there had been five devices, then updated its report to clarify that \"investigators now doubt the devices were bombs.\"But during Tuesday morning's press conference, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick announced that law enforcement agents had not in fact discovered any other bombs.\"It's important to clarify that two and only two explosive devices were found yesterday.Other parcels have been examined ... but there were no unexploded bombs,\" he told reporters.The bombs may have been based in pressure cookersA representative of Boston Children's Hospital said at Tuesday afternoon press briefing that children being treated for injuries \"had BBs and nails embedded in their bodies,\" which were presumably packed into or around the bombs in order to maximize damage.(Massachusetts Congressman Stephen Lynch, reiterating what doctors at multiple hospitals had reported at briefings of their own Monday night, told Yahoo News that many victims were struck by what appeared to be metal ball bearings.)The exact design of the bombs, of course, remains unclear.Citing an unnamed source familiar with the investigation, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday morning that investigators, upon recovering pieces of the exploded bombs, determined that they were made of 6-liter pressure cookers, which were packed with ball bearings and metal nails and stuffed into \"black duffel bags.\"(CNN described them as \"backpacks\".)On Tuesday afternoon this information was reported by multiple outlets speaking to sources with knowledge of the Boston investigation.This is what your average pressure cooker looks like:It's a metal container used to quickly cook food using trapped steam.(The cooker's contents are heated using a stove or a built-in heating element, in the case of electric models.)You can buy one pretty much anywhere.For these reasons it makes an attractive container (to terrible, violent people) for holding, transporting, and detonating explosive materials.\"Terrorists use pressure cookers as IED containers for 2 main reasons,\" Israeli journalist Elizabeth Tsurkov explained via Twitter on Tuesday afternoon.\"The pressure cooker increases the pressure of the explosion gasses [and] and because the metal casings becomes deadly fragmentation upon detonation.\"Indeed, there's a long history of terrorists employing pressure cookers abroad.On Tuesday morningTime's Michael Crowley surfaced a 2004 memo issued by the Department of Homeland Security, cataloging episodes in which Afghan terrorists used pressure cookers to fabricate explosive devices and detonated them in several countries throughout the 2000s.(Such contraptions are especially prevalent in contested regions of Pakistan.)American soil is no stranger to these contraptions, either.The foiled terrorist plot to detonate a bomb in Times Square on May 1, 2010, involved a pressure cooker.Indeed, nobody in law enforcement or government is making any public connections to any groups or places right now.A Saudi man reported to be a \"person of interest\" has been cleared as a suspect.As President Obama said at the White House Tuesday: \"What we don't yet know, however, is who carried out this attack, or why; whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic, or was the act of a malevolent individual.That's what we don't yet know.And clearly, we're at the beginning of our investigation.\"In a post expanding on the memo,Time's Crowley noted the ease of creating such an explosive device.\"The ability to make these bombs is hardly unique to al Qaeda and its sympathizers.Details on how to make a pressure cooker bomb can also be found on websites associated with anarchy and other forms of non-religious radicalism,\" he said, before linking to such a website.Other evidence suggests that the bombs were made with readily-available chemicals.New Scientistasked a bomb expert to study the footage of the explosion for clues of the bombs origin.Here's what the expert concluded: \"The Boston bombs ... produced an orange flash followed by white smoke.This suggests the bombs contained neither TNT nor RDX, which produce black smoke, but could have been a home-made chlorate-based device.\"Update, 5:04 p.m.:ABC News is reporting that one of the bombs used gunpowder to detonate.It's unclear how the bombs detonatedIn the same report detailing how the bombs were built, the Associated Press notes, \"law enforcement officials have some of the bomb components but [do] not yet know what was used to set off the explosives.\"In that vacuum of knowledge a number of rumors have appeared: 1) the bombs used a timer; 2) the bombs were activated remotely; 3) cell phone service was shut down in downtown Boston to avert other remotely-activated bombs; and 4) a mysterious roof-top figure captured in a single photo hassomethingto do with setting off the bomb.Rumor No.1 appears to be the strongest.After speaking to an official close to the investigation, CNN knocked down rumors (discussed below) that the bomb had been detonated using a cell phone-activated trigger, and reported that investigators in Boston think the bombs had timers attached to them instead.And, within minutes of CNN's report, theGlobereported that investigators had turned up a circuit board they believe was used to trigger the explosions; it was reportedly found near a spot where Gov.Patrick had been seated earlier in the day.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack explosions  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection discovered <extra_id_0> Observer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity devices <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> Place Boylston Street <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker squad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle destroy <extra_id_0> Place Boylston Street <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destroyer squad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact cache <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection investigate <extra_id_0> Instrument a robot <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity a circuit board <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Observer squad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize investigate <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject object <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifiedRole a circuit board <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Identifier squad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact announced <extra_id_0> Communicator Deval Patrick <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic any other bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place press conference <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact saying <extra_id_0> Topic devices <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection examined  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Intervention treated <extra_id_0> Patient children <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Treater Boston Children's Hospital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator representative <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic children <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Communicator Stephen Lynch <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Yahoo News <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic bearings <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble made <extra_id_0> Artifact the exploded bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components metal nails <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize cataloging <extra_id_0> Identifier Department of Homeland Security <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble fabricate <extra_id_0> Artifact explosive devices <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components pressure cookers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler terrorists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice them <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker terrorists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place countries <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonate <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Times Square <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker terrorist <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Acquit cleared <extra_id_0> Defendant man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator our <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble made <extra_id_0> Artifact the bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components readily-available chemicals <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime study <extra_id_0> Investigator expert <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonate <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice the bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble built <extra_id_0> Artifact the bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack trigger <extra_id_0> Instrument circuit board <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "1973: IRA gang convicted of London bombingsSix men and two women have been convicted of exploding two IRA car bombs in London in March this year.All eight were active members of the Provisional IRA.A ninth defendant, 18-year-old Roisin McNearney, was acquitted.One person died and almost 200 were injured in the two bombs. One blew up outside the Old Bailey criminal court, while the other went off outside Scotland Yard.Strict securityThe 10-week trial at Winchester Crown Court has seen some of the strictest security precautions in British legal history.The court was heavily guarded throughout, and as the verdict was delivered, four rows of plain-clothes detectives sat bethind the dock and at least 15 prison officers surrounded the defendants. All doors to the court were bolted.First, the jury returned a not-guilty verdict on Roisin McNearney, a known IRA activist who is believed to have helped the police identify the other conspirators.As her verdict was handed down, the other defendants began to hum the Dead March from Saul, and one threw a coin at her, shouting \"Take your blood money with you\" as she left the dock in tears.A number of threats have already been made to members of her family and she has said she is unlikely ever to be able to return to her native Belfast.'Murderous enterprises'As the eight guilty defendants were led to the cells below the court several gave clenched fist salutes to relatives and friends in the public gallery, who shouted \"Keep your chins up\" and \"All the best\".The judge then addressed Miss McNearney, saying, \"You have learned a bitter lesson and I hope it has taught you and others like you not to dabble in murderous enterprises.\"He then ordered that she be given police protection.The two women defendants, Dolours and Marian Price, were believed to have played the most important role in the conspiracy, along with a third defendant, Hugh Feeney. All three were student teachers in Belfast.The other conspirators were Gerald Kelly, 19; Robert Walsh, 24; Martin Brady, 22; William Armstrong, 29, and Paul Holmes, 19, all from Belfast.A tenth person, William McLarnon, 19, left the dock on the first day of the trial after pleading guilty to all charges.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Place London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant women <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploding <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Acquit acquitted <extra_id_0> Defendant defendant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim person <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 200 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice One <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack went <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice other <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Scotland Yard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict verdict <extra_id_0> Defendant her <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime conspiracy <extra_id_0> Perpetrator Marian Price <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Latest news straight to your inbox Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Invalid EmailThe second Birmingham pub bombings pre-inquest review takes place this week. Andy Richards reveals for the first time the tragic story of young victim Marilyn Paula Nash.An early riser for work, council worker John Smith needed to be on autopilot as he set off as usual on the grey, dismal Friday morning that is forever etched in his memory.Normally, he would have had a spring in his step. After all, all the weekend was beckoning. It was a chance for him to unwind from the office graft, and perhaps enjoy a drink or two.But this wasn\u2019t a normal morning. In fact, there had never been another morning quite like it in the West Midlands.The previous night, well, at that stage all the terrible details were not known. Accounts varied, the death toll was rising.Bombers \u2013 everyone knew they were the IRA, although the terror group had not claimed responsibility \u2013 had destroyed two pubs in Birmingham city centre.Nineteen people were dead, several were clinging to life, two of whom would eventually succumb to dreadful injuries.The number of injured seemed to change with almost every news bulletin, but it was steadily increasing, and by now it was more than 150.On the previous night \u2013 November 21, 1974 \u2013 families across the UK had clustered around TV sets and radios, utterly aghast and trying to take in what the news flashes from Birmingham were showing and describing.In the city, and across the Black Country towns of West Bromwich, Dudley, Walsall and Wolverhampton, fear of more attacks, combined with growing anger, was visceral.There had already been a number of reprisal attacks on Irish homes and businesses. The region bristled with tension.John\u2019s head was already full of this as he fastened his coat to leave his Walsall home. Little did he know that the sickening horror of the previous night was on his own doorstep.He stepped out... and into a nightmare scenario.John, now a 74-year-old pensioner and still living in the same terraced property, knows the memories can never be erased.\u201cIt must have been about 7am,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had all heard about the bombs going off in the pubs in Birmingham the night before. The whole area was in shock, people could hardly believe it.\u201dIn his early 30s at the time, on that Friday morning he was intent on catching his usual bus for the daily journey to work at Lichfield Council where he was involved in planning sewerage pipe developments.As he set off from the small close in Pelsall where his family lived, he was confronted by the extraordinary sight of his neighbour, Mr Nash stumbling about in the road \u201clike a lost man\u201d.John remembers his neighbour\u2019s tears and his face \u2013 the face of a man in absolute torment.\u201cHe was simply wandering about, not going anywhere but obviously really upset,\u201d recalls John. \u201cSo naturally I went to him and asked him what was wrong.\u201cHe said his daughter, Marilyn, had been in Birmingham the night before. She still hadn\u2019t come home.\u201dMr Nash was a widower and lived with Marilyn, who was 22, and his son, Robert, in the terraced house next door. John thinks Robert was away studying at university at the time. Either way, there was no-one else at home.With nobody to talk to, Mr Nash\u2019s agony had multiplied with each long hour throughout the blackest of nights.\u201cI tried to comfort him as best I could, but what can you do? What can you say?,\u201d says John. \u201cHis daughter should have been home hours ago. There had been no sign or word of her.\u201cI persuaded him to come back to our house where I left him with my mother before I went on to work. She did her best to help him.\u201dWhatever conversation passed between John\u2019s mother and Mr Nash is not known. Neither is how long the poor man waited for news.But his fears for his daughter were sadly well-founded. She never did come home.It took the authorities some time to confirm that Birmingham shop worker Marilyn Paula Nash \u2013 known as Paula to her family and close friends \u2013 was among the dead.She was an attractive, vivacious young woman, with a hint of Jackie Onassis about her looks and hairstyle.Those tasked with the dreadful job of identifying the dead could only confirm it was her by her wage packet, says John.\u201cI remember that she was a very sweet, very friendly girl,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe was my next door neighbour and a reasonably similar age so, although were were not close, we would always say hello, and pass the time of day. Sometimes we would catch the same bus if we were going into Birmingham for a drink, and we would chat.\u201dA fateful decision by Marilyn to pop into a pub for a quick drink on the way home from work cost her her life.It was the penultimate pay day before Christmas. The pubs in Birmingham were full and business was brisk. Marilyn headed for the Tavern In The Town, the underground bar in New Street which had become a cult drinking hole for students and young workers.So did the bombers. They wrought carnage there, and at the nearby Mulberry Bush at the bottom of The Rotunda.\u201cWhen it became known that Marilyn was among the dead, this whole area was in absolute shock,\u201d remembers John. \u201cThere was a big Irish community locally and a local Catholic club was nearby.\u201cI remember the police ordering the Catholic club to be closed for security reasons for a time. I don\u2019t think that was necessary, but I suppose they feared reprisals or trouble and had to be careful.\u201dMr Nash, who later remarried, is understood to have passed away many years ago, and Marilyn\u2019s brother is believed to live in another part of the country.John is probably the only resident from those days still living in the small, tidy street that witnessed such awful events.The homes there are well-kept but nowadays many have signs in their windows making it clear that callers without appointments are not welcome.It suggests the residents prefer keep themselves to themselves.Most probably have no idea of the tragedy that visited the Nash family 42 years ago.(Image: Wesley/Keystone/Getty Images)As for John, his chat with me has clearly stirred recollections that have lay dormant for many years.But he is not optimistic that the new inquest will bring truth or closure to those who still grieve.\u201cLike a good many others I would like to know what really went on that night but...\u201d and here he pauses.\u201cIt may turn something up, but those who did it have got away with it for too long.\u201dEx-IRA chief: Pub attacks left me ashamed and appalled...(Image: Birmingham Mail)The IRA\u2019s involvement in the bombings became clearer with the publication of the memoirs of Kieran Conway, head of the its intelligence-gathering department during the 1970s.In his book Southside Provisional, he confessed that the attacks on the pubs left him \u201cashamed and appalled.\u201dThe attacks on the Birmingham pubs, neither of which had any military connection, \u201cwent against everything we claimed to stand for,\u201d he said.The bombings came after police disrupted the funeral arrangements for James McDade, a lieutenant in the Birmingham Brigade of the IRA who blew himself up while trying to attack Coventry Telephone Exchange a few days earlier.\u201cTempers were high and I, for one, certainly at first feared that the local IRA had knowingly caused these dreadful casualties,\u201d said Conway.He claimed the IRA unit responsible \u201ccould not find a functioning telephone box, so they were unable to issue a warning sufficiently in time to clear the bars and prevent the mass loss of life.\u201dConway finally left the Republican movement in 1993 and is now a criminal lawyer in Dublin.Fighting families\u2019 legal aid problems still to be resolvedRelatives of more than half the victims are hoping to be represented by lawyers at the pre-inquest review hearing on Thursday.But at the time of going to press, longstanding issues of legal aid had still to be resolved.For several months the Government had insisted that KRW Law, the Belfast-based law firm representing most of the families, was not eligible for legal aid.But at the end of last month, there was a U-turn and the Legal Aid Agency is currently considering a fresh application.Legal Aid Minister Sir Oliver Heald QC said: \u201cIt would be a travesty for families to be denied justice simply because of a technicality, which is why I have taken the decision to change the regulations around inquest funding. This will remove any barrier from the families\u2019 solicitors in applying for legal aid funding for the inquest.\u201dThe inquest was re-opened in June last year following a campaign by the families, backed by the Birmingham Mail. The full inquest is expected to take place in September.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Target pub <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack destroyed <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Bombers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure were <extra_id_0> Victim several <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die injuries <extra_id_0> Victim two <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Infect injured <extra_id_0> Victim 150 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target homes <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack going off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim Marilyn Paula Nash <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact says <extra_id_0> Participant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact asked <extra_id_0> Participant I <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact says <extra_id_0> Participant John <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact persuaded <extra_id_0> Participant him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact recalls <extra_id_0> Participant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact says <extra_id_0> Participant John <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact remembers <extra_id_0> Participant John <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact chat <extra_id_0> Participant me <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target Pub <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack came  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew <extra_id_0> Attacker James McDade <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Coventry Telephone Exchange <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Conway <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> StartPosition is <extra_id_0> Employee Conway <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PlaceOfEmployment Dublin <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Oliver Heald QC <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Boston Turns Street into Memorial for Bombing VictimsBostonians have transformed the Boston Marathon finish line area into a memorial for the victims of this month's twin bombings.Dozens of people gathered at Boylston Street to lay flowers and display messages of hope for the victims.The memorial includes some of the same guard rails used during the April 15 marathon. Some people tied American flags to the rails and placed dozens of running shoes to show their support. Paper doves tied to nearby trees moved softly in the breeze.On Friday, the U.S. Marshals Service said Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was moved to a prison medical facility as authorities continued to search for information about the attack. The bombings killed three people and injured more than 250 others.Tsarnaev was moved to Federal Medical Center Devens from a Boston hospital, where he had been treated for injuries sustained during his capture last week.A spokesman did not give details about the condition of the 19-year-old, who officials say is recovering from a neck wound.Tsarnaev's brother and alleged co-conspirator, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died in a confrontation with police last week.Also Friday, FBI agents searched for a laptop computer that is believed to belong to Dzhokar Tsarnaev. Agents in white hazmat suits scoured a landfill near the campus of the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, where Dzhokar was a student.In Washington, lawmakers said authorities are trying to determine whether or not the brothers' mother was involved in the radicalization of her two sons. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Dutch Ruppersberger, said she is a \"person of interest.\"The Associated Press reported Friday that the bombing suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, had been added to a federal terrorism database about 18 months before the Boston attack. She has denied her sons were involvement and has even suggested the bombing could have been staged.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev faces a charge of using a weapon of mass destruction, which carries a possible death sentence if he is convicted.New York officials say the suspects were devising a plan to attack Times Square as they were running from authorities. New York Police Chief Ray Kelly says Dzhokhar told investigators they planned to drive to New York to set off their remaining explosives.He says the plan fell apart when they realized the vehicle they had hijacked was running low on gas. When they stopped to refuel, the driver of the car escaped, and alerted police to their location.U.S. investigators questioned the suspects' parents in the Russian republic of Dagestan to try to determine if Tamerlan had contacts with Islamic extremists. The family is originally from Chechnya, where Muslim insurgents have for decades been engaged in a bloody conflict with Russia.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Transportation moved <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination prison medical facility <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Infect injured <extra_id_0> Victim others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation moved <extra_id_0> Destination Federal Medical Center Devens <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin hospital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charge <extra_id_0> Defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bloody conflict <extra_id_0> Attacker insurgents <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Russia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection searched <extra_id_0> Observer agents <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity laptop computer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Associated Press <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

Their goal was to capture him and put him on trial.Two weeks ago, when Maduro was speaking at a military parade in Caracas, drones packed with plastic explosives detonated nearby in a failed assassination attempt. A participant in the April Bogota meeting said in an interview that he believes the people his group met with were the perpetrators.InfiltratedHis group, which included members of all four armed-service branches, was later infiltrated by the Venezuelan security services. Several dozen were arrested, breaking up the most serious attempt to overthrow Maduro in his five years in office. The plan was called Operation Constitution. The man remains abroad.His theory about who was behind the drone attack is one of several clues emerging about the perpetrators of the Aug. 4 assault.The government also knows some things about the plotters. It says their financier is Osman Delgado, a Venezuelan living in Miami who is linked to a 2017 attack on a military base. Delgado couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.The government has released audio recordings of what seem to be the attackers on the day of the assassination attempt. The recordings reveal a chaotic group bickering and scolding one another for failing to report in or not speaking loudly enough or announcing that the military ceremony being attacked was underway.Security forces check a building after an explosion during the ceremony on Aug. 4.

Later, another demands the status of the rest of the group after one drone is airborne. \u201cUpdates please. Say something! Everything is quiet!\u201d she is heard to say.The government appears to be using the plot to pursue political opponents who may have nothing to do with it, an approach it has used in the past. It has at times arrested opponents and accused them of sabotage as the economy and basic services have collapsed. In the past, the plots were mostly invented for political purposes; now they\u2019re increasingly real.In the past two weeks, the government has announced the arrests of two high-ranking national guardsmen, a congressman and almost a dozen other people, many younger than 30.The Venezuelan Justice Organization, a human-rights watchdog, says there are currently about 150 servicemen and women behind bars.Soldiers in T-ShirtsOne group claiming responsibility for this month\u2019s attempt is a network of online activists called Soldados de Franela, or Soldiers in T-Shirts, named after the way street protesters hide their faces. The escaped plotter, however, doesn\u2019t think they are the people he met with in Bogota.What is clear is the depth of despair spreading across Venezuela as it descends into a lawless failed state where crime is rampant, those who can are leaving and hunger gnaws away at many of the nation\u2019s remaining 30 million inhabitants. For at least a year, there have been multiple small-scale rebellions, largely unconnected.Officials say as many 34 people, including opposition leaders and former student protesters, conspired in the drone attack. The president was unharmed, but much of the country watched on live television as hundreds of soldiers scattered following the off-camera explosions, deeply embarrassing the government.Juan Requesens Source: AFP TV/AFP via Getty ImagesAmong the detainees are a general and colonel of the national guard and the congressmen, Juan Requesens. He has been charged with attempted homicide and treason. The government has released a video of Requesens, 29, that shows him apparently answering an interrogator and acknowledging participating in the plot. His party says he was coerced and drugged. Another video his supporters leaked shows him in a state of ruin, almost naked in what appears to be soiled underwear.20 More SuspectsAuthorities are now seeking an additional 20 suspects, including a lawmaker in exile, who are at large across Latin America and in the U.S.The government has named as one of the leaders Julio Borges, the former head of Venezuela\u2019s opposition-led congress, who fled to Colombia earlier this year. Borges has denied involvement and said the attacks were perpetrated from within the government\u2019s own ranks.Soldiers in T-Shirts formed following a wave of anti-government unrest in 2014. Its website and social-media accounts have been popular among demonstrators and resistance groups for updates on protests and news critical of the government.In 2017, Soldiers in T-Shirts began disseminating messages and videos of Oscar Perez, an elite police officer who commandeered a helicopter and called upon Venezuelans to rise up against the government. Security forces killed him in January in an hours-long shootout that was, in part, broadcast across social media.One of the Soldiers in T-Shirts leaders, who gave his name as Gregory, confirmed Perez\u2019s death the day of the raid in an interview with CNN en Espanol. Whatever their role in the most recent attack, he said, the group is growing.\u201cThis is not a defeat,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government wants to view it as a trophy, but there are more of us.

{"text": "Mariana Zu\u00f1igaSpecial for USA TODAYCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Venezuelan election officials said 8 million people voted Sunday to create a constitutional assembly endowing President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro with virtually unlimited powers, a vote total decried by domestic and foreign critics as a sham.Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council's estimated turnout Sunday was more than double that of political opponents and independent experts.Opposition leaders also said 12 people were killed in violence in the face of a massive presence of troops around the country on Sunday. The government confirmed nine deaths.Maduro, who faces a worsening economic crisis despite Venezuela's enormous oil reserves, seeks to establish a friendly assembly that would bypass the opposition-controlled Congress to rewrite the country\u2019s 1999 constitution. Opponents accuse him of trying to create a single-party, authoritarian system like that in Cuba.Electoral Council President Tibisay Lucena announced just before midnight Sunday that turnout was 41.53%, or 8,089,320 people.The count was met with mockery and anger from members of the opposition, who said they believed between 2 million and 3 million people voted.Julio Borges, president of the opposition-led National Assembly, said only 7% of the electorate had voted \u2014 a silent protest of Maduro's power grab, which would slam the brakes on democracy.The opposition had urged voters to boycott the vote, but millions of Venezuelans who hold government jobs were ordered to cast ballots or risk being fired.Others feared loss of social benefits like subsidized food. \u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m hoping for housing,\u201d admitted hairdresser Luisa Marquez, 46, as she waited in line to vote.Opinion polls had indicated that more than two-thirds of the nation opposed the president's move. The opposition said 7 million had voted against constitutional changes in a referendum it had organized a week ago.A midday check of 10 polling places here in the capital Sunday showed most of them empty or nearly empty.\u201cVenezuela has screamed with its silence,\u201d said Borges, who put the day's death toll at 12. The public prosecutor's office confirmed nine deaths.Maduro's vision of a new constitution to consolidate his power has drawn ire in Washington. Last week, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on 13 senior Venezuelan officials, and the White House and some U.S. lawmakers said stiffer sanctions could follow. Mexico said it would support U.S. sanctions, and the Organization of American States and the European Parliament have also expressed support for the opposition.Late Sunday, the U.S. State Department officially condemned the Venezuelan government for holding the vote, saying Maduro's bid to consolidate power would \u201cundermine the Venezuelan people\u2019s right to self-determination.\u201dU.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has called the vote a \u201csham election.\u201dIn Venezuela, opposition leaders refused to put up candidates, arguing that the election has been structured to ensure that Maduro\u2019s ruling socialist party dominates. Thus virtually all the more than 5,000 candidates for 545 assembly seats are Maduro supporters.The opposition vowed to protest despite a ban on public gatherings issued by Maduro. In some parts of the capital, people took to the streets in protest against the vote, but they were soon repelled by security forces throwing tear gas.During a protest, opposition supporters set an explosive that injured seven police officers, the public prosecutor's office said. After the blast, police set fire to four motorcycles belonging to journalists.Read more:After months of fatal protests, Venezuela braces for controversial vote SundayWhy this vote in Venezuela is so importantMaduro has struggled with a rapidly deteriorating economy and strengthening political opposition. Some voters said they believed the new assembly might improve life in Venezuela.\u201cI\u2019m voting today because I want peace to be restored,\u201d said seamstress Carmen Martinez, 44. But she said she was less certain the assembly will solve the nation's economic ills.\"I\u2019m going to have hope, but I doubt this could solve that problem,\" she said.Months of violence leading up to the vote showed little signs of ending, with media reporting that a leading assembly candidate and an opposition activist were killed before voting even began.Jos\u00e9 Felix Pineda, a lawyer running in the election, was shot in his home Saturday night, a senior Venezuelan minister told the BBC.Maduro has denied links to violent paramilitaries that have run roughshod across the country, blaming the opposition for unrelenting violence that has left more than 100 people dead.Maduro himself voted with little fanfare early in the morning.\u201cWe\u2019ve stoically withstood the terrorist, criminal violence,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully the world will respectfully extend its arms toward our country.\u201dOpposition leader Henrique Capriles called on Venezuelans to protest on Monday.Contributing: The Associated Press.

Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.Yet on Sunday, critics say, an authoritarian system long in the making will be formalized, reviving memories of an era that the region had hoped was over. In defiance of international warnings, the socialist government is pushing forward with a vote to elect a constituent assembly that will have the authority to change the 1999 constitution, supplant the opposition-controlled legislature and potentially keep Maduro in power indefinitely.The opposition on Thursday called for three days of massive, nationwide protests as the government showed no willingness to back down and following the slaying of seven more demonstrators in two days. Responding to the spiraling tensions, the U.S. State Department ordered the departure of family members of American staff at its embassy in Caracas. It also authorized voluntary departures for American staff, and issued a broad travel warning for U.S. citizens.Maduro \u2014 the anointed successor of firebrand leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who died in 2013 \u2014 strongly defends the new assembly, saying it will fortify what he hails as \u201cthe communal state.\u201d While it\u2019s unclear exactly what he is seeking in a new constitution, it would likely give more power to \u201ccommunal councils\u201d in poor neighborhoods. Leaders of those councils, critics say, are government loyalists who in practice would sideline elected politicians and win direct pipelines to government funds.On the surface, the assembly vote, along with the government\u2019s pseudo-Soviet speak, hark back to old-school Marxist regimes. But many here see something perhaps more sinister emerging \u2014 a 21st-century thugocracy that rules by coercion, extortion and violence.About 100 people have died in three months of anti-government street protests. Arrests of political activists have accelerated. Bands of pro-government toughs \u2014 known as colectivos \u2014 roam poor neighborhoods, waving guns, intimidating protesters and journalists, beating opposition politicians, and warning locals to toe the government line.[How a new kind of protest movement has arisen in Venezuela]More than 7 million people voted against the establishment of the new assembly in an informal referendum July 16. Opposition parties are boycotting the election.In a country where the government is the largest employer, state workers say they are being ordered to vote Sunday, at the risk of losing their jobs. HIV patients say officials have threatened to cut off their supplies of antiretroviral drugs if they do not turn out for the election. Families risk being scratched off government food distribution rosters for not showing up \u2014 a dire outcome in a country where a socialist experiment and economic mismanagement have sparked hyperinflation and food shortages.Such threats are not idle, either. Yanelis Banco, 36 years old and nearly nine months pregnant, said her boss at the government postal service called her in along with other department heads for a talk last week. He ordered them, she said, to sign a form pledging to vote Sunday.She and five other senior staffers refused. All of them lost their jobs, she said.\u201cI\u2019m a pregnant woman who has been working in the company for 10 years and four months, so I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d fire me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do I have to sign if I don\u2019t agree? I thought the law protected me!\u201dShe added: \u201cAll the other employees are terrified. Now they\u2019re sure that if they don\u2019t vote, they\u2019ll be fired. None of them can afford that.\u201d[Stuck in a death spiral, Venezuela is borrowing money at any cost]Maduro has acknowledged that the government is pressuring public employees to vote. At a rally with public energy workers this month, he said: \u201cTake the lists of workers from all the state institutions and businesses to create a constituent committee. For each business, call all the workers and organize how they\u2019ll vote on July 30th. At the end of the day, check the list. If there are 15,000 workers, there have to be 15,000 votes, with no excuses.\u201dVenezuela\u2019s political protests have been fueled by the disastrous state of the economy, growing authoritarian rule and the government\u2019s resistance to early elections. The country\u2019s electoral council ruled against the opposition when it sought a referendum in 2016 that could have cut short Maduro\u2019s six-year term. The council also pushed back elections for governors, scheduled for 2016, to December of this year. Critics fear that the new assembly will cancel those, as well as the presidential election in 2018.The U.S. Treasury Department in February froze Vice President Tareck El Aissami\u2019s American assets over his alleged involvement in narcotics trafficking and took similar action against eight justices of the pro-government supreme court after it tried to strip power from the opposition-led legislature. On Wednesday, the Trump administration targeted 13 more Venezuelan officials, alleging violations of human rights and corruption.[Trump administration hits 13 Venezuelans with sanctions in advance of vote]Once the richest country per capita in South America due to its vast oil reserves, Venezuela was also cursed with vast disparities that kept an elite in luxury while the poor languished in slums. The result was Ch\u00e1vez, who used the petroleum wealth to launch massive social programs, even as he concentrated power. He remains much beloved by millions of Venezuelans, although many others \u2014 especially in the middle and upper classes \u2014 loathe him.Maduro\u2019s approval rating, on the other hand, is hovering around 20 percent, with opponents calling this weekend\u2019s vote the only way for him to remain in the presidential palace.He has promised Venezuelans that the assembly will herald a new era of security and stability.\u201cJuly 30th will be the birth of a historic trigger of the homeland for a new phase of peace and advancement,\u201d Maduro told a campaign rally this week.Yet many Venezuelans fear just the opposite \u2014 a deepening of official repression. It is already starting, they say.Take, for instance, 51-year-old Lisbeth A\u00f1ez, or \u201cMama Lis.\u201d For years, she was known for aiding anti-government protesters, bringing them blankets and cooking them fresh arepas, or cornmeal cakes.In May, she was arrested and charged with treason.Her case is in the hands of a military tribunal. In recent months, scores of civilians who have taken part in demonstrations or other perceived anti-government acts have been sent into the military court system, where they can face lengthy prison sentences.\u201cI can\u2019t sleep, I can\u2019t eat, even if we had enough food,\u201d said her son, Luis Gonz\u00e1lez A\u00f1ez, 23, who said he was refused entry to her trial. \u201cI have nightmares, thinking about her in jail . . . I didn\u2019t think things could get worse, but they have.\u201dGabriela Ram\u00edrez, Venezuela\u2019s former public ombudsman and a longtime Ch\u00e1vez supporter, said she feared the government would become worse than a dictatorship. \u201cWe will have a narco-authoritarian regime,\u201d she said.Ram\u00edrez, who carries around a pocket version of Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s 1999 constitution in her purse, is among the ranks of former \u201cChavistas\u201d \u2014 or Ch\u00e1vez backers \u2014 who have turned against Maduro. She has paid for it with harassment, she said, including a recent hack in which intimate photos of her and her husband were leaked on social media.\u201cThere will no longer be any check on their power,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will control everything.\u201dFollowing an opposition-called 48-hour strike, the government on Thursday issued a ban on public gatherings and protests lasting from Friday through Tuesday. The opposition responded by calling for nationwide mobilization, asking citizens to take to the streets from the Caribbean Sea to the Andes Mountains.In an interview, Freddy Guevara, an opposition leader and vice president of the National Assembly, played down the chances of any deal to suspend or cancel the vote. Former Spanish prime minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero is in Caracas, and has served as an intermediary between the government and opposition. Guevara denied reports that a deal had been offered to suspend the vote.\u201cIt is wishful thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cI am sure they are going forward with this scam, and that we are going to respond with pressure.\u201dBut even leading members of the opposition appear to be losing hope that Maduro will back down.Scenarios for what happens next range widely. Some observers suggest that social unrest and international sanctions will worsen, prompting, perhaps, a military coup or fueling an anti-government guerrilla movement. Others say the government, likely with the aid of Russia and China, will somehow manage to hold on as the country becomes an international pariah.Still others see a worst-case scenario of social implosion and anarchy.\u201cSomalia,\u201d said Henrique Capriles, an opposition leader and governor of the state of Miranda.\u201cWe could become a failed state.\u201dMariana Zu\u00f1iga contributed to this report.Read moreThings are so bad in Venezuela that people are rationing toothpasteVenezuela\u2019s paradox: people are hungry, but farmers can\u2019t feed themMaduro wants to rewrite the constitution.

{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Two drones packed with explosives reportedly flew toward Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Saturday night in what the government has described as a failed assassination attempt.Here's a look at the details:What happened?Assailants launched two drones filled with a total of more than 4 pounds of plastic explosives toward Maduro, his wife and other top Venezuelan leaders, according to the Associated Press.The attack occurred while Maduro was making a speech at a huge outdoor event in Caracas to celebrate the 81st anniversary of the country's national guard. One of the drones was set to explode above the president while the second was set to detonate in front of him, according to Interior Minister Nestor Reverol.The Venezuelan military knocked one of the drones off-course electronically. The second drone crashed into an apartment building about two blocks from where Maduro was speaking to hundreds of troops, Reverol said.Photos taken at the event showed security officers surrounding Maduro with some sort of large black shields as they escorted him away.\"That drone came after me,\" Maduro said. \"But there was a shield of love that always protects us. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll live for many more years.\"Who launched the drone attack?The Venezuelan government alleges that Maduro's political opponents conspired with individuals in Miami and Bogota, Colombia, to try to kill Maduro. They have so far offered no real proof to support this claim, and opposition leaders charge that Maduro is using the attack as an excuse to crack down on his critics.Government authorities said Sunday that they have detained six people \u2013 whom they described as \"terrorists and assassins\" \u2013 in connection with the attack. Among those detained: a man who took part in 2014 protests against the government and a man who had a warrant out for his arrest for attacking a military barracks.Maduro accused the \u201cfar right,\u201d working with conspirators in Miami and Bogota \u2013including Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos \u2013 of launching the attack. Colombia\u2019s government has denied any role in the violence.Maduro, who accuses the U.S. of supporting his opponents, called on President Donald Trump to hold the \"terrorist group\" accountable.John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, said Sunday he would like to see solid evidence to support Maduro's claims.\"If the government of Venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of U.S. criminal law, we\u2019ll take a serious look at it,\" Bolton said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"What is the political and economic situation in Venezuela?Venezuela is in the midst of an economic crisis that has been described as worse than the Great Depression that devastated the United States and much of the rest of the world in the 1930s.The inflation rate is set to hit a stunning 13,000 percent this year. There are shortages of food and medicine and a soaring crime rate, spurring refugees to flee into neighboring countries. More than 600,000 Venezuelans have crossed into Colombia, and Brazil has declared a state of emergency because of all the Venezuelans sweeping into that nation.Maduro is viewed by the United States and other democratic countries as a corrupt, left-wing dictator who imposes strict controls on his people and on the press. He won re-election to a six-year term in May, but the process was widely viewed as a rigged farce.The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Venezuela immediately after the election in an effort to stop Maduro from selling off government debt to enrich himself.What could happen next?Reverol said there could be more arrests. Critics fear an even greater government crackdown on Maduro's political opponents.\"The investigation will get to the bottom of this,\" Maduro said. \"No matter who falls.\"More:Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says drone attack was 'attempt to kill me'More:Venezuelan opposition leaders taken from their homes by state security agents", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Crash crashed <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> CrashObject building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flew <extra_id_0> Vehicle drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation launched <extra_id_0> Transporter Assailants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact speech <extra_id_0> Communicator Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation escorted <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transporter they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack kill <extra_id_0> Target Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain detained <extra_id_0> Jailer authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee whom <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protests <extra_id_0> Topic the government <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrator who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacking <extra_id_0> Attacker who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target barracks <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassination  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand called <extra_id_0> Recipient Donald Trump <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flee <extra_id_0> Destination countries <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact refugees <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation crossed <extra_id_0> Destination Colombia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack kill <extra_id_0> Target me <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain taken <extra_id_0> Detainee opposition leaders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer state <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

Pine View High School in March 2018, St.George, Utah, April 24, 2019 | Photo by court pool, St.George NewsST.GEORGE \u2014 A judge sentenced a Hurricane teen who brought a homemade bomb to his high school last year to serve four years of \"intensely supervised\" probation Wednesday.Martin Farnsworth appears in 5th District Court via video conference for his initial appearance, St.George, Utah, July 31, 2018 | File photo via court pool, St.George NewsMartin Farnsworth, 17, appeared in 5thDistrict Court Wednesday afternoon where Judge Michael Westfall sentenced him to serve 48 months of supervised probation and 250 hours of community service, along with additional restrictions.Farnsworth had been facing a potential five years-to-life prison term that came with the first-degree felony charge of attempting to injure others with an incendiary device that he pleaded guilty to last month as a part of a plea deal.Prior to taking the plea, Farnsworth faced felony charges for attempted murder and possession of a weapon of mass destruction.The case was originally set in juvenile court last year but was moved to 5th District Court where he was tried as an adult due to the severity of the incident involved.Read more: Judge: 16-year-old who brought bomb to Pine View High School will be tried as adultThe charges stem from a March 5, 2018 incident in which Farnsworth took a homemade explosive to Pine View High School.He placed the would-be incendiary device in a backpack in the cafeteria area during lunch and left after lighting a fuse.At the time, the cafeteria contained between 75-150 students.Pine View High School students are evacuated to the football field as police investigate a bomb scare inside the school and swept the parking lot as a precaution, St.George, Utah, March 5, 2018 | File photo by Mori Kessler, St.George NewsStudents noticed smoke coming from the backpack that contained the device and reported it to school faculty and the school\u2019s resource officer, triggering an evacuation of the school and a multi-agency response from law enforcement.While the incendiary device\u2019s fuse fizzled out and failed to ignite, investigators determined that if it had gone off, it would have caused damage to the immediate area and injured those near it.The device was constructed out of a \"metal soup can filled with metal BB shots removed from shot gun shells,\" according to court documents.It also included \"three canning lids with masking tape, BBs, an improvised fuse, black gun powder, white plastic cup, empty box of box-strike matches, three 16.9 oz.water bottles of gasoline\" and other items.Investigators found that Farnsworth learned to make an incendiary device via online instructions believed to be connected to the Islamic State terror group, according to court records and testimony.Public defender Edward Flint said he was pleased with the sentence in the Martin Farnsworth case, as getting his client released from further incarceration and placed on probation was a primary goal, St.George, Utah, April 24, 2019 | Photo by court pool, St.George NewsEdward Flint, Farnsworth\u2019s attorney, said that building the incendiary device and attempting to use it were a response to bullying his client had received at school and he finally snapped.The result was a criminal act, he added.\"The way life is going, it\u2019s not going well,\" Farnsworth said in a recording of a police interview after he was taken into custody.\"There\u2019s a bunch of bad people.I don\u2019t like the way the world is going.I just wanted to do something to make it different.\"Read more: \u2018If someone got hurt, I probably wouldn\u2019t care\u2019; Teen charged with attempted murder in Pine View High bomb scare\"He feels guilt and remorse, yes, but differently,\" Flint said, referring to Farnsworth being diagnosed with a mild, yet high-functioning form of autism and severe depression.The diagnosis was made by a mental health expert as a part of an evaluation connected to the pre-sentencing report.Read more: Defense in Pine View bombing case says Washington County School District failed teenFlint said the severe depression was a result of the bullying.The perceived lack of empathy on Farnsworth\u2019s part over what he\u2019d done was also a sign of autism spectrum disorder, and not necessary a sign the teen didn\u2019t regret was he had done.\"He\u2019s a model citizen and a good person all around \u2013 but he snapped,\" Flint said.Deputy Washington County Attorney Angela Adams addresses the court in regard to the sentencing of Martin Farnsworth, St.George, Utah, April 24, 2019 | Photo by Court Pool, St.George NewsWestfall did not agree with Flint\u2019s assessment.Being bullied to the point where you hit the bully is snapping, he said.In contrast, Farnsworth\u2019s action were planned out.\"This took some planning.This took some thought, and that\u2019s troubling to me, because you didn\u2019t just \u2018snap.\u2019\"Westfall also addressed Farnsworth prior to sentencing, mentioning that one of the teen\u2019s siblings had written a letter to the court saying the event didn\u2019t define who their brother was.\"Unfortunately, there are things we do that define us,\" Westfall said.\"Had this incendiary device gone off and someone had been hurt, not only would you be defined by this behavior, but so would your family.\"In addition to the 48 months of probation and 250 hours community service, Westfall ordered Farnsworth to wear an ankle monitor for 90 days, have no access to bomb-making materials, seek a psychiatric evaluation for the purpose of getting needed medications, have no internet access for six months, observe a curfew and write an apology letter to Pine View High and its students.Following the sentencing, Deputy Washington County Attorney Angela Adams, who prosecuted the case, said the state was satisfied with the outcome.5th District Judge Michael Westfall listens to the defense for Martin Farnsworth prior to handing down a sentence of 48 months\u2019 probation, St.George, Utah, April 24, 2019 | Photo by Court Pool, St.George News\"He\u2019s getting 48 months of intensely supervised probation,\" Adams said, adding that if Farnsworth does something to put his probation in jeopardy, he could still end up facing the five years-to-life sentence suspended by the judge.\"Of course, we hope he will be successful on probation,\" she said.Adams also said she believes justice was served to the extent that the community is being protected and all involved are doing what they can to minimize the possibility of this incident repeating itself.\"The state is satisfied that the safeguards put into place will protect the community.\"The defense was also pleased with the results of the sentencing.\"What we were hoping for was (Farnsworth) being released from custody into probation without any further juvenile or adult incarceration and that\u2019s what we got,\" Flint said.Farnsworth served 415 days in juvenile detention prior to being released Wednesday.As for the additional restrictions, Flint said they were to be expected and not out of the ordinary for a case involving a first-degree felony.When asked about his client\u2019s reaction, Flint said he didn\u2019t have much of one.\"Martin doesn\u2019t react much,\" he said.\"That\u2019s the nature of autism spectrum disorder.He\u2019s very quiet and introverted.\"Farnsworth\u2019s autism was an angle largely ignored by the state, Flint said, which led to him being treated as a common criminal rather than as someone who needed additional consideration.\"Individuals with autism have a difficult time understanding how other people feel, and have a difficult time processing their own feelings when they are bullied or made fun of or even when they interact normally with other people, they\u2019re going to react differently, and it\u2019s like none of that

{"text": "Manchester Bomber\u2019s Blast Felt on Street Where He Grew UpMANCHESTER, ENGLAND \u2014\u00a0The British-born jihadist behind the worst terror attack in Britain in more than a decade in effect killed and maimed people he\u2019d grown up with \u2014 making the atrocity even more horrifying for Manchester residents still struggling to come to terms with a bombing that killed 22 people and injured 59 others at a concert of American pop star Ariana Grande.As the British government raised the terrorist threat level to \"critical\" \u2014 only the second time authorities have done so \u2014 details began to emerge of the 22-year-old suicide bomber Salman Abedi, his Libyan paternity, and his alleged ties to a well-known recruiter for the Islamic State terror group and other known jihadists.He only recently returned from a three-week trip to Libya, according to family members. British police sources say the trip raises the possibility he may have met with members of the terror group\u2019s affiliate in the North African country to plot the attack and to receive training.Known to police The portrait drawn of the mass killer who packed his improvised explosive device with nails, nuts and bolts to maximize the slaughter, is a mixed one.Some neighbors describe him as a football-obsessed fan of Manchester United and keen enthusiast of computer games.They insist there were no signs the student dropout became radicalized. British security services acknowledged Abedi was known to them \u2014 there are some reports the intelligence service may have tried to persuade him to act as an informant \u2014 but they did not see him as a high risk.Others, though, describe a young man full of rage, who denounced a local mosque leader for his criticism of IS. They say he started to pray openly in the streets.A police officer stands outside Didsbury mosque in Manchester, May 24, 2017.A local imam, Mohammed Saeed, told British newspapers Abedi stopped attending his mosque in 2015 after they argued over IS. \u201cSalman used to come to the mosque occasionally, he wasn\u2019t particularly friendly towards me because he didn\u2019t like my anti-IS sermons. He didn\u2019t like what I was saying and showed me the face of hate. He came to the mosque less and less after that.\u201dSon of Libyan emigresAbedi was born in Manchester in 1994, the third of four children, three boys and one girl. His parents were Libyan emigres who found a home in the northern English city after fleeing the Moammar Gadhafi regime in 1980.His father, Ramadan Abedi, a former security guard at Manchester Airport, returned to Libya in 2011 to join the uprising against the Libyan autocrat. Since Gadhafi\u2019s overthrow his parents spent more time in the North African country than in their home in south Manchester, less than two miles from the scene of Monday\u2019s bombing.Police officers arrive at a residential property on Elsmore Road in Fallowfield, Manchester, on May 24, 2017, as investigations continue into the May 22 terror attack at the Manchester Arena.Libyan emigres in Manchester say the bomber\u2019s father had no time for jihadist ideology. \u201cHe was always very confrontational with jihadi ideology, and this ISIS thing isn\u2019t even jihad, it\u2019s criminality. The family will be devastated,\u201d one told local newspapers.According to the Daily Mirror newspaper, Abedi was a family friend of Raphael Hostey, also known as Abu Qaqa al-Britani, who helped recruit other young Britons for Islamic State via social media until he was killed in a drone strike in Syria last year. British police sources say his ties to Hostey are being probed by counter-terror officials who fear Abedi may have been part of a terror cell, a concern heightened by a trip he made to Libya in the run-up to the bombing.Police also remain skeptical that Abedi could have built the bomb alone because of its sophistication.RadicalizationAbedi attended local schools and then went on to study business and management at nearby Salford University. In a statement, a university spokesman described him as \"completely off the radar. He turned up for lectures for two years and then just stopped coming.\u201dA sign on the front door of a house reads \"Stop Knocking On This Door - We Know Nothing About This Family!!\" is pictured on Elsmore Road in Fallowfield, Manchester, on May 24, 2017.In the last year-and-half both Abedi and his older brother, 23-year-old Ismail, were active on social media sites, praising jihadists. Police arrested Ismail Monday night hours after the blast. He taught Arabic classes at the Didsbury mosque and, according to locals, was reported to police after concerns were raised about what he was teaching.Police are also probing the links between the Abedi brothers and another British-Libyan from Manchester, Abdalraouf Abdallah, who was sentenced to a nine-year-prison term after being convicted of funding terrorism and preparing acts of terrorism.Some analysts argue there were plenty of warning signs about Abedi. In a recent study of young British jihadists for the Henry Jackson Society, a London-based think tank, researcher Emma Webb noted a failure of various agencies and educational institutions to share relevant information about individuals vulnerable to radicalization.She urged police and social services to share \u201crelevant information on vulnerable individuals so the full picture is known across all agencies.\u201d", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Injure maimed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1>

{"text": "Despite President Barack Obama\u2019s recent call to reduce the United States\u2019 reliance on drones, they will likely remain his administration\u2019s weapon of choice. Whereas President George W. Bush oversaw fewer than 50 drone strikes during his tenure, Obama has signed off on over 400 of them in the last four years, making the program the centerpiece of U.S. counterterrorism strategy. The drones have done their job remarkably well: by killing key leaders and denying terrorists sanctuaries in Pakistan, Yemen, and, to a lesser degree, Somalia, drones have devastated al Qaeda and associated anti-American militant groups. And they have done so at little financial cost, at no risk to U.S. forces, and with fewer civilian casualties than many alternative methods would have caused.Critics, however, remain skeptical. They claim that drones kill thousands of innocent civilians, alienate allied governments, anger foreign publics, illegally target Americans, and set a dangerous precedent that irresponsible governments will abuse. Some of these criticisms are valid; others, less so. In the end, drone strikes remain a necessary instrument of counterterrorism. The United States simply cannot tolerate terrorist safe havens in remote parts of Pakistan and elsewhere, and drones offer a comparatively low-risk way of targeting these areas while minimizing collateral damage.So drone warfare is here to stay, and it is likely to expand in the years to come as other countries\u2019 capabilities catch up with those of the United States. But Washington must continue to improve its drone policy, spelling out clearer rules for extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings so that tyrannical regimes will have a harder time pointing to the U.S. drone program to justify attacks against political opponents. At the same time, even as it solidifies the drone program, Washington must remain mindful of the built-in limits of low-cost, unmanned interventions, since the very convenience of drone warfare risks dragging the United States into conflicts it could otherwise avoid.NOBODY DOES IT BETTERThe Obama administration relies on drones for one simple reason: they work. According to data compiled by the New America Foundation, since Obama has been in the White House, U.S. drones have killed an estimated 3,300 al Qaeda, Taliban, and other jihadist operatives in Pakistan and Yemen. That number includes over 50 senior leaders of al Qaeda and the Taliban\u2014top figures who are not easily replaced. In 2010, Osama bin Laden warned his chief aide, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, who was later killed by a drone strike in the Waziristan region of Pakistan in 2011, that when experienced leaders are eliminated, the result is \u201cthe rise of lower leaders who are not as experienced as the former leaders\u201d and who are prone to errors and miscalculations. And drones also hurt terrorist organizations when they eliminate operatives who are lower down on the food chain but who boast special skills: passport forgers, bomb makers, recruiters, and fundraisers.Drones have also undercut terrorists\u2019 ability to communicate and to train new recruits. In order to avoid attracting drones, al Qaeda and Taliban operatives try to avoid using electronic devices or gathering in large numbers. A tip sheet found among jihadists in Mali advised militants to \u201cmaintain complete silence of all wireless contacts\u201d and \u201cavoid gathering in open areas.\u201d Leaders, however, cannot give orders when they are incommunicado, and training on a large scale is nearly impossible when a drone strike could wipe out an entire group of new recruits. Drones have turned al Qaeda\u2019s command and training structures into a liability, forcing the group to choose between having no leaders and risking dead leaders.Critics of drone strikes often fail to take into account the fact that the alternatives are either too risky or unrealistic. To be sure, in an ideal world, militants would be captured alive, allowing authorities to question them and search their compounds for useful information. Raids, arrests, and interrogations can produce vital intelligence and can be less controversial than lethal operations. That is why they should be, and indeed already are, used in stable countries where the United States enjoys the support of the host government. But in war zones or unstable countries, such as Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia, arresting militants is highly dangerous and, even if successful, often inefficient. In those three countries, the government exerts little or no control over remote areas, which means that it is highly dangerous to go after militants hiding out there. Worse yet, in Pakistan and Yemen, the governments have at times cooperated with militants. If the United States regularly sent in special operations forces to hunt down terrorists there, sympathetic officials could easily tip off the jihadists, likely leading to firefights, U.S. casualties, and possibly the deaths of the suspects and innocent civilians.Of course, it was a Navy SEAL team and not a drone strike that finally got bin Laden, but in many cases in which the United States needs to capture or eliminate an enemy, raids are too risky and costly. And even if a raid results in a successful capture, it begets another problem: what to do with the detainee. Prosecuting detainees in a federal or military court is difficult because often the intelligence against terrorists is inadmissible or using it risks jeopardizing sources and methods. And given the fact that the United States is trying to close, rather than expand, the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, it has become much harder to justify holding suspects indefinitely. It has become more politically palatable for the United States to kill rather than detain suspected terrorists.Furthermore, although a drone strike may violate the local state\u2019s sovereignty, it does so to a lesser degree than would putting U.S. boots on the ground or conducting a large-scale air campaign. And compared with a 500-pound bomb dropped from an F-16, the grenadelike warheads carried by most drones create smaller, more precise blast zones that decrease the risk of unexpected structural damage and casualties. Even more important, drones, unlike traditional airplanes, can loiter above a target for hours, waiting for the ideal moment to strike and thus reducing the odds that civilians will be caught in the kill zone.Finally, using drones is also far less bloody than asking allies to hunt down terrorists on the United States\u2019 behalf. The Pakistani and Yemeni militaries, for example, are known to regularly torture and execute detainees, and they often indiscriminately bomb civilian areas or use scorched-earth tactics against militant groups.Some critics of the drone program, such as Ben Emmerson, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, have questioned the lethal approach, arguing for more focus on the factors that might contribute to extremism and terrorism, such as poverty, unemployment, and authoritarianism. Such a strategy is appealing in principle, but it is far from clear how Washington could execute it. Individuals join anti-American terrorist groups for many reasons, ranging from outrage over U.S. support for Israel to anger at their own government\u2019s cooperation with the United States. Some people simply join up because their neighbors are doing so. Slashing unemployment in Yemen, bringing democracy to Saudi Arabia, and building a functioning government in Somalia are laudable goals, but they are not politically or financially possible for the United States, and even if achieved, they still might not reduce the allure of jihad.In some cases, the most sensible alternative to carrying out drone strikes is to do nothing at all. At times, that is the right option: if militants abroad pose little threat or if the risk of killing civilians, delegitimizing allies, or establishing the wrong precedent is too high. But sometimes imminent and intolerable threats do arise and drone strikes are the best way to eliminate them.THE NUMBERS GAMEDespite the obvious benefits of using drones and the problems associated with the alternatives, numerous critics argue that drones still have too many disadvantages. First among them is an unacceptably high level of civilian casualties. Admittedly, drones have killed innocents. But the real debate is over how many and whether alternative approaches are any better. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reports that in 2011, drone strikes killed as many as 146 noncombatants, including as many as 9 children. Columbia Law School\u2019s Human Rights Clinic also cites high numbers of civilian deaths, as does the Pakistani organization Pakistan Body Count. Peter Bergen of the New America Foundation oversees a database of drone casualties culled from U.S. sources and international media reports. He estimates that between 150 and 500 civilians have been killed by drones during Obama\u2019s administration. U.S. officials, meanwhile, maintain that drone strikes have killed almost no civilians. In June 2011, John Brennan, then Obama\u2019s top counterterrorism adviser, even contended that U.S. drone strikes had killed no civilians in the previous year. But these claims are based on the fact that the U.S. government assumes that all military-age males in the blast area of a drone strike are combatants\u2014 unless it can determine after the fact that they were innocent (and such intelligence gathering is not a priority).The United States has recently taken to launching \u201csignature strikes,\u201d which target not specific individuals but instead groups engaged in suspicious activities. This approach makes it even more difficult to distinguish between combatants and civilians and verify body counts of each. Still, as one U.S. official told The New York Times last year, \u201cAl Qaeda is an insular, paranoid organization\u2014innocent neighbors don\u2019t hitchhike rides in the back of trucks headed for the border with guns and bombs.\u201d Of course, not everyone accepts this reasoning. Zeeshan-ul-hassan Usmani, who runs Pakistan Body Count, says that \u201cneither [the United States] nor Pakistan releases any detailed information about the victims . . . so [although the United States] likes to call everybody Taliban, I call everybody civilians.\u201dThe truth is that all the public numbers are unreliable. Who constitutes a civilian is often unclear; when trying to kill the Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud, for example, the United States also killed his doctor. The doctor was not targeting U.S. or allied forces, but he was aiding a known terrorist leader. In addition, most strikes are carried out in such remote locations that it is nearly impossible for independent sources to verify who was killed. In Pakistan, for example, the overwhelming majority of drone killings occur in tribal areas that lie outside the government\u2019s control and are prohibitively dangerous for Westerners and independent local journalists to enter. Thus, although the New America Foundation has come under fire for relying heavily on unverifiable information provided by anonymous U.S. officials, reports from local Pakistani organizations, and the Western organizations that rely on them, are no better: their numbers are frequently doctored by the Pakistani government or by militant groups. After a strike in Pakistan, militants often cordon off the area, remove their dead, and admit only local reporters sympathetic to their cause or decide on a body count themselves. The U.S. media often then draw on such faulty reporting to give the illusion of having used multiple sources. As a result, statistics on civilians killed by drones are often inflated. One of the few truly independent on-the-ground reporting efforts, conducted by the Associated Press last year, concluded that the strikes \u201care killing far fewer civilians than many in [Pakistan] are led to believe.\u201dBut even the most unfavorable estimates of drone casualties reveal that the ratio of civilian to militant deaths\u2014about one to three, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism\u2014is lower than it would be for other forms of strikes. Bombings by F-16s or Tomahawk cruise missile salvos, for example, pack a much more deadly payload. In December 2009, the United States fired Tomahawks at a suspected terrorist training camp in Yemen, and over 30 people were killed in the blast, most of them women and children. At the time, the Yemeni regime refused to allow the use of drones, but had this not been the case, a drone\u2019s real-time surveillance would probably have spotted the large number of women and children, and the attack would have been aborted. Even if the strike had gone forward for some reason, the drone\u2019s far smaller warhead would have killed fewer innocents. Civilian deaths are tragic and pose political problems. But the data show that drones are more discriminate than other types of force.FOREIGN FRIENDSIt is also telling that drones have earned the backing, albeit secret, of foreign governments. In order to maintain popular support, politicians in Pakistan and Yemen routinely rail against the U.S. drone campaign. In reality, however, the governments of both countries have supported it. During the Bush and Obama administrations, Pakistan has even periodically hosted U.S. drone facilities and has been told about strikes in advance. Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan until 2008, was not worried about the drone program\u2019s negative publicity: \u201cIn Pakistan, things fall out of the sky all the time,\u201d he reportedly remarked. Yemen\u2019s former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, also at times allowed drone strikes in his country and even covered for them by telling the public that they were conducted by the Yemeni air force. When the United States\u2019 involvement was leaked in 2002, however, relations between the two countries soured. Still, Saleh later let the drone program resume in Yemen, and his replacement, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has publicly praised drones, saying that \u201cthey pinpoint the target and have zero margin of error, if you know what target you\u2019re aiming at.\u201dAs officials in both Pakistan and Yemen realize, U.S. drone strikes help their governments by targeting common enemies. A memo released by the antisecrecy website WikiLeaks revealed that Pakistan\u2019s army chief, Ashfaq Parvez kayani, privately asked U.S. military leaders in 2008 for \u201ccontinuous Predator coverage\u201d over antigovernment militants, and the journalist Mark Mazzetti has reported that the United States has conducted \u201cgoodwill kills\u201d against Pakistani militants who threatened Pakistan far more than the United States. Thus, in private, Pakistan supports the drone program. As then Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani told Anne Patterson, then the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, in 2008, \u201cWe\u2019ll protest [against the drone program] in the National Assembly and then ignore it.\u201dStill, Pakistan is reluctant to make its approval public. First of all, the country\u2019s inability to fight terrorists on its own soil is a humiliation for Pakistan\u2019s politically powerful armed forces and intelligence service. In addition, although drones kill some of the government\u2019s enemies, they have also targeted pro-government groups that are hostile to the United States, such as the Haqqani network and the Taliban, which Pakistan has supported since its birth in the early 1990s. Even more important, the Pakistani public is vehemently opposed to U.S. drone strikes.A 2012 poll found that 74 percent of Pakistanis viewed the United States as their enemy, likely in part because of the ongoing drone campaign. Similarly, in Yemen, as the scholar Gregory Johnsen has pointed out, drone strikes can win the enmity of entire tribes. This has led critics to argue that the drone program is shortsighted: that it kills today\u2019s enemies but creates tomorrow\u2019s in the process.Such concerns are valid, but the level of local anger over drones is often lower than commonly portrayed. Many surveys of public opinion related to drones are conducted by anti-drone organizations, which results in biased samples. Other surveys exclude those who are unaware of the drone program and thus overstate the importance of those who are angered by it. In addition, many Pakistanis do not realize that the drones often target the very militants who are wreaking havoc on their country. And for most Pakistanis and Yemenis, the most important problems they struggle with are corruption, weak representative institutions, and poor economic growth; the drone program is only a small part of their overall anger, most of which is directed toward their own governments. A poll conducted in 2007, well before the drone campaign had expanded to its current scope, found that only 15 percent of Pakistanis had a favorable opinion of the United States. It is hard to imagine that alternatives to drone strikes, such as seal team raids or cruise missile strikes, would make the United States more popular.THE HOME FRONTStill, public opposition is real, and there is growing concern about the drone strikes even in the United States. The program came under especially heavy criticism domestically in 2011, when Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen born in New Mexico, was killed by a drone strike in Yemen. There is no question that Awlaki was dangerous. Adept at interspersing Islamist rhetoric with pop-culture references, Awlaki had been described as a \u201cpied piper for Western ears\u201d: one admirer was Nidal Malik Hasan, the U.S. Army officer who killed 13 U.S. soldiers at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009.The Obama administration claims that Awlaki was actively involved in plots against the United States and that the strike against him was legal under the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF), which Congress passed three days after 9/11 and which gives the president broad authority to use force against terrorist groups linked to the 9/11 attacks. Yet with the war on terrorism almost 12 years old and bin Laden dead, critics, such as the Georgetown University law professor Rosa Brooks, have begun questioning whether the AUMF still justifies drone strikes today. As Brooks has argued, \u201cMany of the groups now being identified as threats don\u2019t fall clearly under the AUMF\u2019s umbrella\u2014and many don\u2019t pose a significant danger to the United States.\u201d As for the case of Awlaki, opponents of his killing have argued that he did not pose an imminent threat to the United States and that in keeping the evidence used to justify his assassination secret, the administration violated the constitutional guarantee of due process for U.S. citizens. As Ron Paul, then a Texas representative, pointed out during his presidential campaign, Awlaki was never charged with any crime. He added, \u201cIf the American people accept this blindly and casually, that we now have an accepted practice of the president assassinating people who he thinks are bad guys, I think it\u2019s sad.\u201dThe administration contends that the discussions held within the executive branch and the extensive vetting of evidence constitute a form of due process. Meanwhile, as the legal scholar Benjamin Wittes has pointed out, both Congress and the federal courts have repeatedly reaffirmed the validity of the AUMF since 2001. The U.S. government argues that given how secretly terrorists operate, it is not always possible to use other means to stop an individual overseas from planning attacks on U.S. forces or allies. As a result, the imminence of a threat should be assessed based on the individual\u2019s propensity for violence and the likelihood of being able to stop him in the future. Wittes compares the decision-making process to that used in hostage situations, when police are not required to ask a judge for authority to kill a hostage taker or refrain from taking a clear shot if they have one. Perhaps most important, the White House has claimed only a very limited right to conduct drone strikes against U.S. citizens. The administration has asserted the authority to kill only senior al Qaeda leaders who cannot be captured, not any American member of al Qaeda. Indeed, it appears that Awlaki is the only U.S. citizen who has been deliberately killed by a drone.?FOLLOW THE LEADERThe fact remains that by using drones so much, Washington risks setting a troublesome precedent with regard to extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings. Zeke Johnson of Amnesty International contends that \u201cwhen the U.S. government violates international law, that sets a precedent and provides an excuse for the rest of the world to do the same.\u201d And it is alarming to think what leaders such as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has used deadly force against peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators he has deemed terrorists, would do with drones of their own. Similarly, Iran could mockingly cite the U.S. precedent to justify sending drones after rebels in Syria. Even Brennan has conceded that the administration is \u201cestablishing precedents that other nations may follow.\u201dControlling the spread of drone technology will prove impossible; that horse left the barn years ago. Drones are highly capable weapons that are easy to produce, and so there is no chance that Washington can stop other militaries from acquiring and using them. Nearly 90 other countries already have surveillance drones in their arsenals, and China is producing several inexpensive models for export. Armed drones are more difficult to produce and deploy, but they, too, will likely spread rapidly. Beijing even recently announced (although later denied) that it had considered sending a drone to Myanmar (also called Burma) to kill a wanted drug trafficker hiding there.The spread of drones cannot be stopped, but the United States can still influence how they are used. The coming proliferation means that Washington needs to set forth a clear policy now on extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings of terrorists\u2014and stick to it. Fortunately, Obama has begun to discuss what constitutes a legitimate drone strike. But the definition remains murky, and this murkiness will undermine the president\u2019s ability to denounce other countries\u2019 behavior should they start using drones or other means to hunt down enemies. By keeping its policy secret, Washington also makes it easier for critics to claim that the United States is wantonly slaughtering innocents. More transparency would make it harder for countries such as Pakistan to make outlandish claims about what the United States is doing. Drones actually protect many Pakistanis, and Washington should emphasize this fact. By being more open, the administration could also show that it carefully considers the law and the risks to civilians before ordering a strike.Washington needs to be especially open about its use of signature strikes. According to the Obama administration, signature strikes have eliminated not only low-level al Qaeda and Taliban figures but also a surprising number of higher-level officials whose presence at the scenes of the strikes was unexpected. Signature strikes are in keeping with traditional military practice; for the most part, U.S. soldiers have been trained to strike enemies at large, such as German soldiers or Vietcong guerrillas, and not specific individuals. The rise of unconventional warfare, however, has made this usual strategy more difficult because the battlefield is no longer clearly defined and enemies no longer wear identifiable uniforms, making combatants harder to distinguish from civilians. In the case of drones, where there is little on-the-ground knowledge of who is who, signature strikes raise legitimate concerns, especially because the Obama administration has not made clear what its rules and procedures for such strikes are.Washington should exercise particular care with regard to signature strikes because mistakes risk tarnishing the entire drone program. In the absence of other information, the argument that drones are wantonly killing innocents is gaining traction in the United States and abroad. More transparency could help calm these fears that Washington is acting recklessly.The U.S. government also needs to guard against another kind of danger: that the relative ease of using drones will make U.S. intervention abroad too common. The scholars Daniel Brunstetter and Megan Braun have argued that drones provide \u201ca way to avoid deploying troops or conducting an intensive bombing campaign\u201d and that this \u201cmay encourage countries to act on just cause with an ease that is potentially worrisome.\u201d Although al Qaeda remains a threat, it has been substantially defanged since 9/11, thanks to the destruction of its haven in Afghanistan and effective global police, intelligence, and drone campaigns against its cells. In addition, the U.S. government needs to remember that many of the world\u2019s jihadist organizations are focused first and foremost on local regimes and that although the United States has an interest in helping its allies fight extremists, Washington cannot and should not directly involve itself in every fight. The Obama administration should spell out those cases in which the AUMF does not apply and recognize the risks of carrying out so-called goodwill kills on behalf of foreign governments. Helping French and Malian forces defeat jihadists in Mali by providing logistical support, for example, is smart policy, but sending U.S. drones there is not.In places where terrorists are actively plotting against the United States, however, drones give Washington the ability to limit its military commitments abroad while keeping Americans safe. Afghanistan, for example, could again become a Taliban-run haven for terrorists after U.S. forces depart next year. Drones can greatly reduce the risk of this happening. Hovering in the skies above, they can keep Taliban leaders on the run and hinder al Qaeda\u2019s ability to plot another 9/11.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim operatives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer U.S <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Yemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Place Pakistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim Atiyah Abd al-Rahman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim innocents <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim children <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strikes <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Killer United States <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim doctor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Victim Baitullah Mehsud <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Yemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack fired <extra_id_0> Instrument Tomahawks <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker United States <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Killer officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Texas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Place Yemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim Anwar al-Awlaki <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TeachingTrainingLearning train <extra_id_0> Learner recruits <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "New York Gov.Andrew Cuomo (D) said Sunday that there is \u201cno evidence of an international terrorism connection\u201d in the explosion in Chelsea, though he stopped short of saying whoever caused the incident did not want to incite terror.AD\u201cIt depends on your definition of terrorism,\u201d Cuomo said.\u201cA bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism, but it\u2019s not linked to international terrorism.In other words, we find no ISIS connections.\u201dADHe said later: \u201cThis is the nightmare scenario.\u201dNot long after the blast, police said they had found another possible explosive device just blocks away.This device appeared to be similar to a pressure cooker and had wiring on it, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation.Pressure cookers were used in the two bombs detonated at the Boston Marathon in 2013.The bomb squad safely removed the second device, New York police tweeted early Sunday.Police officers, firefighters and other first responders had rushed to the scene of the blast, which closed a major roadway and forced people out of nearby buildings.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said Sunday that the explosion was \u201cintentional,\u201d but noted that few details were available because the investigation was in its early stages.\u201cWe know there was a bombing,\u201d de Blasio said.\u201cWe know it was a very serious incident, but we have a lot more work to do to be able to say what kind of motivation was behind this.\u201dADADHe also echoed his comments from Saturday night that there was no specific, credible threat against New York from any terrorist group.The FBI and NYPD are trying to understand what motivation lay behind the blast.\u201cWe will look at individuals.We will look at associations.We will look at social media,\u201d William Sweeney, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI New York Field Office, said.\u201cUntil we have that information it is not fair for us to give a conclusion [as to motivation],\u201d DeBlasio said.\u201cLet the law enforcement experts draw the conclusions.\u201dPolice Commissioner James O\u2019Neill, whose first day in the position was Saturday, told reporters on Sunday that police were still gathering evidence.AD\u201cWe did find some components indicative of an IED\u2026 that went off intentionally,\u201d O\u2019Neill said.Late Saturday, police had ruled out natural gas as a possible cause of the blast.ADThe New York Police Department\u2019s counterterrorism bureau responded to the explosion, along with officials with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.While O\u2019Neill said authorities were still trying to determine what, precisely, exploded, the NYPD counterterrorism bureau posted a photo online earlier Saturday showing what appeared to be a dumpster or garbage container mangled by a blast:Police in New York also reported shortly after 11 p.m. that they had found the \u201cpossible secondary device\u201d a few blocks away from the Chelsea explosion scene, on 27th Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues.Police directed people away from that intersection, and one officer could be heard telling pedestrians that \u201cthere is a possible explosive\u201d in the area.ADNot long after midnight, police said in a statement that they were asking people in the area of this potential explosive to move away from their windows \u201cuntil we clear the suspicious package,\u201d although officers did not fully evacuate the area.ADAccording to the Associated Press, the second device was removed with a robot and taken to the department firing range in the Bronx.O\u2019Neill said Sunday that two \u201cvery dedicated\u201d former New York state troopers had responded to the initial report of the blast last night.In a search for other explosives, they had parked their vehicle on 27th Street.Walking down the block, they found the second, unexploded device, O\u2019Neill said.ADReports of another suspicious package at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue turned out to be a false alarm \u2014 the package was only garbage, J. Peter Donald, a police spokesman, posted on Twitter around 12:30 a.m. Sunday.The Chelsea explosion occurred about 11 hours after a pipe bomb exploded in a Jersey Shore garbage can, shortly before a scheduled charity 5K race there benefiting Marines and Navy sailors.ADAuthorities have said they have not yet found anything connecting the Chelsea and New Jersey incidents but are continuing to investigate.On Sunday, Cuomo said the \u201cbombs\u201d in Chelsea \u201cappear to be different\u201d from those discovered earlier in the day in New Jersey, though the devices from both states were being shipped to the FBI lab in Quantico for further assessment.He said the devices in New Jersey were \u201cpipe bombs,\u201d and those in Chelsea were not.Cuomo said agents in New York were in touch with those in New Jersey.ADCuomo said officials \u201chave no reason to believe at this time that there is any further immediate threat,\u201d though the National Guard and the New York State Police were deploying an additional 1,000 personnel to bus terminals, airports and subways \u201cjust to err on the side of caution.\u201dADCuomo said the blast in Chelsea \u201ccaused significant property damage,\u201d though he a nearby subway station was structurally safe.He said law enforcement would work diligently to identify and locate those responsible.\u201cWhoever placed these bombs, we will find, and they will be brought to justice,\u201d Cuomo said.The explosion in the area of 23rd Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues occurred about 8:30 p.m. police said.Several of those injured were brought to area hospitals, Donald, the police spokesman, posted on Twitter.ADAll victims were treated and released by Sunday morning, Cuomo said.A spokeswoman for Lenox Health Greenwich Village, which treated nine of the victims, said patients were treated for minor injuries that included lacerations to the head and body.Other hospitals declined to provide specifics about the extent of patients\u2019 injuries from the explosion.ADPhotos and accounts posted on social media Saturday night showed large crowds \u2014 as well as a large law enforcement presence \u2014 in the area near where the explosion occurred.Soleil Filomena, 64, was leaving a convenience store at Seventh Avenue and 23rd Street when she heard the explosion.\u201cIt was so loud it just went through my whole body,\u201d she said.\u201cPeople started running up 23rd Street, and I started running with them.\u201dADFilomena said she saw a \u201cbig black cloud in the sky.\u201d After the explosion, she said her \u201cear was ringing for 15 minutes.\u201dWhen Keith Salomon of Delaware felt the explosion, he was having dinner a block and a half from the site of the blast.His chair and table shook, he said, and he saw people being taken away in ambulances.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know what it was and so, at first, we just kept eating,\u201d said Salomon, 52, who was visiting his son in the city.\u201cBut then we realized something was wrong.\u201dOthers did not hear the explosion but saw the aftermath.When Jacob Schulman left his apartment a few blocks away shortly before 9 p.m., he saw people running and screaming.AD\u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going on, but everyone looked so panicked.I started running.too,\u201d said Schulman, 26, who has lived in the neighborhood since 2014.Two blocks from the blast scene, a group of people emerged from a screening of the animated movie \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d and saw the flashing lights.One man who came out of the theater said he could not hear anything and had no idea about the explosion not far from where he was sitting.President Obama was briefed on the situation in New York and will be updated as more information becomes available, a White House official said late Saturday.Speaking in Colorado not long after the explosion, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump quickly commented on the situation before much information was known.\u201cI must tell you that just before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Trump shortly after getting off of his plane.His comments were made before authorities confirmed the nature of the explosion.Late Saturday, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said it was important to \u201cknow the facts\u201d before drawing conclusions about such incidents.Early Sunday, posts on social media from people in New York showed the area of the explosion to be relatively calm and quiet.Authorities had closed large swaths of roads in the area Saturday night.On Sunday, several roads had reopened but there remained a large police presence in the area.The explosion in New York comes as foreign leaders, including many heads of state, are heading to Manhattan for the United Nations General Assembly.Secretary of State John F. Kerry arrived Saturday, while Obama is scheduled to head to the city on Monday.This annual meeting \u2014 held more than two miles from the site of the explosion in Chelsea \u2014 is traditionally a challenging time for New York, as many roads are shut down and the heavy security leads to traffic jams.The FBI still has no determination as to motive, said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.Agents are examining the detonated material from the first device as well as studying the second, which appeared to resemble a pressure cooker.They are also looking at video from security cameras, social media \u2014 \u201call the logical leads,\u201d the official said.The explosion in Chelsea coincided with a separate attack that took place in Minnesota Saturday night, in which a man stabbed eight people in a St.Cloud mall before he was killed by an off-duty police officer.On Sunday, an ISIS-linked news agency claimed the mall attacker was \u201ca soldier of the Islamic State.\u201dAn FBI spokesman said in an emailed statement that the agency had not determined whether the stabbings were related to the bombing in Manhattan the same night.Speaking to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday morning, New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie (R) said there were no known links so far between the incident in New Jersey and those in New York and Minnesota.Authorities urged any witnesses with tips, video or other credible information about the explosion to call 1-800-577-TIPS.Berman and Wang reported from Washington.Renae Merle in New York

{"text": "Had his homemade bomb gone off\u2014one he had diabolically constructed using shrapnel coated with a substance meant to keep blood from clotting in wounds\u2014Kevin Harpham would have undoubtedly caused the death and injury of many people at last year\u2019s Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Unity March in Spokane, Washington.Instead, Harpham was eventually caught and recently sentenced to 32 years in prison for a hate crime and other offenses related to the attempted bombing. The case illustrates how a quick response by citizens and local law enforcement averted a tragedy and how teamwork and time-tested investigative techniques led to the apprehension of an individual who has shown no remorse for his actions.\u201cClearly he intended to detonate the device, cause mass carnage, and then survey the devastation,\u201d said Special Agent Frank Harrill, who supervised the investigation. \u201cHarpham was acting out against what he termed multiculturalism, but his hatred was firmly rooted in violent white supremacy. This was a prototypical hate crime.\u201dOn January 17, 2011, as hundreds of people gathered in downtown Spokane to participate in the march, Harpham placed his backpack bomb along the parade route at Washington Street and Main Avenue. Alert city workers discovered the suspicious backpack before the march started, and Spokane Police Department officials changed the route as a precaution. The Spokane Police and Sheriff\u2019s Office bomb squad was called in, and their precision in disarming the device enabled evidence to be preserved that would help lead FBI agents to Harpham.The FBI\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) in Spokane immediately began an investigation, and JTTF members canvassed the region for batteries and other components similar to those used in the bomb. Within a month, in a small town about 60 miles north of Spokane, they discovered that a local outlet of a large retail chain was selling the same kind of fishing weights Harpham had used as shrapnel.Store records showed there had been three large purchases of the weights in recent months\u2014two were paid for in cash, but a debit card was used in one transaction, and it belonged to Harpham. At the same time, the FBI Laboratory had been working to extract a DNA sample from the backpack that was later matched to Harpham through his military records.Investigators also learned of Harpham\u2019s white supremacy postings on the Internet and his affiliation with a neo-Nazi group called the National Alliance.Because he lived in a remote, relatively inaccessible area and was likely heavily armed, our Hostage Rescue Team devised a ruse to lure Harpham out of his house. He was arrested March 9, 2011 without incident\u2014but as agents suspected, he was armed when taken into custody.\u201cKevin Harpham was the lone wolf that all of us in law enforcement dread,\u201d Harrill said. \u201cHe lived alone, he worked alone, and he didn\u2019t foreshadow the bombing plot in any meaningful way. He targeted those who were attempting to celebrate an event meant to unite society,\u201d Harrill added, \u201cand he was prepared to indiscriminately kill men, women, and children.\u201dHarrill credited teamwork and strong partnerships for stopping Harpham and bringing him to justice. \u201cFrom the workers who noticed the device to the police response, the JTTF investigation, the expertise of the FBI Laboratory, and the prosecuting skill of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office\u2014everything worked just as it should have.\u201dResources:- Washington Man Sentenced to 32 Years (12/20/2011)- Attempted Bomber Pleads Guilty (09/07/2011)- Attempted Bomber Arrested (03/09/2011)", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentenced <extra_id_0> Defendant Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime offenses  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain caught <extra_id_0> Detainee Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain Arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Bomber <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence Sentenced <extra_id_0> Defendant Man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle disarming <extra_id_0> Artifact device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Disabler squad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Harrill <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Kevin Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonate <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Frank Harrill <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator Joint Terrorism Task Force <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Victim children <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact added <extra_id_0> Participant Harrill <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ImpedeInterfereWith stopping  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict Pleads Guilty <extra_id_0> Defendant Bomber <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack gone off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice his homemade bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble constructed <extra_id_0> Artifact one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components substance <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die death <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injury <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate march <extra_id_0> Demonstrator people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell purchases <extra_id_0> PaymentBarter debit card <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact postings <extra_id_0> Participant Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic white supremacy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection discovered <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity backpack <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Observer workers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate march  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Analysis backs claim drones were used to attack Venezuela\u2019s presidentAnalysis of open source information carried out by the investigative website Bellingcat suggests drones that had been repurposed as flying bombs were indeed used in an attack on the president of Venezuela this weekend.The Venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro using two drones loaded with explosives.The president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred.Initial video from a state-owned television network showed the reaction of Maduro, those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera.But the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions.AP also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim \u2014 suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat.Since then more footage has emerged, including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building.Bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack, including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro\u2019s speech, and using frame-by-frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up.The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s, each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and, when detonated, capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters.DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model, normally used for industrial work \u2014 with a U.S. price tag of around $5,000 apiece, suggesting the attack could have cost little over $10k to carry out \u2014 with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially (for demolition purposes) at a cost of around $30.Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government\u2019s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600, noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors.It also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model, although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed.Venezuela\u2019s interior minister, Nestor Reverol, also claimed the government thwarted the attack using \"special techniques and [radio] signal inhibitors\", which \"disoriented\" the drone that detonated closest to the presidential stand \u2014 a capability Bellingcat notes the Venezuelan security services are reported to have.The second drone was said by Reverol to have \"lost control\" and crashed into a nearby building.Bellingcat says it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion.It adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed.\"It is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated, creating the hole in the wall of this apartment, igniting a fire, and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in Video 2 [of the state TV broadcast of Maduro\u2019s speech],\" it further suggests.Here\u2019s its conclusion:From the open sources of information available, it appears that an attack took place using two DBIEDs while Maduro was giving a speech.Both the drones appear visually similar to DJI Matrice 600s, with at least one displaying features that are consistent with this model.These drones appear to have been loaded with explosive and flown towards the parade.The first drone detonated somewhere above or near the parade, the most likely cause of the casualties announced by the Venezuelan government and pictured on social media.The second drone crashed and exploded approximately 14 seconds later and 400 meters away from the stage, and is the most likely cause of the fire which the Venezuelan firefighters described.It also considers the claim of attribution by a group on social media, calling itself \"Soldados de Franelas\" (aka \u2018T-Shirt Soldiers\u2019 \u2014 a reference to a technique used by protestors wrapping a t-shirt around their head to cover their face and protect their identity), suggesting it\u2019s not clear from the group\u2019s Twitter messages that they are \"unequivocally claiming responsibility for the event\", owing to use of passive language, and to a claim that the drones were shot down by government snipers \u2014 which it says \"does not appear to be supported by the open source information available\".", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument drones

{"text": "By MARI YAMAGUCHI, Associated PressTOKYO (AP) \u2014 Japanese police have arrested a man who admitted to landing a drone with low-level radioactive sand on the roof of the prime minister's office to protest the government's nuclear energy policy, officials said Saturday.Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto, 40, turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan.The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices, the prime ministers' office has said. The infiltration at Japan's political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there.No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident.Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister's office. He has not been indicted and faces further questioning.Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government's nuclear energy policy.Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan's 48 reactors, which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami-triggered Fukushima plant disaster. Abe's administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible.The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium, levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment.The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima, where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai-ichi meltdowns, NHK said.The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities. Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial, service and entertainment use. At a meeting Friday, task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones.It is not clear exactly when the drone landed because workers at the office in central Tokyo rarely go up to the roof. An official taking new employees on a building tour reportedly spotted the drone.A blog with an anti-nuclear theme managed under the name \"Kantei (prime minister's office) Santa\" contained photos of a drone that looked like the one found Wednesday. In one entry, the anonymous writer said he drove from his hometown in Obama city in Fukui to Tokyo and flew the drone in the early hours of April 9, trying to have it land in the yard of the prime minister's office, but that he eventually lost track of the device.In the United States in January, a drone flown by an off-duty intelligence employee crashed on the White House grounds.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Jailer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize found <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Crash crashed  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak disaster  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Yamamoto <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer Police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime obstructing duties  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Instrument unmanned aerial devices <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "On 27 August 1975 a Provisional IRA bomb exploded without warning at the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey, England. There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured, some severely. Two off-duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing.==Background==In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven \"incident centres\" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit (ASU) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang (due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974.==The bombing==The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9:20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off-duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign (Phase Two) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people.==Aftermath==One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a \"carbon copy\" of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences. The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street. The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which, along with the bombings, caused the deaths of nearly 20 people, injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property.==See also==*Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1970\u201379)== References ==", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Caterham Arms public house <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caterham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Instrument bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place England <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> Attacker IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Oxford Street <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Injurer people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle blew <extra_id_0> Artifact roof <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place pub <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer unit <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim hundreds <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injurer unit <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle damage <extra_id_0> Artifact property <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Damager unit <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure lost <extra_id_0> Victim soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassination <extra_id_0> Target Edward Heath <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Their <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack threw <extra_id_0> Attacker attackers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice a bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place bedroom <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Victim Some <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure losing <extra_id_0> Victim soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble planted <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler Balcombe Street Gang <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place house <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection monitor <extra_id_0> Observer centres <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble placed <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Research charge <extra_id_0> Researcher officers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentences <extra_id_0> Defendant people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain caught <extra_id_0> Detainee they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Balcombe Street <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact agreed <extra_id_0> Participant Northern Ireland Office <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

The republic is also famed for its ethnic and linguistic diversity, being home to more than 30 languages.Several dozen Muslim peoples have settled among the high valleys over the centuries.image copyright AFP image caption Villages cling to steep hillsides in Dagestan's spectacular mountainous interiorThe Avars form the largest ethnic group and account for about a fifth of the population. A further substantial proportion is made up of Dargins, Kumyks and Lezgins. About 10 per cent are ethnic Russians. There are also Laks, Tabasarans and Nogai, to name but a few of the other significant groups.The republic's constitution declares the protection of the interests of all of Dagestan's peoples to be a fundamental principle. It is a delicate balance to maintain, in what is Russia's most ethnically diverse province.The republic has oil and gas reserves and also the fisheries potential offered by a share in the resources of the Caspian sea. However, it is prey to organized crime and regional instability. The crime barons may prosper but the people are amongst the poorest in Russia.HistoryDagestan was the birth place of Imam Shamil, the legendary fighter who in the 19th century spearheaded fierce resistance by tribesmen of Chechnya and Dagestan to the spread of the Russian empire. His name is still revered by many in both republics.image copyright AFP image caption Federal troops were deployed to repel incursions by Chechen militants in the 1990sWhen the Bolsheviks sought to enforce control in the Caucasus in the early 1920s, Dagestan became an autonomous Soviet republic within the Russian Federation. During the Stalinist period, its peoples escaped the mass deportation inflicted on their Chechen neighbours and many others.After the fall of the Soviet Union, the republic's authorities stayed loyal to Russia, but the region became infamous for its lawlessness and corruption. Organised crime is reported to flourish and kidnappings and violence are commonplace. Firearms are ubiquitous and assassinations are a regular event.Moscow blames much of this on Chechen-based separatism, but others say lust for profit, combined with a gun culture, is the root cause.Budennovsk and beyondIn the 1990s, separatist warlords from neighbouring Chechen openly led armed operations in Dagestan on several occasions. In 1995 and 1996, they seized hundreds of hostages in hospitals in the Dagestani towns of Budennovsk and Kizlyar. Scores died in the attacks.image copyright AFP image caption Dagestan sees frequent attacks on security forces and assassinationsDagestan's Muslims, who tend to follow sufism combined with local tradition, generally steered clear of Chechen-style separatism, but after the late 1990s, radical and militant elements said to be linked with the more fundamentalist wahhabist tendency began to gain in influence.In August 1999, an Islamic body declared an independent state in parts of Dagestan and Chechnya, and called on Muslims to take up arms against Russia in a holy war.Chechen fighters crossed into Dagestan in support, but within a few weeks, Russian forces had suppressed the insurrection.The republic has seen numerous bombings targeted at the Russian military stationed in the republic.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Contact declares <extra_id_0> Participant republic <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ImpedeInterfereWith resistance <extra_id_0> Impeder tribesmen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ImpedeInterfereWith repel <extra_id_0> Impeder troops <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack Firearms  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassinations  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact blames <extra_id_0> Participant Moscow <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact say <extra_id_0> Participant others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic cause <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain seized <extra_id_0> Detainee hostages <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place towns <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Scores <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target forces <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassinations  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact declared <extra_id_0> Participant body <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand called <extra_id_0> Recipient Muslims <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator body <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation crossed <extra_id_0> Transporter fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination Dagestan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ImpedeInterfereWith suppressed <extra_id_0> Impeder forces <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Target military <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place republic <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation escaped <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact peoples <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

The Cuban government did not respond publicly to that request or made a statement about the issue.Colombia has experienced several years of relative calm since the 2016 peace accord signed by then-President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) fighters.190118182118648With the landmark agreement turning the former rebels into a political party, the smaller ELN is considered the last active rebel group in the country.True to his election promises, Duque has taken a hard line against the ELN.Peace talks with the ELN began in February 2017 under Santos, but Duque has put them on hold until the rebels free all their hostages and stop attacks on military and civilian targets.The group is believed to be currently holding 17 hostages, some of them for several years.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand request <extra_id_0> Communicator Colombia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Cuba <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ImpedeInterfereWith sidesteps <extra_id_0> Impeder Cuba <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Bogota <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker National Liberation Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand urged <extra_id_0> Communicator Ivan Duque <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Cuba <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim attacker <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer ELN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker ELN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target academy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Bogota <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand asked <extra_id_0> Communicator Colombia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Cuba <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain capture <extra_id_0> Detainee Nicolas Rodriguez <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protest <extra_id_0> Demonstrator Colombians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Roadside IED kills Russian major general in SyriaThe desert south and east of Deir ez-Zor on the regime\u2019s side of the Euphrates is rife with insurgentsRussia\u2019s foray into Syria took yet another heavy toll this week, when that nation\u2019s Defense Ministry confirmed that a major general was killed in Syria by an improvised explosive device, Al-Monitor online reported.Major General Vyacheslav Gladkikh died after a roadside IED detonated under a convoy of Russian soldiers and Syrian pro-regime militiamen near the city of Deir ez-Zor.Three other Russian military personnel were wounded, Russia\u2019s state-run Tass news agency reported.A local commander of Syria\u2019s National Defense Forces, a pro-Assad militia, was also reportedly killed.\u201cThey\u2019ve changed their tactics there,\u201d said one source, who declined to be named for security reasons.\u201cThey do nighttime infiltrations, lay mines and booby traps.\u201dVideo purporting to show the explosion circulated on social media this week.It was the first reported death of a Russian general in Syria since 2017, when a lieutenant general was killed in the same province, reportedly by mortar fire from the Islamic State, Al-Monitor reported.Deir ez-Zor and nearly all of Syrian territory west of the Euphrates River lie in Syrian government hands, with the major exception of Idlib province, the last rebel enclave in the country\u2019s nearly decadelong civil war.US-backed and Kurdish-led militias captured IS\u2019 last remaining territory in March 2019, but the desert countryside south and east of Deir ez-Zor on the regime\u2019s side of the Euphrates is rife with insurgents who continue to ambush pro-Syrian regime forces, Al-Monitor reported.Syria\u2019s eastern Badia, or desert, remains the country\u2019s last significant hot spot of IS activity.In April, more than two dozen Syrian pro-regime fighters were killed in IS attacks in Badia al-Sukhnah and Badia al-Sham, prompting Russian airstrikes, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Killings of local tribal figures recently rocked the east side of the Euphrates in Deir ez-Zor, which is controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, Al-Monitor reported.It is not clear who carried out the slayings, though locals have alternatively blamed IS and the Assad regime.A US official told Al-Monitor last month that there could be anywhere from 2,000 to 10,000 IS insurgents in sleeper cells across Iraq and Syria.Coalition spokesman US Army Col. Myles Caggins III told Al-Monitor that the US recently provided Iraqi authorities with \u201cseveral million dollars\u2019 worth\u201d of border security infrastructure to interdict illicit smuggling in the border area.The Pentagon says US special forces at the isolated al-Tanf base in the Badia are there to keep pressure on IS in the border area, but rebels have told Al-Monitor that the proximity of Russian and Syrian forces on the roads outside the US-controlled zone make operations outside the area difficult.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die kills <extra_id_0> Victim general <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Syria <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim general <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Al-Monitor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Vyacheslav Gladkikh <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim personnel <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim commander <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim general <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place province <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Al-Monitor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer IS <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Al-Monitor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Al-Monitor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker IS <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Badia al-Sham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation smuggling  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact confirmed <extra_id_0> Communicator Defense Ministry <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Tass <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator source <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Defense Admits Suspect's Guilt in Boston Marathon BombingThe defense lawyer for suspected Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told the jury at his trial Wednesday that he helped carry out the deadly 2013 attack, but contended that Tsarnaev's older brother was the mastermind behind the plot.\"It was him,\" attorney Judy Clarke said of her client, who is facing the death penalty if convicted of setting off a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs, packed with nails and ball bearings, at the finish line of the annual race in 2013 that killed three people and injured another 264.Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to the 30 counts against him, including the fatal shooting of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer days after the bombings as the Tsarnaevs tried to flee.Clarke, one of the U.S.'s foremost death penalty legal specialists, told jurors on the first day of the trial the defense will not \"sidestep\" Tsarnaev's guilt.Influence of older brotherBut she claimed that he was deeply influenced by his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, to carry out the attack, which a prosecutor alleged was aimed at avenging U.S. wars in Muslim countries.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev inadvertently killed his brother, running over him with a car, as they attempted to elude police days after authorities had identified them as suspects in the bombings.In this courtroom sketch, defense attorney Judy Clarke is depicted delivering opening statements in front of U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr., on the first day of the federal death penalty trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, March 4, 2015, in Boston.\"It was Tamerlan Tsarnaev who self-radicalized,\" Clarke said. \"It was Dzhokhar who followed him. The evidence will show that Tamerlan planned and orchestrated and enlisted his brother into this series of horrific acts.\"In blaming the older brother, Clarke's strategy appeared aimed at sparing the 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev from the death penalty. If Tsarnaev is convicted, the jury will decide whether he is executed or gets life in prison without the possibility of parole.The approach set up an immediate conflict with U.S. District Judge George O'Toole, who had ruled that the question of the relative culpability of the two brothers was best left to the trial's second phase, once Dzhokhar's guilt has been established.\u201cSome evidence of the brother's interactions will be inevitable,\u201d O'Toole allowed in brief remarks before the trial opened. But he interrupted Clarke multiple times to warn her against going too deep into family history.Defense lawyers had fought up to the last minute to have the trial moved out of Massachusetts, arguing the emotional impact of the bombings ran too deep and too many people had personal connections to the case. Their requests were rejected by O'Toole and a federal appeals court.Prosecutors lay out caseIn his opening statement, U.S. prosecutor William Weinreb accused the younger Tsarnaev of detonating bombs designed to \"tear people apart and create a bloody spectacle.\"Weinreb described the two homemade pressure cooker bombs used in the attack as the type \"favored by terrorists\" because of the mayhem and injuries they could cause. After the blasts, he said, \"The air was filled with the smell of burning sulfur and people's screams.\"Watch video from VOA's Carolyn Presutti:Video sizewidthxheightpixelsDefense Concedes Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Carried Out Boston Marathon BombingsShare this video0:02:20\u25b60:00:00/0:02:20\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 5.6MB360p | 7.7MB720p | 51.3MBThe prosecutor said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev \"believed that he was a soldier in a holy war against Americans.\" Weinreb said Tsarnaev \"also believed that by winning that victory, he had taken a step toward reaching paradise. That was his motive for committing these crimes.\"The shaggy-haired Tsarnaev stared straight ahead, avoiding looking at the jury, as the prosecutor spoke.Victims at trialMore than 20 victims of the blasts watched the early moments of the trial, taking up the entire left-hand side of the courtroom.Two dramatically different portraits of the former college student are expected to emerge during the trial.Was he a submissive, adoring younger brother who only followed directions given by his older, radicalized brother? Or was he a willing, active participant in the attacks?The brothers are ethnic Chechens who had lived in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and the volatile Dagestan region of Russia before coming to the U.S. with their parents and two sisters about a decade before the bombings.Some material for this report came from Reuters and AP.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack Bombing <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize suspected <extra_id_0> IdentifiedRole bomber <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 264 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shooting <extra_id_0> Target officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer brother <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize identified <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject them <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Identifier authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifiedRole suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt jury <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ReleaseParole parole <extra_id_0> Defendant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt jury <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain gets life in prison <extra_id_0> Detainee he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Prosecutor William Weinreb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonating <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Instrument they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime mayhem  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack Bombings <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crimes  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Wealth of Clues Led to Quick Arrest of New York Suspected BomberNEW YORK \u2014\u00a0The man suspected of planting bombs in a New York neighborhood and a New Jersey seaside town may have aimed to inflict carnage incognito, but he didn't succeed for long in concealing his identity.Ahmad Khan Rahami provided investigators with a wealth of clues that led to his arrest about 50 hours after the first explosion, according to three law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation.His fingerprints and DNA were found at the scene of the Manhattan bombing, they said. His uncovered face was clearly captured by surveillance cameras near the spot of the blast.Electronic toll records show a car to which he had access was driven from New Jersey to Manhattan and back to New Jersey the day of the bombing, according to the officials, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss an ongoing case.Those and other clues spurred officials to publicize his name and photo Monday morning, asking for help finding Rahami, 28, a Muslim U.S. citizen born in Afghanistan, who lives with his family in Elizabeth, New Jersey.As the investigation heated up, a bar owner in Linden, New Jersey, reported someone asleep in his doorway. An officer went to investigate and recognized the man as Rahami, police and the mayor said.Rahami pulled a gun and shot the officer \u2014 who was wearing a bulletproof vest \u2014 in the torso, and more officers joined in a running gun battle along the street and brought Rahami down, police Capt. James Sarnicki said. Another police officer was grazed by a bullet.\"A lot of technology involved in this, but a lot of good, old-fashioned police work, too,\" said New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill. He said now, investigators would \"make sure that we get to the bottom of who's involved and why.\"After surgery for a gunshot wound to his leg, Rahami was being held on $5.2 million bail, charged with five counts of attempted murder of police officers. Federal prosecutors said they still were weighing charges over the bombings. Rahami remains hospitalized.Messages left for family members were not immediately returned. It wasn't clear when Rahami would get an attorney.Officials said they have no other suspects at large, but cautioned they are still investigating.The bombing spread fear across the New York area and revived anxiety about homegrown terrorism nationwide.As the East Coast was rattled by the bombings, a man who authorities say referred to Allah wounded nine people in a stabbing rampage at a Minnesota mall Saturday before being shot to death by an off-duty police officer. Authorities are investigating the stabbings as a possible terrorist attack but have not drawn any connection between the bloodshed there and the bombings.William Sweeney Jr., the FBI's assistant director in New York, said there was no indication so far that the bombings were the work of a larger terror cell.Rahami wasn't on any terror or no-fly watch lists, though he had been interviewed for immigration purposes traveling between the U.S. and Afghanistan, one of the law enforcement officials said.Rahami and his family live above their restaurant \u2014 called First American Fried Chicken \u2014 and the family has clashed with the city over closing times and noise complaints, which the Rahamis said in a lawsuit were tinged with anti-Muslim sentiment.The lawsuit was terminated in 2012 because one of Rahami's brothers had pleaded guilty to blocking police from enforcing closing hours at the restaurant.A childhood friend, Flee Jones, said Rahami had become more religious after returning from a trip to Afghanistan several years ago. Still, some of the family restaurant's customers said Rahami was more likely to talk about his interest in cars than to mention faith.\"He's a very friendly guy,\" patron Ryan McCann said. \"That's what's so scary.\"The investigation began when a pipe bomb blew up Saturday morning in Seaside Park, New Jersey, before a charity race to benefit Marines. No one was injured.Then a shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bomb exploded Saturday night in New York's Chelsea section, wounding 29 people, none seriously. An unexploded pressure-cooker bomb was found blocks away.Late Sunday night, five explosive devices were discovered in a trash can at an Elizabeth train station, about 3 miles from where Rahami was later found asleep in the doorway of a bar.Investigators are still gathering evidence and have not publicly tied Rahami to those devices, though Sweeney noted they aren't \"ruling anything out.\"The bombs discovered Saturday all used flip cellphones as a trigger and were all made with easily purchasable materials, a federal law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said.After zeroing in on Rahami and learning of the car that had traveled between New Jersey and New York, authorities pulled it over Sunday night after it headed in the direction of Kennedy airport. The law enforcement officials said at least one of Rahami's relatives was in the car.All five were questioned and released, Sweeney said. He declined to say whether they might later face charges.Around the time Rahami was captured, President Barack Obama was in New York on a previously scheduled visit for a meeting of the U.N.

{"text": "Belgium Police Release New Video of Brussels Bombing SuspectPARIS \u2014\u00a0Belgian police have released new video of a wanted Brussels airport bombing suspect even as the lawyer for a Paris attacks suspect says his extradition may take a few more weeks.Released Thursday in French and Flemish, the police video shows the minutes following the March 22 Zaventem Airport bombings and the apparent getaway of the third surviving suspect -- often identified in the media as \"the man with the hat.\" Local media previously released security camera video of the man at Zaventem Airport shortly before the bombings, wearing a hat and a light jacket and walking alongside suicide bombers Ibrahim el-Bakraoui and Najim Laachraoui. All three men are seen pushing carts with bags on them.With running commentary in French and Flemish, the police footage shows the third man leaving the airport after the bombs went off at 7:58 a.m. First he is walking, then he breaks into a jog. His face is not seen clearly in the new images.Watch video released by FedPol Belgium:We are sorry, but this feature is currently not availableAccording to Belgian authorities, the man walked more then 10 kilometers in the ensuring hours, crossing the town of Zaventem with video finally showing him in the Schaerbeek area of Brussels, before disappearing at a crossroads at 09:50 local time. Police say he got rid of his jacket along the way, and subsequent footage shows him in shirtsleeves. He is described as wearing a light blue shirt, dark pants and brown shoes with wide white soles.Asking for citizens' help Belgian police have released local and international phone numbers for people to call if they have any information on the man or a jacket that looks like the one in the video.The Brussels airport attacks, along with a suicide bombing at the Maelbeek metro station in the Belgian capital about an hour later, killed 32 people and wounded more than 340.This photo provided on Wednesday, March 23, 2016 by Interpol shows Belgium's Khalid Bakraoui. Belgian state broadcaster RTBF has identified two of the attackers who targeted Brussels as brothers Khalid and Brahim Bakraoui.Ibrahim el-Bakraoui\u2019s brother, Khalid, was named as the suicide bomber in the metro attack. Both brothers had criminal records. Turkish authorities had earlier caught Ibrahim el-Bakraoui trying to cross into Syria and deported him.Authorities have found a tangle of links between the Brussels attacks suspects and those involved in the November attacks in Paris \u2014 including surviving Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam, who is believed to have been in charge of logistics. The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for both attacks.Born in France but brought up in Belgium, Abdeslam was arrested days before the Brussels attacks and is currently in a high-security Belgian prison awaiting extradition to France. That move had been expected to be imminent, but his Belgian lawyer, Sven Mary, told journalists Thursday that Abdeslam\u2019s extradition would not happen for several weeks.Lawyer Mary also said Abdeslam was not formally implicated to date in the Brussels attacks.A Belgian police officer secures the area around the European Council headquarters following recent bomb attacks in the Brussels metro and at Belgian international airport of Zaventem, in Brussels, Belgium, March 30, 2016.Criticism of intelligence lapses Belgian authorities have been sharply criticized for intelligence lapses leading up to the attacks.The country\u2019s justice and interior ministers both tendered their resignations, which Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel refused to accept.Last month, Belgian authorities said they had arrested the suspected \"man with the hat,\" who the prosecutors\u2019 office identified as Faycal C., before releasing him days later, apparently for lack of sufficient evidence.Media identified him early on as Faycal Cheffou, a self-styled freelance journalist.

{"text": "British Security Services Questioned About Surveillance PrioritiesLONDON \u2014\u00a0For the second time in a month Britain\u2019s security services are facing awkward questions about their surveillance policies, after it emerged the ringleader of Saturday\u2019s terror attack in the heart of London was known to them and had been interrogated in the past.The British-Pakistani, who police are not naming for operational reasons, was also a recognized Islamic State follower in the streets around his home in the east London district of Barking, where he tried to recruit children and proselytized openly in a nearby park, sparking a complaint to the police by a local resident.The 27-year-old, father of at least two young children, appeared also in a television documentary last year in which he was pictured unfurling an Islamic State banner and later arguing with police during a London protest organized by radical preacher Anjem Choudary, a convicted IS recruiter.Last month, community and mosque leaders in Manchester and neighbors of Salman Abedi, the British-Libyan who carried out the May 22 concert bombing in the city, accused the security services of missing several opportunities to identify him as a high-risk militant.FILE - A police officer stands outside Didsbury mosque in Manchester, Britain, May 24, 2017.At least five times locals warned the police of their fears about the 22-year-old suicide bomber. One community worker said he contacted authorities after Abedi said being a suicide bomber was OK.Insufficient responseNeither Britain\u2019s domestic intelligence service MI5 nor the Manchester police responded to the claims, but lawmakers have demanded to know why Abedi was seen just as a peripheral figure and one not requiring surveillance and investigation.FILE - Salman Abedi, the bomber behind the Manchester suicide bombing, is seen in this image taken from CCTV on the night he committed the attack in this handout photo released, May 27, 2017, from the Greater Manchester Police.Similar questions are being prompted again in the wake of the van-and-knife attack in the London Bridge district of Britain\u2019s capital. Erica Gasparri, a mother of three who lived in Barking told local media she had reported Abedi two years ago, after he approached kids in a local park. She says she confronted him after her two children came home and said, \u201cMummy I want to become a Muslim.\u201dThe parents of the ringleader of Saturday\u2019s attack are reported to have been asylum seekers from Pakistan. According to local media, the man, nicknamed Abz, worked at various times for a fast-food outlet, a clothing store and subsequently for the London Underground system.FILE - Police attend to an incident on London Bridge in London, Britain, June 3, 2017.A onetime friend of the ringleader also told the BBC that he warned police, alerting them to comments made about previous terrorist attacks in Britain and of his alarm at the man's increasingly extremist beliefs. The friend said the alleged attacker was a keen follower of American radical preacher Ahmad Musa Jibril and would watch YouTube videos of the cleric.\u201cHe used to listen to a lot of Musa Jibril,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cI phoned the anti-terror hotline. I spoke to the gentleman. I told him about our conversation and why I think he was radicalized ... I did my bit, I know a lot of other people did their bit, but the authorities did not do their bit,\u201d he added.Security strategy reviewA senior Conservative official told VOA that there is deep frustration in Downing Street about Saturday\u2019s attack and the fact that at least one of the assailants was known to the authorities.Prime Minister Theresa May promised to review Britain\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy, holding out the prospects of enhanced powers for the security services and longer jail sentences for extremists. She said she wants to take a tougher line with internet providers and social media businesses that allow extremist material on their sites.WATCH: British Prime Minister Theresa MayVideo sizewidthxheightpixelsBritain PM May: 'Enough is Enough'Share this video0:00:30\u25b60:00:00/0:00:30\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 1.5MB360p | 1.8MB480p | 10.5MBAmong the measures being recommended by security chiefs, according to government officials, is the power to require those on terror watch lists to wear electronic tags, a ban on the sale of unregistered SIM cards, and a ban on immediate vehicle rentals, requiring renters to wait two hours and for rental firms to run checks on them with the police.Police and counter-terror officers launched further raids early Monday in east London. A police spokesman said \u201ca number\u201d of people had been detained. Local residents reported hearing bangs and gunshots during the raids.

{"text": "Kyrgyzstan National Pleads Not Guilty to Hampering Boston Bomb ProbeBOSTON \u2014\u00a0A citizen of Kyrgyzstan on Wednesday pleaded not guilty to charges of lying to federal investigators about his ties to the two ethnic Chechen men accused of carrying out the Boston Marathon bombing.Khairullozhon Matanov, 23, faces one criminal count of destroying records and three counts of lying to officials in a terrorism investigation. He is not charged with taking part in the April 15, 2013, attack, which killed three people and injured more than 260.Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler ordered Matanov held until trial, after his attorney noted that it was unclear how the man would support himself after losing his job as a taxi driver following his arrest.She left open the option for his lawyer to seek his pretrial release if he were to find living arrangements.Matanov's involvementAn FBI agent who had worked on his case acknowledged under cross-examination by defense attorney Edward Hayden that Matanov, who lived in Quincy, Massachusetts, had shown up at a local police station the morning of April 19, 2013, while a manhunt was under way for suspected bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, to identify the man, but that the FBI had not interviewed him until the next day.Hayden noted that charging papers pointed out that Matanov had dinner with the suspected bombers, Dzhokhar and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the night of the attack and discussed the incident. Hayden asked FBI Special Agent Timothy McElroy undercross-examination if there was any evidence that Matanov at the time had suspected the Tsarnaevs of being involved in the attack.\"There's nothing in here, no,\" said McElroy, consulting court papers.Pending chargesProsecutors said Matanov deleted searches related to the attacks from his computer and tried to dispose of cell phones he described as illegal after the FBI released photos of the suspected bombers on April 18, 2013.Matanov was brought into court on Wednesday handcuffed and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit. His attorney said he entered the United States in 2010 on a student visa and was later granted political asylum due to ethnic clashes in his native Kyrgyzstan.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, is being held in a federal prison west of Boston awaiting trial on charges that carry the threat of execution if he is convicted.

{"text": "The Cafeter\u00eda Rolando bombing was an attack on 13 September 1974 at the Rolando cafe in Calle del Correo, Madrid, Spain which killed 13 people and wounded 71. Though no claim of responsibility was made, the attack is widely believed to have been carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA.==Background==The Rolando Cafe was located on 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid, close to the General Directorate of Security, the headquarters of the Spanish Police. It was regularly frequented by members of the police force and security services.==The attack==The bomb was placed at the entrance to the building and exploded on a Friday afternoon, during a busy lunchtime period. More than 300 people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the explosion, two of whom were among the dead. The explosion caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security, while two cars parked nearby were totally destroyed. The bomb caused part of the Rolando Cafe's ceiling to collapse and guests staying in a pension above were injured due to falling through the gaps in the ceiling. The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene.Two of the 12 initially killed and 11 of the injured were members of the police force. However the wounded included the number two of the Spanish Political Police, with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe. A thirteenth victim died in 1977 of injuries suffered during the attack.==Responses and arrests==The leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September, issued a statement denying their responsibility, though implicitly defending the bombing, claiming that the cafe was full of police agents. This caused tensions within the group, with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out, even if the results were not those intended. The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country, such as Blas Pi\u00f1ar, the opportunity to attack the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro.In the immediate period of confusion following the attack, some blamed the attack on the far-right. The police, however, concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group's infrastructure in Madrid. Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) of cooperating in the attack, but the PCE energetically denied involvement. Reports that police officers had received a circular advising them not to go to the Rolando Cafe or stand outside the building added to the mystery surrounding the incident.Leftists known to be sympathetic to ETA were arrested, including Eva Forest, wife of the communist playwright Alfonso Sastre, Mari Luz Fernandez and her relatives, Lidia Falc\u00f3n, the theatre director Vicente Sainz de la Pe\u00f1a, construction worker Antonio Dur\u00e1n, pilot Bernardo Badell and his wife Mar\u00eda del Carmen Nadal, the actress Mar\u00eda Paz Ballesteros, and the writer Eliseo Bayo. Between June 1975 and February 1976, courts dismissed the cases and released the defendants. However Eva Forest and Mari Luz Fernandez remained in prison as they were charged with complicity in the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco one year before. However, neither Forest nor Luz Fernandez were tried for the Rolando bombing, as they were released in June 1977 as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners. In 1981 Lidia Falc\u00f3n published a denunciation of Eva Forest which suggested that Forest's role in the Rolando attack had been considerable.The government also offered a reward of one million pesetas for information leading to the capture of Juan Manuel Galarraga Mendizabal who they suspected of being a high ranking ETA figure involved in the bombing. Exact authorship of the bombing has however remained a mystery.==References==", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place Cafeter\u00eda Rolando <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Rolando cafe <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim 71 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> Target building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place El Tobogan restaurant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim whom <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle damage <extra_id_0> Artifact buildings <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle shattering <extra_id_0> Artifact windows <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle destroyed <extra_id_0> Artifact cars <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle collapse <extra_id_0> Artifact ceiling <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim guests <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim 12 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 11 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim customers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim victim <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker organisation <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Eliseo Bayo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target Carlos Arias Navarro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassination <extra_id_0> Target Luis Carrero Blanco <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ReleaseParole released <extra_id_0> Defendant they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack carried out <extra_id_0> Attacker ETA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble placed <extra_id_0> Artifact bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact issued <extra_id_0> Topic statement <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator leadership <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

He said it was not Ebola, meningitis, dengue or chikungunya. He added that the victims were four children and four adults.The symptoms exhibited by the dead were spots on the body that turned to boils, high fever, massive hemorrhaging stemming from smaller hemorrhagic incidents, and multi-organ failure.

{"text": "Questions have been raised in recent days about the political and religious beliefs of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bombing suspect killed in a gunfight with police in the early hours of Friday.Anecdotes suggest that Tamerlan became more religious in the last several years and may have embraced more conservative Islamic ideas, although no link has been established between him and any known terrorist group.On Monday, a spokesman for the Islamic Society of Boston, a Cambridge mosque frequented by Tamerlan, contributed to the emerging debate over the suspect\u2019s religious beliefs by sharing an anecdote from a January talk at the mosque, during which Tamerlan disrupted the event and insulted the speaker, accusing him of deviating from Islam by comparing the Prophet Muhammad to Martin Luther King Jr.It was the second time that Tamerlan disrupted an event at the mosque because he felt that its religious message was too liberal, said the spokesman, Yusufi Vali, according to a report in The Boston Globe.In disrupting the talk in January at the Islamic Society of Boston mosque in Cambridge, Tamerlan Tsarnaev\u2019s shouted at a speaker: \u201cYou are a Kafir\u201d \u2014 a nonbeliever, according to Yusufi Vali, a spokesman for the mosque.Tsarnaev went on to say the speaker was contaminating people\u2019s minds and accused him of being a hypocrite.The congregation disagreed, according to Vali, and \u201cshouted him out of the mosque\u201d on Prospect Street.Tsarnaev also interrupted a talk last November when a speaker said it was fine for people to celebrate holidays such as Thanksgiving and July 4, in the same way you celebrate the birthday of the Prophet.Tsarnaev challenged him and the two talked after service.\u201cThe brother was angry, but he left,\u2019\u2019 Vali said.The Islamic Society of Boston issued a news release on Monday afternoon detailing the organization\u2019s interactions with the suspects, who it said were \u201cneither members nor regular attendees\u201d of religious services there.The statement focused almost exclusively on Tamerlan, who the organization said had begun coming \u201cintermittently\u201d to weekly Friday Prayers and \u201coccasionally\u201d to daily services about a year ago.It said Dzhokhar \u201cwas rarely seen at the center, coming only occasionally for prayer.\u201dThe statement included lengthy descriptions of the incidents in January and November when Tamerlan disrupted events at the mosque, leading the community there to reprimand and ostracize him.On November 16, 2012, at our weekly congregational prayer, one of our preachers sermonized that it was appropriate to celebrate national holidays like July 4th and Thanksgiving, just like the birthday of the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him).The older suspect stood up during the sermon and challenged the preacher, arguing that celebration of any holiday was not allowed in the faith.After the sermon ended and the congregational prayer was finished, the preacher met with the older suspect to share his opinion.The suspect repeatedly argued his viewpoint, and then left.On January 18, 2013, one of our preachers noted that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a great person remembered in history.The older suspect stood up, shouted and called him a \u201cnonbeliever\u201d; said that he was \u201ccontaminating people\u2019s minds\u201d; and began calling him a hypocrite.People of the congregation, in turn, shouted back at the older suspect, \u201cLeave now!\u201d Due to the congregation\u2019s disapproval, he left the sermon.After the sermon and the congregational prayer ended, a few volunteer leaders of the mosque sat down with the older suspect and gave him a clear choice: either he stops interrupting sermons and remains silent or he would not be welcomed.While he continued to attend some of the congregational prayers after the January incident, he neither interrupted another sermon nor did he cause any other disturbances.The statement said that no member of the mosque\u2019s board or staff \u201cever interacted\u201d with either Dzhokhar or Tamerlan, who it said \u201cdisagreed with the moderate American-Islamic theology of the I.S.B.Cambridge mosque.\u201d\u201cOur mosque is one filled with attendees who are teachers, businessmen, doctors and lawyers, all of whom are committed to the public good,\u201d the statement said.\u201cWhile these suspects did express views counter to our mosque\u2019s philosophy, they never expressed any hint of violent sentiments or behavior.If they had, the F.B.I.would have immediately been called.\u201dOn Saturday, the mosque posted a long note on its front door, which was photographed and uploaded to Twitter by several people, including Steve Annear, a freelance journalist and contributor to Boston Magazine.Here is the note about the bombing suspects on the door of the Islamic Society of Boston.They were guest s there.//t.co/vdv1ZWxagi \u2014 Steve Annear (@steveannear) 21 Apr 13The note expressed shock and sadness at the bombing of the Boston Marathon and urged members of the congregation to contact the F.B.I.with any information they may have about the Tsarnaev brothers.The statement was also posted on the mosque\u2019s Web site.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston Marathon <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact contributed <extra_id_0> Participant spokesman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Cambridge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic beliefs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Prophet <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact issued <extra_id_0> Communicator Islamic Society of Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact posted <extra_id_0> Communicator mosque <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Steve Annear <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic note <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The Taliban killed more than 100 members of the Afghan security forces inside a military compound in central Maidan Wardak province on Monday, a senior defense official said.\"We have information that 126 people have been killed in the explosion inside the military training center, eight special commandoes are among the dead,\" said a senior official in the defense ministry in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity.The official said the assault began on Monday morning when the attackers rammed a car full explosives through a military checkpoint and detonated the vehicle inside the campus of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) forces training center in Maidan Shahr, the capital of Maidan Wardak province.Two gunmen entered the campus right after the explosion and shot at many Afghan soldiers before being gunned down during the clashes.Defense ministry officials said the Taliban had used U.S.-made armored Humvee vehicles captured from Afghan forces as a car bomb in order to breach the military fortifications.A second source residing in Maidan Wardak province said more than 100 members of National Directorate of Security (NDS) were killed in the complex attack.\"I have been in touch with the NDS official in the province and they told me that over 100 members of the NDS were killed in the big explosion,\" the former provincial official said.Sharif Hotak, a member of the provincial council in Maidan Wardak said he saw bodies of 35 Afghan forces in the hospital.\"Many more were killed. Several bodies were transported to Kabul city and many injured were transferred to hospitals in Kabul,\" said Hotak, adding that \"the government was hiding the accurate casualty figures to prevent a further dip in the morale of the Afghan forces.\"\"The explosion was very powerful. The whole building has collapsed,\" he said.Government officials in Maidan Wardak and Kabul declined to comment when asked if they were obscuring the death toll.Two senior officials in the interior ministry said the exact casualty figures were not being disclosed to prevent unrest within the armed forces.\"I have been told not to make the death toll figures public. It is frustrating to hide the facts,\" said a senior interior ministry official in Kabul.A senior NDS official in Kabul said at least 50 people were killed or wounded in the complex attack.Abdurrahman Mangal, spokesman for the provincial governor in Maidan Wardak said 12 people were killed and 12 were injured when the car bomb exploded near the Afghan special forces unit.President Ashraf Ghani's office in a statement said the \"enemies of the country\" had carried out an attack against NDS personnel in Maidan Shahr. \"They killed and wounded a number of our beloved and honest sons.\"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan condemned the attack on Monday evening and extended his condolences to Ghani.Meanwhile, the Taliban said it met with U.S. officials in Qatar on Monday, in the latest round of talks between the insurgents and Washington aimed at bringing an end to the 17-year war.The U.S. has not officially commented on the reported meeting, which follows the last confirmed talks between the two parties in the UAE in December.\"Following American acceptance of the agenda of ending the occupation of Afghanistan and preventing Afghanistan from being used against other countries in the future, talks with American representatives took place today in Doha, the capital of Qatar,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.Taliban representatives have met several times with U.S. officials in recent months, but last week threatened to suspend the fledgling process, lambasting Washington for changing the agenda of the talks and \"unilaterally\" adding new subjects.The insurgents have long refused to hold direct talks with the Kabul government -- despite U.S. pleas -- which the Taliban dismisses as a puppet of Washington.In recent years the Afghan government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures. Last year Ghani has said 28,000 Afghan police officers and soldiers have been killed since 2015, breaking the longstanding suppression on casualty data.Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack. Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline terrorist group said they have killed 190 people in the complex attack.Last week, Taliban fighters set off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five people and wounding more than 110 Afghans and expatriates in the capital, Kabul.On Sunday, a suicide bombing in the southeastern province of Logar left eight policemen dead and another 10 wounded.The Taliban bombing targeted the provincial governor's convoy in Mohammad Agha district. The provincial governor and spy chief traveling in the convoy were unharmed.The Taliban have ramped up their attacks on security forces and government facilities in recent months, while Afghan and U.S. troops have increased operations against the militants' field commanders.Military sources say around 35 members of the country's security forces are killed every day in attacks and clashes.This is while the U.S. is still considering a significant troop drawdown in Afghanistan. Around 14,000 U.S. troops are stationed in the country, coupled with around 7,500 troops from other allied nations, according to RAND, a U.S. government research organization.In a report on Sunday, RAND said that if the U.S. considers \"an early and complete or near-complete departure unrelated to a negotiated peace settlement,\" it could push Afghanistan into a civil war while the Taliban would expand their control throughout the country.If the withdrawal does take place, RAND noted, \"the major advances that Afghans have achieved in democracy, press freedom, human rights, women's emancipation, literacy, longevity, and living standards will be rolled back throughout the country.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Killer The Taliban <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place training center <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack the assault  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target campus <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shot <extra_id_0> Target soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker gunmen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place campus <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Place complex <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize saw <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject bodies <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Identifier he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack suicide bombing <extra_id_0> Place southeastern <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim 10 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim policemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target convoy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact been in touch <extra_id_0> Participant official <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation transported <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact bodies <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination Kabul city <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation transferred <extra_id_0> Destination hospitals <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact injured <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place complex <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounding <extra_id_0> Victim expatriates <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice car bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place highly fortified compound <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact met <extra_id_0> Participant Taliban <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Qatar <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic bringing an end <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack war  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Killer They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim beloved and honest sons <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Injurer They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim beloved and honest sons <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

Well, here it is in black and white. It\u2019s an admission. They have got to do something with this information.\u201dThe Birmingham pub bombings - The 28 numbers that add up to a cover-up, say campaignersMr Conway, now a criminal lawyer in Dublin, says in the book that where off-duty soldiers were the targets of bombings \u201cI had little sympathy for either the soldiers or the unfortunate civilians who had been sharing their drinking space.\u201dHe continued: \u201cThe Birmingham bombs were another matter.\"The bombings came after British police disrupted funeral arrangements for James McDade, a volunteer who had himself died in a premature explosion in England.\u201cTempers were high and I, for one, certainly at first feared that the local IRA had knowingly caused these dreadful casualties \u2013 21 people were killed and a great many others injured.\u201d\u201cI was appalled and personally ashamed of the bombing, which went against everything we claimed to stand for.\u201dHe said he told two other senior IRA figures, Dave O\u2019Connell and Kevin Mallon \u201cexactly what I thought\u201d when they met up.\u201cIn fact, both men were themselves furious, fully recognising not just the damage the bombing had caused to the IRA but its immorality as well.\u201dMcDade, a lieutenant in the Birmingham Brigade of the IRA, blew himself up while trying to plant a bomb at Coventry Telephone exchange a week before the pub bombings.Neither The Mulberry Bush nor The Tavern in The Town had any military connection.Normal IRA procedure at the time for any attack on non-military targets was to give a 30-minute warning in order for full evacuations to take place.Read our docudrama minute-by-minute recreation of the events of November 21 1974The Birmingham Mail received an ambiguous call at 8.11pm on November 21. The caller did not identify either pub, referring instead to The Rotunda, above The Mulberry Bush and the New Street Tax Office, which was above the underground Tavern in The Town.The first bomb destroyed The Mulberry Bush just six minutes later. The Tavern was destroyed at 8.27pm.Conway was not directly involved in the debrief with the England Operational Commander.But he said he was later told \u201cthat the early indications were that the casualties were the result of yet another failure in the warning system, a succession of phone boxes from which the warning might have been relayed having proved to be inoperable.\u201dIn an interview with a national newspaper he described the Birmingham pub bombings as \u201ca total disaster.\u201dHe added that the secret \u2018Feakle Talks\u2019, held a couple of weeks after the bombings, were used by the IRA to try to start to repair its image after the Birmingham and the Guildford pub bombings.The talks, in Feakle, County Clare, involved senior IRA officials and Protestant clergymen and ended abruptly after a tip-off that Irish Special Branch officers were on their way to arrest the republicans.But they set in train a process that eventually led to a brief ceasefire that began on December 22, 1974.Conway had been recruited in 1970, having been radicalised during the 1968 student protest movements.He met with senior republicans, including future deputy first minister of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness and Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams.Adams continues to deny that he was ever in the IRA.Conway was later jailed in Belfast\u2019s notorious Crumlin Road prison and went on hunger strike to achieve political status.Although he left the IRA in 1975, he rejoined during the 1981 hunger strike, then finally broke with the republican movement for good in 1993 when the British and Irish governments announced the Downing Street Declaration.He claimed the declaration basically reinforced partition.\u201cThe IRA went on ceasefire, it decommissioned and did all the things they said they would never do, and disappeared into history,\u201d he said.\u201cIt was a complete and utter defeat, absolutely.\u201dIn his book he also claims that rogue Irish police officers colluded with the IRA throughout the Troubles and that members of the Dublin establishment, including several mainstream politicians, aided the Provisionals in their armed campaign.* Southside

Investigators are treating the blast as a possible terror attack.\"A suspect has been arrested,\" French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner, wrote on Twitter. He later said a second man had been detained.Lyon mayor Gerard Collomb, a former interior minister, said one of the suspects was an IT student student who was arrested as he disembarked a bus.Later, French authorities said that a police raid was under way in the Oullins suburb south of Lyon, a few hours after the arrest of the IT student, reportedly a 24-year-old Algerian.Interior Minister Castaner had told prefects in the country to step up security measures in places frequented by people, such as sports or cultural events following Friday's attack.

A police source said the package contained \"screws or bolts.\"The Paris prosecutor's office, which has jurisdiction over terrorist investigations in France, confirmed that one of the arrested men is the suspected bomber. He is accused of \"attempted murder in relation with a terrorist undertaking\" and \"criminal terrorist association.\"Police had earlier described the suspect as a European or North African male in his early 30s, saying that he had fled the scene on a mountain bike.President Emmanuel Macron called the explosion an \"attack\" but no group has claimed responsibility for the explosion.France has been on high-alert since the \"Islamic State\" militant group launched a series of attacks across Paris, killing 130 people and injuring scores more.Eiffel Tower fenced off to guard against terror attacks Setting sun over the City of Lights The Eiffel Tower, France's most iconic symbol, is getting a wrap-around fencing that will protect the 1,063 foot (324 meters) tower from an array of potential terror attacks. The thick, bullet-proof, glass is not only intended to guard against gunfire but is supposed to be strong enough keep suicide-minded truck drivers from reaching the tower's base.Eiffel Tower fenced off to guard against terror attacks The glass and the tower The bulletproof glass is 6.5 cm (2.5 inches) thick, and will run along at least two sides of the tower: the riverside Quai Branly boulevard and the Avenue Gustave Eiffel, which separates the tower from a park.Eiffel Tower fenced off to guard against terror attacks A metal barrier, too Two sides of the tower are being fenced off with curved metal prongs. The fencing will be 3.24 meters high - exactly one one-hundreth of the height of the Eiffel Tower.Eiffel Tower fenced off to guard against terror attacks Tightening security in aftermath of attacks Once upon a time tourists could walk straight up to the iconic tower without any barriers. But France remains on high alert following a series of deadly terror attacks that have killed more than 240 people since 2015.Eiffel Tower fenced off to guard against terror attacks Under construction The construction of a bulletproof glass barrier along one side of the Eiffel Tower is part of a broader \u20ac35 million ($41 million) security project.Eiffel Tower fenced off to guard against terror attacks The tower and the glass In addition to the new barrier, anti-terror troops patrol the tower and its surroundings. The forecourt, underneath the tower, has been protected by temporary fencing since June 2016.Eiffel Tower fenced off to guard against terror attacks Enduring appeal? The barrier is not expected to dent tourists' enthusiasm for the iconic site. As many as 7 million people are expected to visit the Eiffel Tower in 2018.Eiffel Tower fenced off to guard against terror attacks Putting up a barrier The security barrier, which should be completed in mid-July, is also part of a \u20ac300 million revamp of the Eiffel Tower itself. Most of the work is scheduled to be completed ahead of the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.Eiffel Tower fenced off to guard against terror attacks In the beginning The tower is named after Gustave Eiffel, whose engineering company designed and built the structure from 1887-89. It initially served as the entrance to the World's Fair and marked the 100th anniversary of the start of the French Revolution.kw, shs/ng (AP, AFP, Reuters)Every evening, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

{"text": "Boston Bomb Suspect Sent to Federal Medical DetentionBoston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been moved to a prison medical facility as authorities continue to search for answers about the attack.The U.S. Marshals Service said Friday that Tsarnaev was moved to the Federal Medical Center Devens, a Bureau of Prisons facility in the northeastern state of Massachusetts. He was transferred there from a Boston hospital where he had been receiving treatment for injuries sustained during his capture last week.Federal Medical Center Devens, Ayer, MassachusettsA spokesman did not give details about the condition of the 19-year-old, who officials say is recovering from a neck wound.Tsarnaev's brother and alleged co-conspirator, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died in a confrontation with police last week.Also Friday, FBI agents searched a landfill near the campus of the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student. Officials did not say what investigators were looking for.In Washington, lawmakers said that authorities are trying to determine whether or not the brothers' mother was involved in the radicalization of her two sons. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Dutch Ruppersberger, said she is a \"person of interest.\"The Associated Press reported Friday that the bombing suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, had been added to a federal terrorism database about 18 months before the Boston attack.In Russia, Tsarnaeva and her former husband, Anzor, said Thursday their sons did not carry out the Boston attack that killed three people and injured more than 250 others. In a news conference in Makhachkala, the parents said their sons were framed, and the mother accused U.S. authorities of needlessly killing Tamerlan.\"What have you done with my son? He was alive. Why did they need to kill him? Why didn't they send him to, you know, Guantanamo or wherever? Why did they kill him? Why? Why did they have to kill him? They got him alive, right? He was in their hands,'' she said.Tsarnaeva said she would not accept that her sons had planted the bombs.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev faces a charge of using a weapon of mass destruction, which carries a possible death sentence if he is convicted.New York officials say the suspects were devising a plan to attack Times Square as they were running from authorities. New York Police Chief Ray Kelly said Dzhokhar told investigators they planned to drive to New York to set off their remaining explosives.He said the plan fell apart when they realized the vehicle they had hijacked was running low on gas. When they stopped to refuel, the driver of the car escaped, and alerted police to their location.New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the incident shows that New York, which was hit by terrorist attacks in 2001 that killed nearly 3,000 people, remains an inviting target.\"The fact is New York City remains a prime target for those who hate America and want to kill Americans,\" said Bloomberg.U.S. officials are continuing to examine whether the Boston Marathon attack could have been prevented, as warning signs emerged that Tamerlan was turning toward extremism.Senator Lindsey Graham said he believes Boston is becoming \"a case study in system failure\" by U.S. intelligence agencies.\u201cWe need to understand that Bin Laden may be dead, but the war against radical Islam is very much alive. Radical Islam is on the march and we need to up our game,\u201d said Graham.Authorities say Tamerlan Tsarnaev was placed on a U.S. counter-terrorism list in late 2011.The officials say the CIA asked that his name be placed on the list after the agency was contacted by the Russian government with its concerns that he had become a radical Islamist.Moscow also issued a similar warning on him to the FBI earlier in 2011. Officials say the agency launched an investigation, but eventually concluded he posed no threat.U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns about information sharing between U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon attack. Authorities will brief the full U.S. Senate on the investigation into the bombing.Several months after he first came to the attention of U.S. federal agents, Tamerlan Tsarnaev left the U.S. in January 2012 for a six-month visit to Russia. U.S. investigators questioned the suspects' parents in the Russian republic of Dagestan to try to determine if Tamerlan had contacts with Islamic extremists.

{"text": "A statement after a two-hour emergency meeting at Stormont Castle, said that Mr Whitelaw, the defence secretary, Lord Carrington, and army and civilian advisers, had considered the Provisional IRA's \"bombing outrages\".\"They deplored the slaughter and maiming of men, women and children, which took place today on Provisional IRA orders, clearly acting with the utmost ferocity. In the light of these murderous attacks, the ministers authorised certain operations against the terrorists to be undertaken forthwith.\"Early today Mr Whitelaw gave an interview to the BBC about forthcoming security measures. He said: \"I am going to make an immediate and clear response to the ghastly attacks on innocent people that have taken place in the last 24 hours.\"This will be a clearly determined operation that will do everything possible to root out those responsible for these appalling crimes.\" He added that the measures would become apparent \"very soon\".On the question of the possible reintroduction of internment, he said: \"The internment of suspects is never ruled out, but I don't contemplate it with any pleasure.\"Shootings in Belfast had continued last night. In one incident, a man was killed and five more were wounded, in a battle between troops and terrorists in the Markets area. The army claimed to have hit three gunmen.Later, a man was shot dead when he answered a knock at his door in Deerpark Road, in the Old Park district of the city.Just after 11.30pm a wave of shooting broke out in the main Catholic areas. The army said that the initial shooting incidents did not involve the security forces, but that after midnight their posts in Anderstown and the Old Park Road came under intense gunfire. There were no military casualties.In the afternoon, during an hour of concentrated bombing at least 11 people died. They included two soldiers, a little girl and a messenger boy. Ninety six people were detained in hospital, and about 24 others were allowed home after treatment.The Provisional IRA accepted responsibility for the bombings, which seemed to be aimed at civilians. It claimed that at least 30 minutes' warning was given before each explosion, but the warnings which were received were so vague as to be almost useless.A spokesman for the Belfast Brigade of the Provisional IRA pointed out that telephoned warnings were given to the Samaritans, the police, newspapers and the local Rumour Service and Public Protection Service at least thirty minutes before each explosion. In the case of the two worst explosions at Oxford Street and the Cavehill Road, warnings were given well in advance. The Oxford Street warning was heard over the military radio net at 2.10pm, and a woman telephoned the police telling of a box in the back of a car on the Cavehill Road an hour before the explosion.Huge explosive decides were detonated at places certain to be thronged with people - bus termini, railway stations, and shopping centres. It was calculated that over 1,000lb of explosives had been used.At 2.45pm, when the bombing began, and for much of the afternoon, Belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic.Girls and men wept openly, hugging each other for safety in the main streets, as plumes of smoke rose around them, and dull thuds echoed from wall to wall.It was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe. As each bomb exploded there were cries of terror from people who thought they had found sanctuary, but in fact were just as exposed as before.Thousands streamed out of the stricken city immediately after the attacks, and huge traffic jams built up. All bus services were cancelled, and on some roads hitch hikers frantically trying to get away lined the pavements.By the time it was all over, some 21 bombs had gone off in Belfast and there were fears of more to come. Sources close to the Provisionals indicated that more were planned for last night and for the weekend.Mr Whitelaw and Lord Carrington immediately flew back to Belfast in an RAF transport plane for their emergency meeting. The army GOC, Sir Harry Tuzo, the acting chief of the RUC, Mr David Corbett, and one of Mr Whitelaw's juniors, Mr David Howell, also attended.From at least two Ulster Protestant politicians, there were urgent demands last night for an immediate resumption of the internment policy. One of them, Mr William Craig, leader of Ulster Vanguard, and a former Stormont Cabinet Minister, called for its \"immediate massive resumption\".While this course was not thought one of those Mr Whitelaw was more likely to pursue, it was felt that stringent security measures must now be enforced.The possibility that a major cordon-and-search operation may now be undertaken in one of the prime Republican areas - possibly even in the Andersonstown estate where the Belfast IRA leaders meet and plan their main operations - is becoming very real indeed.If Mr Whitelaw does not act swiftly, there is little doubt here that understandably militant Protestants, headed by the huge and formidably well disciplined Ulster Defence Association, may decide to take the law into their own hands.Last night the UDA leaders were meeting in emergency session in a house in the city and refused to comment on their plans. They did stress, however, that no action was contemplated for some hours. But only four hours after the bombing, UDA car and foot patrols were seen on the streets in East Belfast. Presumably they were there in a defensive role for a very frightened and intimidated Protestant population.The bombs began to explode before 3pm. Then for roughly 20 minutes they exploded roughly at one a minute. Smoke appeared in all directions above the roofs of shops and offices. As the attacks continued, and the whole city centre echoed to the crack of the bombs, a few people began to panic. Weeping children had to be comforted by their mothers, and passers-by had to strike hysterical girls to bring them under control.The worst explosion was at the busy Oxford Street bus station, where at least six people were killed. Reports by witnesses said that the bomb had been planted in a car.

{"text": "Boston Marathon Bomber\u2019s Life Hangs in the Balance BOSTON \u2014\u00a0He\u2019s a charmer. He\u2019s a slacker. He\u2019s bright. He\u2019s a victim of culture shock, a broken family and a domineering older brother. He\u2019s a murderer. He\u2019s a terrorist.That\u2019s the picture presented in recent days of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as his defense lawyers neared the end of their effort to save their client\u2019s life. As early as Monday, the defense may rest their case and put their faith in the 12-person jury, which will decide whether he should die or live.Tsarnaev, 21, was convicted last month of 30 terrorism and other related charges for his role in the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. U.S. law requires that the jury must return a unanimous decision in order to execute a person, and it is that chance \u2013 that one juror will decide against the death penalty \u2013 where Tsarnaev\u2019s lawyers are placing their hopes.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, shown in January 2007, holding the daughter of his grade school teacherThree people died in the attack, including an 8-year-old boy, and more than 260 were wounded. Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, killed a police officer several days later just prior to a car chase and shootout that left Tamerlan dead.Penalty PhaseThe two-part trial entered the \u201cpenalty\u201d phase April 21, as prosecutors sought to paint Tsarnaev as a willing accomplice in the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001.Defense lawyers portrayed their client as a malleable participant, under the sway of Tamerlan, who they said was the mastermind and leader.\u201cThe whole goal of the defense is \u2026 to make the jury see the defendant as a vulnerable human being,\u201d said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center.\u201cThe jury doesn\u2019t have to like him,\u201d he said. \u201cThe jury doesn\u2019t have to want to have him over to their house for dinner. They just have to decide that putting him away in a dark hole for the rest of his life is an acceptable punishment.\u201dAs with the previous phase, the courtroom has been whipsawed by testimony, by turns infuriating, wrenching, maddening or saddening.Prosecutors stunned spectators and jurors in their opening arguments for the death penalty by juxtaposing photographs: of the youngest victim, 8-year-old Martin Richard, and that of Tsarnaev, making an obscene gesture to a video camera in the prison cell where he\u2019s being held.\u201cThis is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged,\u201d federal prosecutor Nadine Pellegrini told jurors.Courtroom TearsOn Monday, less than two weeks later, the courtroom filled with sobbing, when Tsarnaev\u2019s aunt, Patimat Suleimanova, flown from Russia, wracked with tears, tried to speak about her nephew whom she hadn\u2019t seen in more than a decade.During the weeks that the trial has been ongoing, Tsarnaev, who spent his childhood shuttling between Russia and Kyrgyzstan and then his formative years in a three-bedroom, third-floor apartment in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has been largely impassive and at times appearing bored.On Monday, after listening to his aunt, he himself broke down for the first time, rubbing his eyes with his fists and openly weeping.Not long after, as he was being led from the courtroom during a break, he blew a kiss to a cousin who was in attendance.South Boston resident Joe Kebartas, holding a sign reading \"Death Penalty is Murder,\" demonstrates outside the federal courthouse where Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been convicted on all 30 counts, April 8, 2015.More than 40 witnesses appeared during the penalty phase, including some of Tsarnaev\u2019s former school teachers and college friends, some crying openly. During her appeareance in court on April 29, one former teacher, Becki Norris, smiled at Tsarnaev, and he returned the smile.Later, she posted a photograph on Facebook of 12-year-old Tsarnaev holding her newborn daughter.\u201cWhen you care deeply for someone, that doesn't stop even if they do unfathomably horrible things. We humans are really good at holding two irreconcilable ideas in our psyches at the same time. Yes, he did the unforgivable. And yes, I still love him. And \u2013 this one is hard to fathom, I know \u2013 he still needs love,\u201d Norris wrote on her Facebook page.Death penalty decisionThe decision by the Obama administration to seek the death penalty for Tsarnaev has been controversial. Massachusetts state law does not allow for capital punishment, but Tsarnaev is being tried in federal court.Support for the death penalty in the state has never been strong, and public opinion polls taken by Boston-area media in the months prior to and during the trial have shown dwindling enthusiasm.On the eve of the final phase, the Boston Globe published a front-page letter from Martin Richard\u2019s family, in which they called for sentencing Tsarnaev to life in prison.This undated photo provided by Bill Richard shows his son, Martin Richard, who was among the at least three people killed in the explosions at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, Apr. 15, 2013.\u201cAs long as the defendant is in the spotlight, we have no choice but to live a story told on his terms, not ours,\u201d the family wrote. \u201cThe minute the defendant fades from our newspapers and TV screens is the minute we begin the process of rebuilding our lives and our family.\u201dAt the beginning of Tsarnaev\u2019s trial, his defense, led by renowned lawyer Judy Clarke, conceded his guilt, in what appeared to be a strategy focused more on saving his life. \u201cThis is the theory: that no person is only the worse thing they\u2019ve done in their life,\u201d said Quin Denvir, a former federal defender who worked with Clarke in gaining a life prison sentence for Theodore Kaczynski, the \u201cUnabomber,\u201d in a federal trial in 1998.\u201cIt\u2019s all part of letting the jury seeing the person as a human being, not just the perpetrator of a crime, but as a fully developed human being, with strengths and weaknesses,\u201d Denvir said.In addition to calling relatives and experts on Chechnya\u2019s tortured history, lawyers have called witnesses to argue that the prison where Tsarnaev would live out the rest of his life \u2013 the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Colorado \u2013 would be harsh and unforgiving.It is \u201ca mechanism to cut off an inmate\u2019s communications with the outside world,\u201d defense witness Mark Bezy testified on Wednesday.Tsarnaev\u2019s parents, Anzor and Zubeidat, were not called to testify. Both now live in Dagestan, the Russian region bordering Chechnya, and have not returned the United States since just after Tsarnaev\u2019s initial court appearance in 2013.Russian Hunger For NewsWith the Tsarnaev family\u2019s ties to Russia and the North Caucasus, there\u2019s been intense interest in the trial for many Russians, according to Alexei Venediktov, the editor-in-chief of Ekho Moskvy, an influential, independent radio station and Web site in Moscow.The proceedings, however, have received virtually no coverage in the Russian news media, nearly all of which is state-controlled. Venediktov told VOA that\u2019s probably because of growing concern from the Kremlin about stability in the long-troubled North Caucasus.\u201cThis process carries an unpleasant association, I think, for the leadership, in particular, of the Russian Federation, and therefore, I think, it\u2019s possible there\u2019s been embargo on news,\u201d he said. He also said support is growing in Russia to bring back the death penalty, and were the Boston jury to sentence him to death, it would have a significant impact on the Russian debate.\u201cI think the jury\u2019s verdict will be actively discussed in Russia if it ends up being the death penalty,\u201d he said.Tlisova reported from Boston; Eckel reported from Washington.

{"text": "US Arrests Focus on Terrorism FightNEW YORK \u2014\u00a0Disturbing allegations were contained in court papers describing the latest homegrown terror plot thwarted by the FBI and the New York Police Department.Noelle Velentzas and Asia Siddiqui were arrested at their Queens homes early Thursday following a sting operation using an undercover officer wearing a wire. The officer searching the homes recovered items including three gas tanks, a pressure cooker, fertilizer, jihadist literature and handwritten notes on the recipes for bomb making, court papers say.Velentzas had been \"obsessed with pressure cookers since the Boston Marathon attacks in 2013'' and made jokes alluding to explosives after receiving one as a gift, according to a criminal complaint citing one of the secret recordings made by the undercover agent who befriended the pair.Fighting 'homegrown violent extremists'The women\u2019s arrests show U.S. authorities \u201care committed to doing everything in our ability to detect, disrupt and deter attacks by homegrown violent extremists,'' U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement. \u201cAs alleged, the defendants in this case carefully studied how to construct an explosive device to launch an attack on the homeland.''In this courtroom sketch, Muhanad Mahmoud Al Farekh, with beard, appears in federal court in New York April 2, 2015. Authorities say he planned to kill American soldiers.Their arrests came the same day as another U.S. citizen was brought from Pakistan to New York to face charges he supported a conspiracy to kill Americans. Texas-born Muhanad Mahmoud Al Farekh appeared Thursday in Brooklyn federal court and was held without bail.The women also were held without bail after a brief court appearance, where they spoke only to say they understood the charges against them. Velentzas, 28, wore a hijab and a dark dress, and Siddiqui, 31, had on a green T-shirt with a long-sleeved black shirt underneath and a dark long skirt.Siddiqui\u2019s lawyer, Thomas Dunn, said his client \"will enter a plea of not guilty, if and when there is an indictment.\"Velentzas' attorney had no comment.The complaint cites a poem written by Siddiqui that appeared in a magazine published by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. It declared there is \"no excuse to sit back and wait for the skies [to] rain martyrdom,'' investigators wrote in court papers.Velentzas called al-Qaida\u2019s founder, the late Osama bin Laden, one of her heroes, and said she and Siddiqui were \"citizens of the Islamic State,\" investigators said.Research methodsAccording to the complaint, the women \"researched and acquired some of the components of a car bomb, like the one used in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; a fertilizer bomb, like the one used in the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City; and a pressure cooker bomb, like the one used in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing,'' authorities wrote.After two New York City police officers were gunned down in a patrol car in December, Velentzas told the undercover officer that the deaths showed it was easy to kill a police officer, the complaint said.After the undercover officer mentioned that 25,000 officers had turned out for the first of the funerals for the two officers, Velentzas \u201ccomplimented'' the officer for coming up with an attractive target and considered whether the other funeral was an appropriate target, it added.The complaints suggests that authorities decided to make the arrests after Siddiqui came into \u201cpossession of multiple propane gas tanks, as well as instructions for how to transform propane tanks into explosive devices,\u201d and told the undercover she was \u201cdisinclined\u201d to talk about her plans.\u201cIt is very, very important to note: There was never any imminent threat to our fellow New Yorkers,'' Mayor Bill de Blasio said when asked about the case. The plot, he added, \"was undercut before it could turn into something dangerous.''Siddiqui\u2019s neighbors said she and her brother lived in the basement of a red-brick three floor house owned by their parents, who didn't live there.\u201cShe was quiet, and I never thought she could do this,'' said Mohammad Shahidul Haque, a retired hospital lab tech.Other plot reportedly hatched in Canada As for Al Farekh, he and two other co-conspirators were students at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, in 2007 when authorities say they started watching al-Qaida propaganda and hatching a plan to become martyrs abroad, an FBI agent wrote in a January complaint.Al Farekh and the two others flew to Karachi, Pakistan, on round-trip tickets in March 2007 after selling their belongings, disconnecting their phones and buying mountain boots that authorities say are commonly worn by al-Qaida fighters in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the complaint says.His lawyer did not comment.President Barack Obama has nominated Lynch to become the nation\u2019s next attorney general, though her confirmation has been held up in the U.S. Senate.

{"text": "Accused New York City Bomber Pleads Not GuiltyAccused New York bomber Ahmad Khan Rahimi pleaded not guilty on Thursday to federal charges that he set off an explosive device in September on a crowded city street, injuring 30 people.Wearing a dark blue jump suit, Rahimi, 28, shuffled slowly into federal court in Manhattan and had several coughing fits during the brief hearing. He suffered serious injuries in a shootout with police two days after the bombing.He spoke only once, when U.S. District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight-count indictment filed on Wednesday.\"Yes, sir,\" Rahimi said.Prosecutors have accused the Afghan-born U.S. citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Sept. 17. It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people.The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey, although that detonation did not injure anyone.Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey.In addition to the New York indictment, Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey.He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds, delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed.Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi's movements on the day of the bombings, including leaving his house carrying bags, walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street.He also said the government has records showing Rahimi purchased bomb components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs.Lewin asked Berman to consider a trial date in the \"late winter\" or \"early spring,\" saying the amount of evidence in the case is relatively limited. Berman scheduled court dates for Dec. 19 and Jan. 31 but has not set a trial date.Rahimi's court-appointed defense lawyers declined to comment after the hearing.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges <extra_id_0> Defendant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injurer he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing hearing <extra_id_0> Place court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt Manhattan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack setting off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosion <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Prosecutors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Victim anyone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure hurt <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack went off <extra_id_0> Attacker Rahimi <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injure <extra_id_0> Victim anyone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack go off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice devices <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges <extra_id_0> Prosecutor prosecutors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant Rahimi <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain captured <extra_id_0> Detainee He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounds <extra_id_0> Victim him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack went off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Rahimi <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell purchased <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing hearing <extra_id_0> Defendant Rahimi <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Thai Authorities Indict 2 Over August Shrine AttackA Bangkok military court has indicted two men accused of carrying out the August 17 bombing at a popular shrine that killed 20 people.The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast, including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder.Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror, and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism.Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained. They are described as ethnic Uighurs, a minority group based in China's Xinjiang region. They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September.Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people-smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation.The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades, and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured. Of the dead, 14 were tourists.The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness, which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror. Authorities, however, have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country's huge tourism industry.Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss, but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests. Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others.The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb. Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived, said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai.Doubts about motiveEarly speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that Thailand in July forcibly repatriated more than 100 Uighurs to China, where it is feared they face persecution. The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists, who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing.But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive, sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human-smuggling gang. Still, skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks, contradictions, misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation.The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of \u201cnational security\u201d have been handled by the military since last May, when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government.Former National Police Chief Somyot Poomphanmuang said before his retirement in September that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed-circuit television footage, witnesses, DNA matching and physical evidence, in addition to their confessions.Security camera footage from the Erawan Shrine showed a man wearing a yellow T-shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine, took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away. Time stamps on closed circuit TV footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred, during evening rush hour as the area in central Bangkok was filled with people.Police believe that Bilal is the yellow-shirted man who planted the bomb and Yusufu is believed to have detonated the bomb.Bilal, was initially identified as Adem Karadag, which was the name on a fake Turkish passport in his possession when he was arrested Aug. 29. He was arrested at one of two apartments police raided on the outskirts of Bangkok.Yusufu was arrested Sept. 1 near the Thai-Cambodia border, carrying a Chinese passport indicating he was from Xinjiang. Police said his DNA and fingerprints were found in both raided apartments, including on a container of gunpowder.Police said they have confessions from the two, and Bilal's lawyer says his client admitted planting the deadly bomb at the behest of another suspect who remains a fugitive. He says Bilal was induced to carry out the action by a promise that his emigration to Turkey would be expedited.Some material for this report came from AP.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict Indict <extra_id_0> Defendant 2 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Prosecutor Authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack Attack <extra_id_0> Place Shrine <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict indicted <extra_id_0> Defendant men <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Prosecutor court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place shrine <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict indicted <extra_id_0> Defendant Mieraili Yusufu <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Prosecutor court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain detained <extra_id_0> Detainee Bilal <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrests <extra_id_0> Detainee They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant officials <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast <extra_id_0> Attacker gang <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast <extra_id_0> Place Erawan Shrine <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 120 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim 14 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrests  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack raids  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact claimed <extra_id_0> Participant Police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict indictments <extra_id_0> Defendant suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation arrived <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation repatriated <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Uighurs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transporter Thailand <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination China <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target victims <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reject <extra_id_0> Participant officials <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place shrine <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact explanation <extra_id_0> Participant police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing tried <extra_id_0> Defendant suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place base <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Somyot Poomphanmuang <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation left <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin shrine <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Yusufu <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Yusufu <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact says <extra_id_0> Participant He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact declined <extra_id_0> Participant Authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Chuchart Kanpai <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

But as Colombia\u2019s conflict has wound down, and the nation\u2019s largest rebel group disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Smouldering remains of car bomb are seen in this screengrab outside Bogot\u00e1 police academy.Authorities have yet to suggest who was behind the attack, but attention has focused on leftist rebels from the National Liberation Army, ELN, which has been stepping up attacks on police targets in Colombia amid a standoff with the conservative Duque over how to restart stalled peace talks.Colombian rebels blamed for killing spree 400 miles inside Venezuela Read moreThe group known was long considered a lesser military threat than the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), whose 7,000 guerrilla fighters disarmed as part of a 2016 peace accord. But in the wake of the peace deal, the Cuban-inspired insurgency has been gaining strength, especially along the eastern border with Venezuela, where it has carried out a number of kidnappings and bombings of oil pipelines. That has hardened Duque\u2019s resolve in refusing to resume peace talks that have been stalled since he took office last August.Thursday\u2019s bombing was the deadliest in the capital since an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary\u2019s Movement for the bombing.But it has been more than a decade since a police or military installation in the capital has suffered a major bombing. A blast at a military university in 2006 left almost two dozen people injured.Ariel \u00c1vila, an analyst who tracks violence, said that in the last four years, there have been 28 attacks in the capital with explosives.

{"text": "Boston Marathon Bomber Apologizes to SurvivorsBOSTON \u2014\u00a0Moments before a federal judge sentenced him to death, Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev rose to his feet Wednesday and apologized to the victims and their loved ones for the first time.\"I pray for your relief, for your healing,'' he said.Amid deep silence in the courtroom, the 21-year-old ethnic Chechen said, \"I am sorry for the lives that I've taken, for the suffering that I've caused you, for the damage that I've done \u2014 irreparable damage.''It was the first time Tsarnaev, who did not speak in his own defense at trial, had addressed the court.After Tsarnaev finished, U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr. began to speak, with his voice breaking several times. He officially imposed the death sentence on Tsarnaev that jurors had recommended unanimously.In May, after a 12-week trial, Tsarnaev was found guilty of killing three people and injuring 264 in the April 15, 2013, bombing at the world-renowned race, where he and his brother, Tamerlan, 26, set off two pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line.Tsarnaev was also found guilty in the fatal shooting of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer three days later as he and his brother fled. Tamerlan was killed during the getaway.Tsarnaev was found guilty of all 30 terrorism and other charges against him. Of those, 17 carried the possibility of a death sentence.During the penalty phase of the judicial proceedings, prosecutors brushed off defense arguments that Tsarnaev was under the strong influence of his older, radicalized brother.Victims speak outBefore the sentencing, a somber-looking Tsarnaev, wearing a dark sport jacket with a collared shirt and no tie, sat between his lawyers and listened as 24 people \u2014 some victims, some survivors \u2014 gave impact statements. They lashed out at him for his \u201ccowardly\u201d and \u201cdisgusting\u201d acts, and several called upon him to apologize, trying to convince him that this would be his last chance to ask for forgiveness.Tsarnaev, his chair turned toward the lectern from which the victims spoke, picked at his beard and gazed downward most of the time, only occasionally looking at the speakers.Patricia Campbell, the mother of Krystle Campbell, 29, who was killed in the attack, was the first person to address the court. She looked across the room at Tsarnaev, seated about 20 feet away, and spoke directly to him.\u201cWhat you did to my daughter is disgusting,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't know what to say to you. I think the jury did the right thing.\u201dKrystle Campbell's best friend, Karen Rand McWatters, who lost a leg in the attack, said Tsarnaev \"can't possibly have had a soul to do such a horrible thing.\u201dIn a message he scrawled in the boat he was found hiding in, Tsarnaev said the attack was retaliation against the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries. McWatters urged Tsarnaev to show remorse to discourage other jihadis from killing people in similar attacks. \u201cYou can save them from these cowardly acts if you really have an ounce of regret,\u201d she said.Rebekah Gregory, a Texas woman who lost a leg in the bombing, defiantly told Tsarnaev she was not his victim.\u201cWhile your intention was to destroy America, what you have really accomplished is actually quite the opposite \u2014 you've unified us,\u201d she said. \"We are Boston strong, we are America strong, and choosing to mess with us was a terrible idea. So how's that for your VICTIM impact statement?\u201d'He is a leech'Several victims condemned Tsarnaev for coming to the U.S. as an immigrant from Russia, enjoying the benefits of living here and then attacking American citizens.\u201cHe is a leech, abusing the privilege of American freedom, and he spit in the face of the American dream,\u201d said Jennifer Rogers, an older sister of slain MIT Officer Sean Collier.Bill Richard, whose 8-year-old son, Martin, was the youngest person killed in the bombing, said Tsarnaev could have backed out of the plot and reported his brother to authorities. Instead, Richard said, \u201che chose hate. He chose destruction. He chose death. This is all on him.\u201dRichard noted that his family would have preferred that Tsarnaev receive a life sentence so that he could have had \u201ca lifetime to reconcile with himself what he did that day.\u201dRichard said his family has chosen love, kindness and peace, adding: \u201cThat is what makes us different than him.\u201dFatima Tlisova of VOA's Russian service contributed to this report from Boston.

{"text": "Scotland Yard are searching for a group of about five people, including a \"baby faced\" teenage youth, in the wake of two bomb explosions at King's Cross and Euston stations in London yesterday.Thirteen people were injured, three seriously, in the lunchtime explosions. The attacks are the latest in the Provisional IRA's three week old bombing campaign in England carried out by small active service units. At King's Cross a 15 to 17-year-old youth ran on to Platform 8 and threw a brown paper parcel into the entrance of the old booking hall at 12.24 p.m.The youth described by one of the five injured in the blast as baby faced and \"too young to shave\" sprinted out of the station seconds before the 3lb. bomb exploded. A coded call gave police a three-minute warning of a second bomb at Euston which exploded at 1.16 p.m. in the Railbar injuring eight people.Scotland Yard said that the call, telephoned to the Press Association news agency was in the name of the same group which has given warnings about previous bombs in London. The caller, a man with an Irish accent, is believed to be responsible for all the warnings.Commander Robert Huntley, who is heading the investigation said the name of the group used in the calls enabled Scotland Yard to distinguish the real warnings from the hundreds of hoax calls. He would not disclose the code name but denied that the code name \"Persuaders\" - given to Birmingham police before the blast on Sunday night - had been used in London.The Commander attacked the hoax callers who were responsible yesterday for the closure of most main line stations in London while bomb searches were made.Charing Cross Station was evacuated after an anonymous bomb warning to the Sloane telephone exchange at 4.55p.m. After a search, passengers were allowed back at 5.30.Euston was also cleared after receiving a rush-hour threat. Other searches were made after calls to Paddington, Waterloo and London Bridge.Mr Huntley said yesterday's explosions, which followed the weekend attack on Victoria Station, appeared to be similar to the previous bombings and that the devices were \"typical of IRA manufacture.\" A piece of battery and part of a clock spring were found amid the debris at Euston, suggesting the charge had been timed and primed in exactly the same manner as other bombs.The police believe that the IRA are using at least two small squads of bombers operating in London and the Midlands who are almost constantly on the move living in cheap hotels and boarding houses.Asked about previous claims from Commander Ernest Bond that the bombers were close to arrest, Mr Huntley said he did not think the statement had been over-optimistic. Certain evidence had been compiled on those thought to be responsible. He indicated that the gang members were interchangeable and might not even live in this country.Commander Huntley said the bombers' tactics were now clear. The three-minute warning at Euston indicated that the aim of the bomb was \"to cause injury and destruction\" in a crowded station. He appealed for the public not to leave parcels, luggage, and containers unattended in public places but to keep property with them at all times.All those seriously injured yesterday were at Kings Cross - a Chinese couple from Hull and a London man. Mr Anthony Barber, the Chancellor, was sitting in a train which had just arrived when the bomb exploded. He joined the crowd helping the injured and asked if there was anything he could do.Although Scotland Yard are privately convinced that the recent wave of bombings has been the work of the Provisional IRA, police have failed to discover signs of a widespread IRA organisation in England.It seems likely that the bombing teams are either recruited in England, from outside the ranks of republican organisations and sympathisers, or are briefed and armed in Ireland and sent over individually.A small and changing group of four to six people operating alone in the London area without recourse to or contact with known republicans living here has largely neutralised the intelligence gathered by the Special Branch on Irish militants.The fact that the Provisionals' leadership has not yet claimed responsibility from Dublin has little bearing on its involvement. The salient point is that the Provos have always been quick to disclaim responsibility for incidents in which they are not involved and no such disclaimer has been issued.While it might well be true that extremists in England have taken advantage of the confusion created by the bombings to plant their own explosive devices, informed sources in Dublin consider it certain that the present campaign was both planned and approved by the IRA Army Council in Dublin.The explosions have almost certainly gone beyond what the Provisionals had originally intended but they see no reason to help Scotland Yard by claiming or disclaiming responsibility.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack explosions <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target stations <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim three <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim five <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Railbar <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim those <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injury  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle destruction  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact contact <extra_id_0> Participant republicans <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "ISIS Is Reportedly Packing Drones With Explosives NowAn unconfirmed report from Syria suggests that ISIS has started using small drones packed with explosives as weapons.The first attack was a failure, but if the report is accurate, then it signals a dangerous new terror threat.The report showed pictures of the remains of a homemade attack drone.It was apparently shot down, along with a second drone that exploded, by Kurdish YPF (\"People's Defence Units\") fighters in Syria.The caption says that both drones carried explosives, and that no YPF fighters were injured in the incident.Unlike many jihadi groups, ISIS has proven itself tech-savvy\u2014the organization is known for its use of social media, for instance.This latest development is not surprising, as it follows a long history of drone usage.In late 2014, during the battle for Kobane, ISIS started using footage taken from dronesin their propaganda videos.Around the same time, ISIS started using quadrotors for battlefield reconnaissance.A number of them, mainly DJI quadrotors, were reportedly shot down or captured by Kurdish fighters, according to a news report from December 2014.These drones were apparently used as artillery spotters, finding targets and correcting the fall or fire for mortar crews.By early this year, ISIS drones had become important enough to be targeted by U.S. airstrikes.A CENTCOM report in March mentions that \"Near Fallujah, an airstrike destroyed an ISIL remotely piloted aircraft and an ISIL vehicle.\"\"We observed it flying for approximately 20 minutes.We observed it land.We observed the enemy place it in the trunk of a car and we struck the car,\" according to Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren.Warren described the drone as \"a model airplane\" and \"commercially available, remotely piloted aircraft, really something anyone can get.\"Another ISIS drone (\"remotely piloted vehicle\") was destroyed in an airstrike in June, and a third in August.Friends of YPG YPJIn fact, ISIS tactical drones seem to be appearing all over this year.In September the Levant Front (or Jabhat al-Shamiyya) released pictures of a camera-carrying Talon drone they brought down, which they say was flown by ISIS.The X-UAV Talon is available in kit form for about $100; it is made of plywood with a six-foot wingspan and has a large fuselage compartment for cameras or other payloads.In October, Iraqi police shot down a fixed-wing ISIS drone near Ramadi.Again it was of the small, hand-launched variety, though a different model, and the Iraqis say it was photographing military units.Even al-Qaeda has released pictures and video of what is claims was a downed ISIS drone.This flurry of drone activity is a reflection of just how easy it has become to acquire and fly drones.Just as home computers were once confined to dedicated hobbyists but found a wider market, drones have broken into the mainstream with models that require no piloting or technical skills to fly.This gives ISIS access to aerial reconnaissance that would otherwise be impossible in the face of the air superiority of Syrian, Russian, and Western forces.The pictures of the ISIS attack drone were posted by a user called \"Catelyn Carrigan\" on the Facebook page of the group \"Friends of the YPG YPJ\" with the headline \"YPG Shoots Down 2 ISIS Drones.\"The location of the new pictures is given as \"Southern Koban\u00ea, Qracoezag province near the bridge.\"We received no response to queries for more information on the pictures.This would not be the first terrorist drone strike.Hamas and Hezbollah, for example, both have used fixed-wing kamikaze drones with explosive warheads, but those were larger, modified versions of military Mirsad and Ababbil drones supplied by Iran.The ISIS drones do not rely on imported military technology, but can be assembled in a garage, for cheap.Some eagled-eyed redditors believe the drone in question today is the Skwalker X7 or X8, which costs $179 for the kit.As we've recently noted, small drones make effective battlefield weapons.The Switchblade by American company AeroVironment and the Israeli Hero-30 have both proven lethal, giving a foot soldier the power to launch his own airstrike to locate and hit a target from several miles away from behind cover.These military drones boast jam-proof communications, sophisticated terminal guidance, and advanced warheads.But even a crude, home-made version might be deadly in a terrorist attack against a soft target.During the recent terror attacks in Paris, the attackers were unable to gain access to the Stade de France, which was packed with fans for a soccer game.But drones cannot be stopped by walls or fences.While they can only carry a small amount of explosive compared to a suicide bomber, they can be deployed in significant numbers, and they can be directed with great accuracy against vulnerable targets.Of course, security forces are already looking at how to mitigate the threat from small drones, and various defensive measures are already in place, from nets to electronic detectors and jammers.Commercial drones can be stopped easily enough by jamming their control frequencies, or even hacking them to take over the drone, but purpose-built attack drones will be much harder to combat.Small drones can be built for a few thousand dollars in any home workshop.3D printed drones are no longer a novelty, and how-to guides can be shared easily over the internet.It is far too late to stop this technology from proliferating.ISIS first drone attack may have failed, but it is not likely to be the last.It may be time to get serious about defending against small drones.David Hambling's new bookSwarm Troopers: How small drones

{"text": "US Jury to Decide: Death or Life in Prison for Boston Marathon BomberAfter convicting Chechen immigrant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev of the deadly 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, jurors will take a few days off before deciding whether to sentence him to death or life in prison.After two days of deliberations in a federal trial, the jury convicted Tsarnaev Wednesday of all 30 charges he faced, including 17 that carry a possible death penalty. The sentencing phase of the trial, which could begin as early as Monday, will be held in the same U.S. courtroom.Jurors would have to vote unanimously to sentence the 21-year-old to death.The defense lawyers, who barely cross-examined the prosecution's witnesses during the first part of the trial, are expected to become much more aggressive during the penalty phase, when they will make a case that Tsarnaev's life should be spared.ConvictionTsarnaev's conviction was practically a foregone conclusion: His lawyers admitted he participated in the bombings, in which two homemade, shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs were placed near the finish line of the annual race. The explosion killed three people, including an 8-year-old boy, and injured another 264, with 17 people losing limbs and many others maimed from flying shrapnel.But during the trial, defense attorney Judy Clarke argued that Tsarnaev, then 19, fell under the influence of his radicalized older brother, Tamerlan, 26.Clarke, who has successfully kept other notorious U.S. murder convicts off death row, told the jury in her closing argument, \"If not for Tamerlan, it [the bombing] would not have happened.\"Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed days after the April 15, 2013, blasts, when he was shot by police and run over by his brother during a chaotic getaway attempt. The brothers also shot to death a university patrol officer while attempting to flee authorities.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who lived in the United States for a decade before the bombings, was later found hiding in a boat parked in the backyard of a suburban Boston home.Prosecutors said he scrawled a motive for the attack on the inside wall of the boat, writing that the brothers were trying to avenge American attacks on Muslims in the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Defense caseLegal analysts said they don't expect the defense case to contain any new revelations about Tsarnaev.\"The crime is so horrific that they don't have much else really to point to, other than his age and the influence of his older brother,\" said Dan Collins, a former federal prosecutor who handled the case against a suspect in the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India.\"At this point, it's going to be the life experiences and the perspectives of the jurors in deciding whether or not they believe that these points are strong enough that his life should be spared,\" Collins said.Meg Penrose, a death penalty expert and professor at Texas A&M University School of Law, said it will be difficult for the jury to overcome the image of Tsarnaev planting a bomb just behind a group of children, including 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was killed.\"In a crime of this magnitude, what American citizen wouldn't ask, 'What would drive a person to do this?' And, as a juror, the question becomes, what answer would satisfy you?\" she said.Massachusetts has not executed anyone since 1947.The city's mayor, Marty Walsh, said he was glad to see the trial moving toward a conclusion.\"I am thankful that this phase of the trial has come to an end and am hopeful for a swift sentencing process,\" Walsh said. \"I hope [Wednesday\u2019s] verdict provides a small amount of closure for the survivors, families, and all impacted by the violent and tragic events.\"Tsarnaev relativeMeanwhile, in Russia, a relative of the brothers said she remains \"completely convinced that they were not guilty of this.\"\"These boys didn't need this,\" Rosa Tsarnaeva, a 66-year-old cousin of Tsarnaev's father, told The Associated Press. \"They never saw war, they were little when they arrived in the U.S. and grew up there.\"No one in the Tsarnaev family, none of the relatives, ever took part in the military campaigns in Chechnya\" in which separatists, some of them radical Islamists, fought two wars against Russian troops, she said.The brothers' father, who also lives in Russia, has not answered repeated phone calls or responded to text messages seeking his comment.Some material for this report came from AP and Reuters.Watch a related video report by VOA's Zlatica Hoke:Video sizewidthxheightpixelsBoston Jury to Mull Life or Death for TsarnaevShare this video0:03:18\u25b60:00:00/0:03:18\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 6.0MB360p | 8.5MB486p | 70.7MB/*<![CDATA[*/initInfographics({groups:[],params:[{\"Name\":\"embed_code\",\"Value\":\"\\u0026lt;div class=\\\"storify\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;iframe src=\\\"//storify.com/voa_news/boston-bomber-convicted-on-all-counts/embed?border=false\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"750\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" allowtransparency=\\\"true\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/iframe\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;script src=\\\"//storify.com/voa_news/boston-bomber-convicted-on-all-counts.js?border=false\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;noscript\\u0026gt;[\\u0026lt;a href=\\\"//storify.com/voa_news/boston-bomber-convicted-on-all-counts\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u0026gt;View the story \\\"Boston Bomber Convicted on All Counts\\\" on Storify\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;]\\u0026lt;/noscript\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;\",\"DefaultValue\":\"\",\"HtmlEncode\":false,\"Type\":\"String\"}],isMobile:true});Error rendering storify.(function(d){var userInput = Infographics.Param[\"embed_code\"],notRenderedS = d.querySelectorAll(\".storifySnippet:not(.storifySnippetRendered)\"),render = function() {try {var oEval = d.createElement(\"div\");oEval.innerHTML = userInput;} catch(e) {var snippets = d.getElementsByClassName(\"storifySnippet\");var lastSnippet = snippets[snippets.length -

On the afternoon of November 21, with emotions running high, all police leave was cancelled and an extra 1,300 officers were drafted in to guard his coffin as it was driven to Coventry airport and flown to Ireland.But hours after the funeral procession, two bombs exploded in two packed Birmingham city centre pubs.It has been claimed that a 'link man' ordered the revenge attacks in an impulsive grief-stricken reaction to McDade's death - without the blessing of IRA chiefs in Belfast. The secret figure, whose identity has never been revealed, is believed to have then left for Ireland to attend the funeral and has remained there ever since.Another theory is that the bombings were revenge attacks for the Loyalist Dublin and Monaghan bombings six months earlier.Thirty four people died in the Ulster Volunteer Force attacks, labelled the worst atrocity of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It has been claimed the British security forces colluded with the loyalist terrorists in the bombings.Mick Murray was one of three men arrested along with the Birmingham Six by West Midlands Police in the immediate aftermath of the pub blasts.It has been claimed that Murray, who died in 1999, helped choose the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town as targets.And he was named as being one of the bomb-makers who transported the explosives to the city centre before handing them to the men who planted them.But, it is claimed Murray then botched a telephone warning made to our sister newspaper The Birmingham Post. It was supposed to give half an hour for the pubs to be cleared. But his warning, using the codeword Double X, came just six minutes before the first explosion - and did not name either pub.Murray admitted being a member of the IRA after his arrest. But West Midlands Police never charged him with murder and he served 12 years in jail for conspiracy to cause explosions.In 1990 his name was mentioned in a report handed to the Government by the Who Bombed Birmingham? Granada TV programme.The show was based on a book by campaigning MP, Chris Mullin, who said he met the real bombers, but could not reveal their identity.In another Parliamentary report, the MP stated the programme-makers had also passed a Special Branch document containing details of interviews with an IRAman to the Home Office. The unnamed terrorist had been arrested in November 1975 - six months after the trial and conviction of the Birmingham Six.Mr Mullin claimed the terrorist gave police accurate information including the names of some of those whom he said were responsible for the bombs.Crucially, the papers contained the remark: 'So-and-so told me he put one of the bombs in the pub.'AlongwithMurrayand the Birmingham Six two other men - including James Kelly - were arrested in the immediate aftermath of the carnage.Kelly was found guilty of possessing explosives and bizarrely claimed he was a spy who infiltrated the IRA so he could later give help to the police.The Birmingham Six were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1975 for the pub bombings. They were all Belfast born but had lived in Brum since the 1960s.Five of them had left the city on the early evening of November 21 from New Street Station - hours before the explosions - to travel to Belfast to attend McDade's funeral. They were seen off by Callaghan.The five were arrested at Heysham that evening and Callaghan was taken into custody the next day.All the men were interrogated by Birmingham CID and claimed at trial they were beaten, threatened and forced to sign statements written by the police over three days of questioning.Their convictions were overturned by the Court of Appeal in March1991and their case is seen as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British legal history.Terrorist activity was rife in the Midlands during the 1970sand police arrested scores of IRA members in the months following the bombings.But the IRA unit which gained particular notoriety was the Birmingham Nine. They were responsible for 20 of the 31 bomb blasts in Birmingham and parts of the West Midlands between August 1973 and August 1974.Patrick Guilfoyle, Martin Coughlan, Gerard Young, Joseph Duffy, Michael Murray, Anthony Madigan, Joseph Ashe, Gerald Small and Stephen Blake conducted the biggest wave of bombings in the region since the Second World War.Coughlan and Young were said to be the leading figures in the campaign.Coughlan was born in Dublin and came to Birmingham in 1956. He rented a house in Chelmsley Wood with his wife and had three children.It is believed he was the brains behind the campaign of terror which began in Birmingham and spread to Manchester.Guilfoyle never quite made the grade of bomber. He caused an explosion that badly injured one of his IRA colleagues because he was smoking a cigarette while making a bomb.Northern Ireland historian David McVea said: 'Many different theories have been put forward as to who actually carried out the bombings, but it is unlikely that the true culprits will ever be identified.'The IRA was very protective of its members at the time, people moved in and out of the different cells constantly. 'As well as the killing of so many innocent people the real tragedy is the wrongful jailing of the Birmingham Six.'The IRA was able to use the injustice against these men to their advantage for years.'CAPTION(S):SLAUGHTERED: victims are taken away from the pub bombings; DEVASTATED: wreckage outside the Tavern in the Town; DEAD: James McDade; TRIBUTE: memorial to the victims", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Attacker Mick Murray <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target two pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham city <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain jailed <extra_id_0> Detainee The nine men <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant Birmingham Nine <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham city <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict served <extra_id_0> Prosecutor West Midlands Police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee terrorist <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict conviction <extra_id_0> Defendant Birmingham Six <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee James Kelly <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentenced <extra_id_0> Defendant Birmingham Six <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime interrogated <extra_id_0> Defendant men <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Investigator Birmingham CID <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Attacker Patrick Guilfoyle <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place region <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "A report by the United Nations Human Rights Council has called for independent investigations to be carried out into drone attacks after a series of strikes that result in unexpected civilian deaths in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere. Most of the attacks involved US drones.In a 21-page report, the UN special rapporteur on human rights, Ben Emmerson, records a dramatic reduction in drone strikes in 2013 in Pakistan but increases in Afghanistan and, towards the end of the year, in Yemen.The decline in drone strikes in Pakistan comes after its government's repeated calls for the US to reduce their number. Islamabad argued that the impact of drone strikes was counterproductive, turned opinion in the country against the US and undermined the Pakistani government.But Emmerson noted a threefold increase in recorded civilian casualties from drone strikes in Afghanistan in 2013. He concluded that states have an obligation to launch inquiries into cases in which civilians become caught up.His report said: \"Having regard to the duty of states to protect civilians in armed conflict, the special rapporteur concluded that in any case in which there have been, or appear to have been, civilian casualties that were not anticipated when the attack was planned, the state responsible is under an obligation to conduct a prompt, independent and impartial fact-finding inquiry and to provide a detailed public explanation of the results.\"This obligation would be triggered whenever there is a plausible indication from any apparently reliable source that unintended civilian casualties may have been sustained.\"The proposal is likely to form the basis for a draft resolution to be debated by the UNHRC in Geneva, Switzerland.Emmerson devoted a large part of the report to listing specific drone strikes involving civilians. He said he had identified 30 attacks out of a total of 37 brought to his attention in which civilians had been killed, suffered life-threatening injuries or been put at risk.In Afghanistan, Emmerson, who travelled widely for the report, said that up to the end of 2012 drone strikes \"appeared to have inflicted significantly lower levels of civilians casualties than aerial attacks carried out by other air platforms. This is no longer the position.\"In 2013, drone attacks accounted for 40% of the total number of civilian fatalities from air strikes. There were 45 civilian fatalities and 14 non-fatal injuries, a threefold increase compared with 2012.In Pakistan, he recorded \"a marked drop\" in civilian casualties since 2012. \"Figures to the end of 2013 confirm that there has been a significant de-escalation in the number of recorded drone strikes in Pakistan,\" he said. Strikes were down to 27 in 2013 from a peak of 128 in 2010, and for the first time in nine years there had been no civilian casualties reported.\"At the time of writing, there have been no reported drone strikes during 2014, the longest pause since President Obama took office,\" Emmerson said.The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which monitors media reports on drones strikes, reported last month that there had been no known drone strikes in Pakistan since 25 December. US officials say the lull was a response to requests by the Pakistani government, which has been trying to launch peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban.In Yemen, Emmerson was told that the US routinely sought prior consent for attacks, although Human Rights Watch has quoted the Yemeni government as saying they were not pre-approved.In Israel, he said the government stressed it aimed for zero civilian casualties, saying it provided advance warning of attacks where possible. But Emmerson \"identified a number of sample strikes in which there are credible allegations that civilians were killed or injured as the result of Israeli drone strikes in Gaza\".Kat Craig, legal director of Reprieve, the legal charity which has been campaigning on the issue, said: \"In Yemen, Pakistan and elsewhere, the US, assisted by its European allies, is carrying out devastating attacks with total impunity \u2013 a practice that is terrorising local communities, and creating far more extremism than it has ever eliminated.\"It is high time that the US provided full accountability and transparency around its use of drones, and investigated civilian casualties. This report will only increase pressure on the US to bring their covert programme out of the shadows.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigations <extra_id_0> Investigator United Nations Human Rights Council <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strikes <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place elsewhere <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact talks <extra_id_0> Participant government <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Pakistani <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigated <extra_id_0> Defendant US <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strikes <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Gaza <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Israeli <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "2 New Arrests in London Terror AttackLondon police said Friday they have made two more arrests in connection with the attack near Parliament.Counter-terrorism commander Mark Rowley characterized the arrests as \u201csignificant,\u201d though he did not provide any details. He said nine people are currently in custody and one person has been released.Police officials identified the attacker who killed four people near Parliament as Khalid Masood, a Briton who converted to Islam and had a lengthy criminal record for weapons possession and other charges.Rowley said Masood\u2019s birth name was Adrian Russell Ajao and appealed to the public for any information about him.A woman holds up a sign at a vigil for the victims of Wednesday's attack, at Trafalgar Square in London, March 23, 2017. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for an attack by a man who plowed an SUV into pedestrians and then stabbed a police officer.\u201cWe remain keen to hear from anyone who knew Khalid Masood well, understands who his associates were and can provide us with information about places he has recently visited,\u2019\u2019 Rowley said. \u201cThere might be people out there who did have concerns about Masood but did not feel comfortable for whatever reason in passing those concerns to us.\u2019\u2019Islamic State said Masood, who was 52, was a \u201csoldier\u201d of the extremist group who responded to its call to attack civilians and the military in countries allied with the United States in battling IS.Masood had never been convicted of terrorist offenses, but British security officials said he had been investigated in the past \u201cin relation to concerns about violent extremism.\u201d Authorities say they believe he was acting alone Wednesday when he ran down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, a Thames River crossing leading to the Houses of Parliament, crashed his rented vehicle into a gate and fatally stabbed a policeman who tried to stop him.Armed police shot and killed Masood moments later.A property in Birmingham, England, was searched by police following Wednesday's London attack, March 23, 2017.In the hours after Wednesday\u2019s attack in the heart of London, police conducted raids around the country in search of anyone who may have given support to Masood. Eight men and women were arrested Thursday on suspicion of planning terrorist acts.The dead assailant, who was older than most Islamist attackers involved in recent spectacular terror attacks in Europe, had been a teacher of English and was known as a fanatical bodybuilder.One of the civilians who was run down on the bridge, a 75-year-old man, died Thursday in a hospital, raising the casualty toll to four victims and Masood.Although Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, a statement posted online did not implicate the group in the planning or execution of the attack.An Italian tourist who witnessed the carnage told reporters he saw Masood attack the policeman with two knives. \u201cHe gave [the officer] around 10 stabs in the back,\u201d the visitor said.Valiant efforts to resuscitate Constable Keith Palmer at the scene failed. The 48-year-old officer was a 15-year police veteran.One American was among the dead - 54-year-old Kurt Cochran of Utah, who was in London with his wife to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. His wife, Melissa, was among the 30 people injured.

{"text": "And just like that, Boston\u2019s mind-boggling week of murder and mayhem was over.A law enforcement ensemble from what looked like every jurisdiction in copdom caught the last terrorist punk Friday night.Nineteen-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, bloodied and dazed from a shootout, was found cowering in a Watertown resident\u2019s backyard boat, out of bombs, bullets and bravado.\u201cYES!\u201d I yelled at the TV, and I know I wasn\u2019t the only one.Now come the questions \u2026Why didn\u2019t any of this kid\u2019s family members or classmates see this coming?Was Dzhokhar\u2019s older brother, Tamerlan, who was killed in a shootout with police the night before, the radical mastermind who orchestrated the Boston Marathon bombings and turned his younger brother to the Dark Side?Will Boston ever be the same?Then another thought came to mind that was closer to home.Three years ago, Spokane had its own brush with a backpack bomb and human evil.A novel I read recently spoke of how life and death are sometimes separated by the thinnest of circumstances. That was certainly the case here on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 17, 2011.I shudder to think how different things would have been for us were it not for three temporary workers who were pulling a shift for the city\u2019s Public Utilities District: Mark Steiner, Brandon Klaus and Sherman Welpton.Ring a bell? Didn\u2019t with me, either.I\u2019m embarrassed to say that I had to do a computer search to get the names of the trio that arguably saved Spokane from a Boston-like carnage.The men noticed the backpack. It had been placed along the route soon to be filled with marchers honoring the late civil rights leader. They could have just as easily ignored it, but they didn\u2019t. They opened the package, saw wires and called authorities.Eric Olsen and Jason Hartman, two police sergeants, smoothly ordered the march diverted.It took some time, but the clues led investigators to the cancer behind this mad act: Kevin W. Harpham, a 36-year-old self-avowed white supremacist from rural Addy, Wash.Racist. Islamic fanatics \u2026 A terrorist by any other name still stinks the same.In federal court, Harpham made a ludicrous and failed attempt to dismiss his unexploded handiwork as a \u201ccreative\u201d protest against the so-called evils of multiculturalism.Those in the know say Harpham\u2019s bomb was beyond diabolical. Laced with rat poison, the weapon was designed to be detonated from as far as 1,000 feet away. Dozens could have died or been mutilated horribly.Harpham was sentenced to 32 years in prison, the maximum allowed under a plea bargain struck between Harpham\u2019s attorneys and prosecutors.That still doesn\u2019t seem like enough.It\u2019s easy to take for granted the things that don\u2019t happen, but watching the horrors unfold in Boston should drive home just how lucky we were.Limbs blown off. Lives lost. In an eye blink, one of the nation\u2019s most revered athletic events had turned into a bloody war zone.Then things got even more surreal.Carjacking. Kidnapping. A police officer killed. Citizens told to stay in their homes.Before last Monday, would anyone have imagined that two angry young men could paralyze a city such as Boston?And who would imagine that Spokane would be spared by the grace of God and a few contract workers?It\u2019s true.

{"text": "HOUSTON \u2013 A 25-year-old man has been taken into custody for attempting to maliciously damage or destroy property receiving federal financial assistance, announced Acting U.S. Attorney Abe Martinez.A criminal complaint was filed in Houston federal court today charging Andrew Schneck, of Houston. He made his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Mary Milloy this morning, at which time he was temporarily ordered into custody upon the government\u2019s request pending a detention hearing set for Thursday, Aug. 24 at 2:00 p.m.According to the complaint, on the evening of Aug. 19, 2017, a Houston park ranger observed Schneck kneeling among the bushes in front of the General Dowling Monument located in Hermann Park in Houston. Schneck was allegedly holding two small boxes with various items inside to include what appeared to be duct tape and wires. After placing the boxes on the ground per the ranger\u2019s request, Schneck then allegedly took a drink from plastic bottle but immediately spit it on the ground. The ranger then noticed a timer and wires in the box and notified the Houston Police Department (HPD), according to the complaint.The clear liquid was field tested as was a white powdery substance found in a small, black aluminum tube which revealed they were most likely nitroglycerin and Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), respectively, according to the charges. HMTD is a high explosive organic compound used as an initiating, or primary explosive. Nitroglycerin has been used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of explosives. ln its pure form, nitroglycerin is a contact explosive, with physical shock causing it to explode, which degrades over time to even more unstable forms. Nitroglycerin is highly dangerous to transport or use. ln its undiluted form, it is one of the world's most powerful explosives.Authorities believe the items in Schneck\u2019s possession on Aug. 19 were capable to produce a viable explosive device, according to the charges.The complaint further alleges that Schneck conducts \u201cchemistry experiments\u201d at his Houston residence.The City of Houston receives federal financial assistance for maintenance of Hermann Park where the General Dowling Monument is located.If convicted, Schneck faces a minimum of five and up to 40 years in federal prison and a possible $250,000 maximum fine.The FBI and HPD are conducting the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorneys S. Mark McIntyre and Ted Imperato are prosecuting the case.A criminal complaint is a formal accusation of criminal conduct, not evidence.A defendant is presumed innocent unless convicted through due process of law.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain custody <extra_id_0> Detainee 25-year-old man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place HOUSTON <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain custody <extra_id_0> Jailer Mary Milloy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charging <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant Andrew Schneck <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Houston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict prosecuting <extra_id_0> Prosecutor S.

{"text": "Manchester Bomber Was Part of Network, British Police SayBritish police said Wednesday it was \u201cclear\u201d the suicide bomber who attacked a concert in Manchester did not act alone.\"It's very clear that this is a network that we are investigating,\" Manchester Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said during a news conference.Hopkins said police had four people in custody, so far, as police conduct armed raids throughout Manchester, though he would not confirm whether police found the alleged bomb maker.A statement Wednesday from Greater Manchester Police said only that the arrests came after officers executed warrants in South Manchester. There was no information about how the four men might be involved in the attack.British interior minister Amber Rudd said Wednesday the suicide bomber, who has been identified as Salman Abedi, 22, was \"known\" by British intelligence services before the bombing.She also told the BBC that \"it seems likely, possible, that he wasn't doing this on his own.\"The blast at the conclusion of a concert by American pop star Ariana Grande at Manchester Arena killed 22 people and wounded 59 others. The attacker also died at the site.Police officers arrive at a residential property on Elsmore Road in Fallowfield, Manchester, on May 24, 2017, as investigations continue into the May 22 terror attack at the Manchester Arena.Investigation shifts to Abedi's activitiesInvestigators are now trying to figure out what Abedi was up to in his last days before the attack Monday.French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told BFM television on Wednesday that British and French intelligence have information that Abedi had likely traveled to Syria.According to Collomb, Abedi \u201cgrew up in Britain and then suddenly, after a trip to Libya and then likely to Syria, became radicalized and decided to carry out this attack.\u201d\"In any case, the links with Daesh (Islamic State) are proven,\" he said.Islamic State is claiming it was behind the attack, but neither British nor U.S. intelligence have confirmed that.Police officers stand guard in central Manchester, Britain, May 24, 2017 after Monday's suicide attack at an Ariana Grande concert.Terror level raised Britain raised its terrorism alert level to critical \u2013 the highest step \u2013 after the blast, signaling that another attack was highly likely and could be imminent.The change is most visible in the deployment of soldiers to help guard certain areas, including major events such as concerts and football matches, in order to free up police officers.Hopkins said an off-duty police officer was among those killed in the suicide attack, but it will take up to five days for authorities to identify all the victims.\u201cDue to number of victims the Home Office post-mortems are likely to take four to five days. After this we will be in a position to formerly name the victims,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have spoken to all of the families of those who lay injured in our hospitals.\u201dBritish Prime Minister Theresa May said in an address to the nation late Tuesday that authorities will do everything possible to protect the public and asked people to remain vigilant.\"I do not want the public to feel unduly alarmed. We have faced a serious terrorist threat in our country for many years,\" May said.People attend a vigil in Albert Square, Manchester, England, May 23, 2017, the day after the suicide attack at an Ariana Grande concert that left 22 people dead as it ended on Monday night.Maximum carnage Earlier in the day, she spoke more directly about the attack itself, saying the bomber chose the \"time and place to cause maximum carnage and to kill and injure indiscriminately.\"Many of the victims were young girls, with the youngest identified so far being just 8-year-old.Video from the arena showed the joy in the audience at the end of the concert turning to confusion and then to panic and a scramble to get out of the building as the realization of what just happened spread.Witness say they saw blood covered bodies on the floor while others, badly wounded, staggered toward the exits of the building.The scene outside the concert hall was also chaotic, with traffic snarled and parents rushing to the scene.Britain's Queen Elizabeth held a moment of silence at a garden party at Buckingham Palace.

The future will not be found in denying collective failures and mistakes or closing minds and hearts to the plight of those who have been hurt. That includes all of the victims of the conflict, combatants and non-combatants. It will not be achieved by creating a hierarchy of victims in which some are deemed more or less worthy than others. The process of conflict resolution requires the equal acknowledgement of the grief and loss of others. On this anniversary, we are endeavouring to fulfil this responsibility to those we have hurt. The IRA is committed unequivocally to the search for freedom, justice and peace in Ireland. We remain totally committed to the peace process and to dealing with the challenges and difficulties which this presents. This includes the acceptance of past mistakes and of the hurt and pain we have caused to others.\" P O'Neill, Irish Republican Publicity Bureau, Dublin.The statement from the IRA was received by An Phoblacht (Republican News) on Tuesday, 16 July:", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim many <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injure <extra_id_0> Victim non-combatants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Victim non-combatants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths <extra_id_0> Victim non-combatants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Victim non-combatants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure hurt <extra_id_0> Victim those <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack conflict  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack conflict  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure hurt <extra_id_0> Injurer we <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim those <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact statement <extra_id_0> Participant An Phoblacht <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Report says CIA attacks led to civilian deaths and casualties and says US protocols are 'hurdle to transparency'A United Nations investigation has so far identified 33 drone strikes around the world that have resulted in civilian casualties and may have violated international humanitarian law.The report by the UN's special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, Ben Emmerson QC, calls on the US to declassify information about operations co-ordinated by the CIA and clarify its positon on the legality of unmanned aerial attacks.Published ahead of a debate on the use of remotely piloted aircraft, at the UN general assembly in New York next Friday, the 22-page document examines incidents in Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Pakistan and Gaza.It has been published to coincide with a related report released earlier on Thursday by Professor Christof Heyns, the UN's special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, which warned that the technology was being misused as a form of \"global policing\".Emmerson, who travelled to Islamabad for his investigation, said the Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs has records of as many as 330 drone strikes in the country's north-western tribal areas since 2004. Up to 2,200 people have been killed \u2013 of whom at least 400 were civilians \u2013 according to the Pakistan government.In Yemen, Emmerson's report says that as many as 58 civilians are thought to have been killed in attacks by UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). \"While the fact that civilians have been killed or injured does not necessarily point to a violation of international humanitarian law, it undoubtedly raises issues of accountability and transparency,\" the study notes.Reaper UAVs, used by the RAF in Afghanistan, have a range of 3,700 miles (5,900 km), a maximum airspeed of 250 knots and can ascend to 15,300 metres (50,000 feet), the document explains. Their missions can last up to 18 hours.The Reaper carries three cameras as well as laser-guided bombs. Three communication networks relay information between the RAF ground station in the UK and the UAV: \"a secure internet-based chat function, a secure radio routed via satellite and a secure telephone system\".\"The United Kingdom has reported only one civilian casualty incident, in which four civilians were killed and two civilians injured in a remotely piloted aircraft strike by the Royal Air Force in Afghanistan on 25 March 2011,\" Emmerson's report states. An RAF inquiry found that \"the actions of the [ground] crew had been in accordance with the applicable rules of engagement\".The special rapporteur said that he was informed that during RAF operations in Afghanistan, targeting intelligence is \"thoroughly scrubbed\" to ensure accuracy before authorisation to proceed is given. RAF strikes, he points out, are accountable in the UK through the Ministry of Defence and parliament.By contrast, Emmerson criticises the CIA's involvement in US drone strikes for creating \"an almost insurmountable obstacle to transparency\". He adds: \"One consequence is that the United States has to date failed to reveal its own data on the level of civilian casualties inflicted through the use of remotely piloted aircraft in classified operations conducted in Pakistan and elsewhere.\"Recent prounouncments from Barack Obama, however, have stressed that \"before any strike is taken, there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured\".Emmerson acknowledges that: \"If used in strict compliance with the principles of international humanitarian law, remotely piloted aircraft are capable of reducing the risk of civilian casualties in armed conflict by significantly improving the situational awareness of military commanders.\" But, he cautions, there is \"no clear international consensus\" on the laws controlling the deployment of drone strikes.The special rapporteur concludes by urging: \"the United States to further clarify its position on the legal and factual issues \u2026 to declassify, to the maximum extent possible, information relevant to its lethal extraterritorial counter-terrorism operations; and to release its own data on the level of civilian casualties inflicted through the use of remotely piloted aircraft, together with information on the evaluation methodology used.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker CIA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target civilian <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths <extra_id_0> Victim civilian <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer CIA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strikes <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place country <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injurer Royal Air Force <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument aircraft <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strike <extra_id_0> Instrument aircraft <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Afghanistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Royal Air Force <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

Moscow also issued a similar warning to the FBI on Tamerlan Tsarnaev earlier in 2011. Officials say the agency launched an investigation, but eventually concluded he posed no threat.Information sharing U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns about information sharing between law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the aftermath of the April 15 twin bombings that left three people dead and 264 others injured - including at least 14 who lost limbs. Authorities will brief the full U.S. Senate on the investigation into the bombing.Investigators say Tamerlan, 26, and his brother Dzhokar, 19, placed the bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police last Thursday, while Dzhokhar was captured a day later.Dzhokhar has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction. He is in federal custody in a Boston hospital.Russia visit Several months after he first came to the attention of U.S. federal agents, Tamerlan Tsarnaev left the U.S. in January 2012 for a six-month visit to Russia. When he returned, his name generated an alert by a screening system used by U.S. Customs agents. But Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said the FBI told him it was not aware at the time of Tsarnaev's trip to Russia.U.S. investigators have questioned the suspects' parents in the Russian republic of Dagestan to determine if Tamerlan had contacts with Islamic extremists during his 2012 visit. The family is originally from Chechnya, where Muslim insurgents have been engaged in a bloody conflict with Russia for decades. Memorial service U.S. Vice President Joe Biden denounced the suspects Wednesday in Boston. Biden spoke at a memorial service for a university police officer allegedly gunned down by the suspects just days after the bombings. \"Why, whether it\u2019s al-Qaida central ... or two twisted, perverted, cowardly, knock-off jihadists here in Boston. Why do they do what they do?\u201d he asked.Several thousand mourners gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to remember the slain policeman, Sean Collier.

Flackes and Elliott (1994) Northern Ireland: A Political Directory 1968-1993 Many watching the television news reports were reduced to tears by horrifying pictures of firemen and rescue workers ... scraping up the remains of human beings into plastic bags ... Bardon (1992) A History of Ulster 'Bloody Friday' is the name given to the events that occurred in Belfast on Friday 21 July 1972. During the afternoon of 'Bloody Friday' the Irish Republican Army (IRA) planted and exploded 22 bombs which, in the space of 75 minutes, killed 9 people and seriously injured approximately 130 others. In addition to the bombs there were numerous hoax warnings about other explosive devices which added to the chaos in the streets that afternoon. Many people believe these hoax warnings were deliberately used to reduce the effectiveness of the security forces in dealing with the real bombs. As the quotes above make clear, the killing and maiming had a profound impact on most people in Northern Ireland. 'Bloody Friday' also led to the decision by the British Government to implement 'Operation Motorman' when, in the biggest British military operation since the 1956 Suez crisis, the British Army entered and ended the 'no-go' areas of Belfast and Derry.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> Instrument bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Irish Republican Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
