{"text": "An IRA member who was part of the group behind the Birmingham pub bombings has apologised.Michael Christopher Hayes \u2013 a self-confessed bomb maker \u2013 said he was sorry for the killing of innocent people in the 1974 blasts.Speaking to the BBC, Mr Hayes said he hoped his apology on behalf of all active republicans will help grieving relatives find \"closure\".He said: \"My apologies and my heartfelt sympathies to all of you, for the terrible, tragic loss that you've been put through. And all these years you've been trying to find closure. I hope at last God will be merciful and bring you closure.\"And I apologise not only for myself ... I apologise for all active republicans who had no intention of hurting anybody and sympathise with you.\"An eight-minute delay before police were warned of the bombs' location led to the death of 21 people and the injury of 182 others, when they exploded in a pair of city centre pubs. Mr Hayes said the bombs had not been intended to kill people.On the evening of the 21 November 1974, a man with an Irish accent called the Birmingham Post and Evening Mail newspapers to say two bombs were planted in the town centre.He finished the call by giving the official code used by the Provisional IRA to authenticate a warning call and allow civilians to be evacuated.Former IRA officials have since said there was an unintentional delay in issuing the warning.Mr Hayes said the IRA unit in Birmingham had been shocked by the death toll.\"That wasn't meant. It wouldn't have been done if that was the case,\" he said.The wreckage left at the Mulberry Bush pub in Birmingham after a bomb exploded on 21 November 1974 (PA)The Birmingham pub bombings caused the worst single losses of life in the Troubles. Six men were wrongfully convicted for the blasts but no-one has ever been brought to justice.Mr Hayes, 69, who now lives in south Dublin, said he personally defused a third bomb on Birmingham's Hagley Road after he became aware of the death toll in the first two blasts.He refused to say who planted the bombs in the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town but he said he wanted to speak out to give \"the point of view of a participant\".But relatives of those who were killed said the apology was \"gutless and spineless\".Mr Hayes' apology came as an inquest into the bombings was reopened by a coroner stating \"a wealth of evidence\" had not yet been heard.West Midland Police said their investigation remained open but that no further comments on the suspects' identities will be provided until the proceedings have concluded.Victims' families have repeatedly asked for the names of the suspects to be disclosed.Mr Hayes was arrested and questioned by West Midlands Police about the bombings in 1974 but he was released.He said he had been a member of the IRA for more than 30 years in both Ireland and England and had participated in the group's activities in Birmingham as \"an active volunteer\".UK news in pictures Show all 50 1 /50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 18 September 2020 A model presents a creation during the Bora Aksu catwalk show at London Fashion Week 2020 Reuters UK news in pictures 17 September 2020 World kickboxing champion Carl Thomas during his attempt to run a marathon while pulling a plane at Elvington Airfield near York.

{"text": "Roadside IED kills Russian major general in SyriaThe desert south and east of Deir ez-Zor on the regime\u2019s side of the Euphrates is rife with insurgentsRussia\u2019s foray into Syria took yet another heavy toll this week, when that nation\u2019s Defense Ministry confirmed that a major general was killed in Syria by an improvised explosive device, Al-Monitor online reported.Major General Vyacheslav Gladkikh died after a roadside IED detonated under a convoy of Russian soldiers and Syrian pro-regime militiamen near the city of Deir ez-Zor.Three other Russian military personnel were wounded, Russia\u2019s state-run Tass news agency reported.A local commander of Syria\u2019s National Defense Forces, a pro-Assad militia, was also reportedly killed.\u201cThey\u2019ve changed their tactics there,\u201d said one source, who declined to be named for security reasons.\u201cThey do nighttime infiltrations, lay mines and booby traps.\u201dVideo purporting to show the explosion circulated on social media this week.It was the first reported death of a Russian general in Syria since 2017, when a lieutenant general was killed in the same province, reportedly by mortar fire from the Islamic State, Al-Monitor reported.Deir ez-Zor and nearly all of Syrian territory west of the Euphrates River lie in Syrian government hands, with the major exception of Idlib province, the last rebel enclave in the country\u2019s nearly decadelong civil war.US-backed and Kurdish-led militias captured IS\u2019 last remaining territory in March 2019, but the desert countryside south and east of Deir ez-Zor on the regime\u2019s side of the Euphrates is rife with insurgents who continue to ambush pro-Syrian regime forces, Al-Monitor reported.Syria\u2019s eastern Badia, or desert, remains the country\u2019s last significant hot spot of IS activity.In April, more than two dozen Syrian pro-regime fighters were killed in IS attacks in Badia al-Sukhnah and Badia al-Sham, prompting Russian airstrikes, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Killings of local tribal figures recently rocked the east side of the Euphrates in Deir ez-Zor, which is controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, Al-Monitor reported.It is not clear who carried out the slayings, though locals have alternatively blamed IS and the Assad regime.A US official told Al-Monitor last month that there could be anywhere from 2,000 to 10,000 IS insurgents in sleeper cells across Iraq and Syria.Coalition spokesman US Army Col. Myles Caggins III told Al-Monitor that the US recently provided Iraqi authorities with \u201cseveral million dollars\u2019 worth\u201d of border security infrastructure to interdict illicit smuggling in the border area.The Pentagon says US special forces at the isolated al-Tanf base in the Badia are there to keep pressure on IS in the border area, but rebels have told Al-Monitor that the proximity of Russian and Syrian forces on the roads outside the US-controlled zone make operations outside the area difficult.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die kills <extra_id_0> Victim general <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Syria <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim general <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Al-Monitor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Vyacheslav Gladkikh <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim personnel <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim commander <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim general <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place province <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Al-Monitor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer IS <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Al-Monitor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Al-Monitor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker IS <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Badia al-Sham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation smuggling  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact confirmed <extra_id_0> Communicator Defense Ministry <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Tass <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator source <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "CNN interviews man claiming to be Maduro assassination attempt organizerImage: CNNIn this frame from CNN footage aired on March 14, a DJI Matrice M600 Pro equipped with the A3 Pro positioning system (the white discs), apparently the same model used in the attack in Caracas last August.Cable News Network (CNN), the American news outlet, has published a report with video following an interview with a man claiming to be the organizer of the August 4 assassination attempt in Caracas on Venezuela\u2019s president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, using two drones.Seven people were injured in the two explosions.A number of arrests were made following the attack, but it is unclear if the suspects had anything to do with the incident.The man, whose identity was not revealed, provided CNN with cellphone footage said to be from a rented farm at a remote site in Columbia.The videos show men unboxing and assembling two D\u00e0-Ji\u0101ng Innovations (DJI) Matrice M600 Pro c-drones on a billiards table.Scenes purporting to show an explosive charge mounted underneath one of the drones and a DJI flight controller were partially blurred by CNN editors.Video footage said to be taken on the grounds of the farmhouse show two DJI Phantom quadcopter drones being flown simultaneously in what was described as practice piloting.CNN did not specify that the Phantom quadcopters shown in the practice runs differ from the larger M600 Pro hexacopters shown being prepared for the attack.The man interviewed claimed that following the assassination attempt, he met with US officials on three occasions to answer their questions and solicit assistance, which he said was not forthcoming.The footage shows clearly that both of the M600 Pro drones are equipped with DJI\u2019s A3 Pro positioning system, a set of three redundant GPS units and controllers meant to provide more precise and reliable positioning than the stock single A3 system delivered on the original M600 model.The C-Drone Review had identified such a three-sensor system on one of the M600 drones which exploded in August from analysis of Telemundo footage.Although CNN in their report said the drones used in the attack were \"small\", the M600 Pro model is an industrial-grade hexacopter c-drone with a payload of 13lb (6kg) and is larger than the Phantom models shown flying in the footage.Video from last August in Caracas shows that the landing struts of the M600 Pros had been removed, lightening the drones for their one-way trips.The M600 Pro folds to a smaller size than the original M600; CNN said in their report they were told that the drones used in the attack were dismantled, taken over the border from Columbia to Venezuela, and reassembled there.Contacted, DJI could not definitively confirm that some of its drones appear in the footage aired by CNN, although that appears to be the case.A spokesman for DJI, Adam Lisberg, sent the following statement to the C-Drone Review:DJI makes drones entirely for peaceful purposes, and we absolutely deplore any attempt to use our drones to cause harm.We build safety features into our products to help drone pilots avoid flying in restricted areas, and we developed our AeroScope system to allow authorities to remotely identify and track airborne drones.We have little ability to control what people do with our products after purchase, but anyone who deliberately misuses our products should expect to be held responsible for their actions.Venezuela is in crisis, with widespread shortages of staple foodstuffs and medical supplies, rolling power outages, and thousands of inhabitants leaving the country every day.President Maduro has accused Columbia and the United States of conspiring against him, without proof.The US withdrew its last embassy personnel from Venezuela last week, as opposition politician Juan Guaid\u00f3 seeks to oust Maduro from power.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Contact interviews <extra_id_0> Participant man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact aired <extra_id_0> Communicator CNN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble equipped <extra_id_0> Artifact Matrice M600 Pro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components A3 Pro positioning system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact published <extra_id_0> Communicator CNN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact interview <extra_id_0> Participant man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosions  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble assembling <extra_id_0> Components Matrice M600 Pro c-drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble mounted <extra_id_0> Artifact drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components explosive charge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle dismantled <extra_id_0> Artifact the drones used in the attack <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble reassembled <extra_id_0> Artifact the drones used in the attack <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact met <extra_id_0> Participant officials <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flown <extra_id_0> Vehicle Phantom quadcopter drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassination <extra_id_0> Attacker man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Nicol\u00e1s Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrests <extra_id_0> Detainee suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize identified <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject three-sensor system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Defendant Columbia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation withdrew <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact personnel <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize claimed <extra_id_0> Identifier The man interviewed <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Wealth of Clues Led to Quick Arrest of New York Suspected BomberNEW YORK \u2014\u00a0The man suspected of planting bombs in a New York neighborhood and a New Jersey seaside town may have aimed to inflict carnage incognito, but he didn't succeed for long in concealing his identity.Ahmad Khan Rahami provided investigators with a wealth of clues that led to his arrest about 50 hours after the first explosion, according to three law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation.His fingerprints and DNA were found at the scene of the Manhattan bombing, they said. His uncovered face was clearly captured by surveillance cameras near the spot of the blast.Electronic toll records show a car to which he had access was driven from New Jersey to Manhattan and back to New Jersey the day of the bombing, according to the officials, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss an ongoing case.Those and other clues spurred officials to publicize his name and photo Monday morning, asking for help finding Rahami, 28, a Muslim U.S. citizen born in Afghanistan, who lives with his family in Elizabeth, New Jersey.As the investigation heated up, a bar owner in Linden, New Jersey, reported someone asleep in his doorway. An officer went to investigate and recognized the man as Rahami, police and the mayor said.Rahami pulled a gun and shot the officer \u2014 who was wearing a bulletproof vest \u2014 in the torso, and more officers joined in a running gun battle along the street and brought Rahami down, police Capt. James Sarnicki said. Another police officer was grazed by a bullet.\"A lot of technology involved in this, but a lot of good, old-fashioned police work, too,\" said New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill. He said now, investigators would \"make sure that we get to the bottom of who's involved and why.\"After surgery for a gunshot wound to his leg, Rahami was being held on $5.2 million bail, charged with five counts of attempted murder of police officers. Federal prosecutors said they still were weighing charges over the bombings. Rahami remains hospitalized.Messages left for family members were not immediately returned. It wasn't clear when Rahami would get an attorney.Officials said they have no other suspects at large, but cautioned they are still investigating.The bombing spread fear across the New York area and revived anxiety about homegrown terrorism nationwide.As the East Coast was rattled by the bombings, a man who authorities say referred to Allah wounded nine people in a stabbing rampage at a Minnesota mall Saturday before being shot to death by an off-duty police officer. Authorities are investigating the stabbings as a possible terrorist attack but have not drawn any connection between the bloodshed there and the bombings.William Sweeney Jr., the FBI's assistant director in New York, said there was no indication so far that the bombings were the work of a larger terror cell.Rahami wasn't on any terror or no-fly watch lists, though he had been interviewed for immigration purposes traveling between the U.S. and Afghanistan, one of the law enforcement officials said.Rahami and his family live above their restaurant \u2014 called First American Fried Chicken \u2014 and the family has clashed with the city over closing times and noise complaints, which the Rahamis said in a lawsuit were tinged with anti-Muslim sentiment.The lawsuit was terminated in 2012 because one of Rahami's brothers had pleaded guilty to blocking police from enforcing closing hours at the restaurant.A childhood friend, Flee Jones, said Rahami had become more religious after returning from a trip to Afghanistan several years ago. Still, some of the family restaurant's customers said Rahami was more likely to talk about his interest in cars than to mention faith.\"He's a very friendly guy,\" patron Ryan McCann said. \"That's what's so scary.\"The investigation began when a pipe bomb blew up Saturday morning in Seaside Park, New Jersey, before a charity race to benefit Marines. No one was injured.Then a shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bomb exploded Saturday night in New York's Chelsea section, wounding 29 people, none seriously. An unexploded pressure-cooker bomb was found blocks away.Late Sunday night, five explosive devices were discovered in a trash can at an Elizabeth train station, about 3 miles from where Rahami was later found asleep in the doorway of a bar.Investigators are still gathering evidence and have not publicly tied Rahami to those devices, though Sweeney noted they aren't \"ruling anything out.\"The bombs discovered Saturday all used flip cellphones as a trigger and were all made with easily purchasable materials, a federal law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said.After zeroing in on Rahami and learning of the car that had traveled between New Jersey and New York, authorities pulled it over Sunday night after it headed in the direction of Kennedy airport. The law enforcement officials said at least one of Rahami's relatives was in the car.All five were questioned and released, Sweeney said.

{"text": "On 27 August 1975 a Provisional IRA bomb exploded without warning at the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey, England. There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured, some severely. Two off-duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing.==Background==In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven \"incident centres\" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit (ASU) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang (due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974.==The bombing==The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9:20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off-duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign (Phase Two) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people.==Aftermath==One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a \"carbon copy\" of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences. The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street. The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which, along with the bombings, caused the deaths of nearly 20 people, injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property.==See also==*Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1970\u201379)== References ==", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Caterham Arms public house <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caterham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Instrument bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place England <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> Attacker IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Oxford Street <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Injurer people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle blew <extra_id_0> Artifact roof <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place pub <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer unit <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim hundreds <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injurer unit <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle damage <extra_id_0> Artifact property <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Damager unit <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure lost <extra_id_0> Victim soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassination <extra_id_0> Target Edward Heath <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Their <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack threw <extra_id_0> Attacker attackers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice a bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place bedroom <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Victim Some <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure losing <extra_id_0> Victim soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble planted <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler Balcombe Street Gang <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place house <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection monitor <extra_id_0> Observer centres <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble placed <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Research charge <extra_id_0> Researcher officers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentences <extra_id_0> Defendant people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain caught <extra_id_0> Detainee they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Balcombe Street <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact agreed <extra_id_0> Participant Northern Ireland Office <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuela's chief prosecutor's office is reporting three deaths on the day of a controversial vote for a constituent assembly that opposition leaders fear will trigger the end of democracy in Venezuela.The office tweeted that 28-year-old Angelo Mendez and 39-year-old Eduardo Olave were killed at a protest Sunday in Merida. Thirty-year-old Ricardo Campos was killed in a separate incident in Sucre.Few details were provided on the deaths.Leaders with the opposition Democratic Action party on Twitter identified Campos as the group's youth secretary in Sucre, a state in northern Venezuela east of the nation's capital.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxThe deaths bring the total to at least 122 killed in nearly four months of political upheaval.Demonstrators watch a barricade burn after clashes broke out while the Constituent Assembly election is being carried out in Caracas, Venezuela, on Sun., July 30, 2017. ReutersMeanwhile, Venezuelans appeared to be abstaining in massive numbers on Sunday in a show of silent protest against a vote to select a constitutional assembly giving the government virtually unlimited powers.Associated Press journalists toured more than two dozen polling places in neighborhoods across the capital, including many traditional strongholds of the ruling socialist party in southern and western Caracas. Virtually all the polling places saw hours-long lines of thousands of people in past elections over the last two decades of socialist government.One site, a sports and cultural complex known as the Poliedro, had several thousand people waiting about two hours to vote, many having traveled from opposition-dominated neighborhoods where polling places were closed. Of the dozens of others sites seen by the AP, two in the loyalist-heavy neighborhood of El Valle had lines of approximately 200 to 400 people. All the others had at most a couple of dozen voters, and many had less than a half-dozen or were completely empty.Opinion polls say more than 70 percent of the country is opposed to Sunday's vote.\"People aren't in agreement with this,\" said Daniel Ponza, a 33-year-old drywall contractor, as he watched a few dozen people outside a polling place in El Valle. \"People are dying of hunger, looking for food in the trash. And I think this is just going to make things worse.\"Sunday evening, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations sent a message on Twitter calling the Venezuela election a \"sham\" and \"step toward dictatorship\":Maduro\u2019s sham election is another step toward dictatorship.

At least three police were wounded when one of their motorcycles detonated in a powerful explosion. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear.After voting at dawn, President Nicolas Maduro called for international acceptance of what he called his government's fight against a violent opposition trying to sabotage his administration.Motorcycles burn after clashes broke out while the Constituent Assembly election was being carried out in Caracas, Venezuela, on Sun., July 30, 2017. ReutersThe run-up to the vote has been marked by months of clashes between protesters and the government that have left at least 116 dead and nearly 2,000 wounded. A 61-year-old nurse was fatally shot by men accused of being pro-government paramilitaries during a protest at a church a few hundred feet from the school where Maduro voted.\"We've stoically withstood the terrorist, criminal violence,\" Maduro said. \"Hopefully the world will respectfully extend its arms toward our country.\"In an unusual moment this morning when Maduro cast his own ballot on state-controlled national television, his national ID card was to be scanned. He intended to make a statement that his vote was counted and said: \"We are going to verify my national ID card so that the record shows that I came to vote and my ID card will show this for posterity, that I voted on this historic day of the constituent assembly of July 30th.\"Nicolas Maduro having his national ID card scanned. ReutersWhen the female official of the National Electoral Council (CNE) proceeds to use a smartphone to scan Maduro's card, a second camera zooms in to reveal that according to CNE's own system, that \"person does not exist, or the card has been revoked.\"After scanning Maduro's national ID card, the smartphone read: \"person does not exist, or the card has been revoked.\" ReutersMaduro appears livid but doesn't acknowledge the misshap, pauses for a second and then grabs his wife's ID card for scanning.Social media was abuzz with the misshap, which fanned the flames of speculation about the place of birth of the socialist president, whose mother is rumored to be a Colombian national. Following an opposition-mandated special commission investigation into the matter, the socialist-majority Supreme Court issued a ruling last October that stated that Maduro had been born in Caracas in 1962, but did not produce a birth certificate.Some opposition leaders continue to sustain that they have proof that Maduro was born a Colombian national, which would make him constitutionally ineligible to occupy the presidency.Maduro's highly vocal critic and former president of Colombia ridiculed Maduro in a tweet that reads: \"My fellow countryman, didn't they let you vote?\"Paisano \u00bf No te dejaron votar? https://t.co/ouVWI4eMtS \u2014 Andr\u00e9s Pastrana A (@AndresPastrana_) July 30, 2017Despite that hiccup, the opposition is boycotting Sunday's vote, contending the election has been structured to ensure Maduro's socialist party continues to dominate. So all 5,500 candidates for the 545 seats in the constituent assembly are his supporters and the vote's success is being measured by turnout.The government is encouraging participation with tactics that include offering social benefits like subsidized food to the poor and threatening state workers' jobs if they don't vote.\"I'm here because I'm hoping for housing,\" said Luisa Marquez, a 46-year-old hairdresser.Others said they were there out of conviction that the constitutional assembly would help the government fend off what they called an international capitalist conspiracy to undermine Venezuela's socialist system with the help of the domestic opposition.\"The crisis, the shortages of food and medicine, that isn't the government's fault,\" said Luis Osuna, a 42-year-old private bodyguard. \"Those who are attacking us to kill us with hunger and blame the government are the same enemies the government's always had.\"Women shout slogans during a protest held by Venezuelans in Spain against Venezuela's Constituent Assembly election, in Madrid, Spain, on July 30, 2017. ReutersOnce one of Latin America's wealthiest nations, Venezuela has spiraled into a devastating crisis during Maduro's four years in power, thanks to plunging oil prices and widespread corruption and mismanagement. Inflation and homicide rates are among the world's highest and widespread shortages of food and medicine have citizens dying of preventable illnesses and rooting through trash to feed themselves.The special assembly being selected Sunday will have powers to rewrite the country's 1999 constitution but will also have powers above and beyond other state institutions, including the opposition-controlled congress.While opinion polls say a vast majority oppose him, Maduro made clear in a televised address Saturday evening that he intends to use the assembly to govern without limitation, describing the vote as \"the election of a power that's above and beyond every other.\"He said he wants the assembly to strip opposition legislators of their constitutional immunity from prosecution and indicated he eager to prosecute many more members of the opposition parties that control a handful of state governments along with the National Assembly, providing one of the few remaining checks on the power of the socialist party that has ruled this OPEC nation for nearly two decades.\"The right wing already has its prison cell waiting,\" the president said. \"All the criminals will go to prison for the crimes they've committed.\"Saying the assembly will begin to govern within a week, Maduro said its first task in rewriting the constitution will be \"a total transformation\" of the office of Venezuela's chief prosecutor, a former government loyalist who has become the highest-ranking official to publicly split from the president.The Trump administration has imposed successive rounds of sanctions on high-ranking members of Maduro's administration, with the support of countries including Mexico, Colombia and Panama. Vice President Mike Pence promised on Friday that the U.S. would take \"strong and swift economic actions\" if the vote went ahead. He didn't say whether the U.S. would sanction Venezuelan oil imports, a measure with the potential to undermine Maduro but cause an even deeper humanitarian crisis here.Maduro's supporters on the Supreme Court set off the protests and clashes between police and demonstrator when they tried to strip the National Assembly of its powers in April. Most of the dead have been protesters apparently shot by police and government-linked paramilitaries.The opposition has organized a series of work stoppages as well as a July 16 protest vote that it said drew more than 7.5 million symbolic votes against the constitutional assembly.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle burn <extra_id_0> Artifact barricade <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle detonated <extra_id_0> Artifact motorcycles <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle burn <extra_id_0> Artifact Motorcycles <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Belgium Police Release New Video of Brussels Bombing SuspectPARIS \u2014\u00a0Belgian police have released new video of a wanted Brussels airport bombing suspect even as the lawyer for a Paris attacks suspect says his extradition may take a few more weeks.Released Thursday in French and Flemish, the police video shows the minutes following the March 22 Zaventem Airport bombings and the apparent getaway of the third surviving suspect -- often identified in the media as \"the man with the hat.\" Local media previously released security camera video of the man at Zaventem Airport shortly before the bombings, wearing a hat and a light jacket and walking alongside suicide bombers Ibrahim el-Bakraoui and Najim Laachraoui. All three men are seen pushing carts with bags on them.With running commentary in French and Flemish, the police footage shows the third man leaving the airport after the bombs went off at 7:58 a.m. First he is walking, then he breaks into a jog. His face is not seen clearly in the new images.Watch video released by FedPol Belgium:We are sorry, but this feature is currently not availableAccording to Belgian authorities, the man walked more then 10 kilometers in the ensuring hours, crossing the town of Zaventem with video finally showing him in the Schaerbeek area of Brussels, before disappearing at a crossroads at 09:50 local time. Police say he got rid of his jacket along the way, and subsequent footage shows him in shirtsleeves. He is described as wearing a light blue shirt, dark pants and brown shoes with wide white soles.Asking for citizens' help Belgian police have released local and international phone numbers for people to call if they have any information on the man or a jacket that looks like the one in the video.The Brussels airport attacks, along with a suicide bombing at the Maelbeek metro station in the Belgian capital about an hour later, killed 32 people and wounded more than 340.This photo provided on Wednesday, March 23, 2016 by Interpol shows Belgium's Khalid Bakraoui. Belgian state broadcaster RTBF has identified two of the attackers who targeted Brussels as brothers Khalid and Brahim Bakraoui.Ibrahim el-Bakraoui\u2019s brother, Khalid, was named as the suicide bomber in the metro attack. Both brothers had criminal records. Turkish authorities had earlier caught Ibrahim el-Bakraoui trying to cross into Syria and deported him.Authorities have found a tangle of links between the Brussels attacks suspects and those involved in the November attacks in Paris \u2014 including surviving Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam, who is believed to have been in charge of logistics. The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for both attacks.Born in France but brought up in Belgium, Abdeslam was arrested days before the Brussels attacks and is currently in a high-security Belgian prison awaiting extradition to France. That move had been expected to be imminent, but his Belgian lawyer, Sven Mary, told journalists Thursday that Abdeslam\u2019s extradition would not happen for several weeks.Lawyer Mary also said Abdeslam was not formally implicated to date in the Brussels attacks.A Belgian police officer secures the area around the European Council headquarters following recent bomb attacks in the Brussels metro and at Belgian international airport of Zaventem, in Brussels, Belgium, March 30, 2016.Criticism of intelligence lapses Belgian authorities have been sharply criticized for intelligence lapses leading up to the attacks.The country\u2019s justice and interior ministers both tendered their resignations, which Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel refused to accept.Last month, Belgian authorities said they had arrested the suspected \"man with the hat,\" who the prosecutors\u2019 office identified as Faycal C., before releasing him days later, apparently for lack of sufficient evidence.Media identified him early on as Faycal Cheffou, a self-styled freelance journalist.

{"text": "Bologna, August 2, 1980. It was a hot Saturday morning, the first weekend of Italy\u2019s traditional holiday month, and thousands of vacationers jostled their way to and from the trains in Bologna\u2019s central railroad station. In the midst of that noisy crowd someone stopped midway between the second-class waiting room and the coffee bar, put down a heavy suitcase, and quickly left the station. The suitcase contained over forty pounds of explosives, perhaps stable nitroglycerine, connected to a timer. At exactly 10:25 AM it exploded, ripping through the crowd, tearing apart the reinforced concrete walls, and bringing the roof crashing down on hundreds of bodies and parts of bodies.In the bloody aftermath, rescue squads worked for over twelve hours to pull the dead and maimed from the rubble. As they labored, a young neofascist entered a telephone booth across town and dialed Bologna\u2019s leading newspaper. \u201cThis is the Armed Revolutionary Nuclei,\u201d he said. \u201cWe claim responsibility for the explosion in the railway station.\u201d The final toll: eighty-five dead\u2014the eldest an eighty-six-year-old man, the youngest a three-year-old child\u2014and more than two hundred wounded.Eight weeks later, on the evening of September 26, a young man, Gundolf Koehler, tried to place six pounds of explosives in a refuse can at the entrance to Munich\u2019s Oktoberfest. The bomb went off, killing him and twelve others, wounding 215 people. On Koehler\u2019s body were found documents linking him to the illegal paramilitary Defense Sport Group of the neo-Nazi Karl-Heinz Hoffmann, who styles himself the \u201cspiritual descendant\u201d of Adolf Hitler and who has organized military maneuvers in southern Germany for his followers. Arrested along with twenty-four of his militants, Hoffmann was later released for lack of evidence.A week later in Paris a twenty-six pound bomb exploded in front of the rue Copernic synagogue, where hundreds of Jews were gathered for sabbath services. The bomb killed four persons and wounded thirteen; if it had gone off twenty minutes later, when services would have ended, it would have killed scores of worshipers leaving the synagogue. The act was claimed by the European National Fasces (FNE), the same group that had machine-gunned five Jewish buildings in Paris a week earlier.These latest of neofascist massacres have awakened Europeans to what many of them had managed not to see: the maturation over the last five years of what analysts now call Eurofascism\u2014loosely associated but politically aligned neo-Nazi groups, many of them dedicated to terrorism, all of them intent on saving Europe from the twin evils of capitalism and Marxism. While their membership is relatively small, they are well funded and some have access to training camps in Lebanon. In an interview given eight days before the Munich explosion, the PLO leader Abu Ayad revealed that in late 1979 two members of Hoffmann\u2019s group were captured in Lebanon and confessed to him that they and some thirty other European fascists were training at the Falangist camp at Aquru, northeast of Beirut.

{"text": "The Taliban killed more than 100 members of the Afghan security forces inside a military compound in central Maidan Wardak province on Monday, a senior defense official said.\"We have information that 126 people have been killed in the explosion inside the military training center, eight special commandoes are among the dead,\" said a senior official in the defense ministry in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity.The official said the assault began on Monday morning when the attackers rammed a car full explosives through a military checkpoint and detonated the vehicle inside the campus of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) forces training center in Maidan Shahr, the capital of Maidan Wardak province.Two gunmen entered the campus right after the explosion and shot at many Afghan soldiers before being gunned down during the clashes.Defense ministry officials said the Taliban had used U.S.-made armored Humvee vehicles captured from Afghan forces as a car bomb in order to breach the military fortifications.A second source residing in Maidan Wardak province said more than 100 members of National Directorate of Security (NDS) were killed in the complex attack.\"I have been in touch with the NDS official in the province and they told me that over 100 members of the NDS were killed in the big explosion,\" the former provincial official said.Sharif Hotak, a member of the provincial council in Maidan Wardak said he saw bodies of 35 Afghan forces in the hospital.\"Many more were killed. Several bodies were transported to Kabul city and many injured were transferred to hospitals in Kabul,\" said Hotak, adding that \"the government was hiding the accurate casualty figures to prevent a further dip in the morale of the Afghan forces.\"\"The explosion was very powerful. The whole building has collapsed,\" he said.Government officials in Maidan Wardak and Kabul declined to comment when asked if they were obscuring the death toll.Two senior officials in the interior ministry said the exact casualty figures were not being disclosed to prevent unrest within the armed forces.\"I have been told not to make the death toll figures public. It is frustrating to hide the facts,\" said a senior interior ministry official in Kabul.A senior NDS official in Kabul said at least 50 people were killed or wounded in the complex attack.Abdurrahman Mangal, spokesman for the provincial governor in Maidan Wardak said 12 people were killed and 12 were injured when the car bomb exploded near the Afghan special forces unit.President Ashraf Ghani's office in a statement said the \"enemies of the country\" had carried out an attack against NDS personnel in Maidan Shahr. \"They killed and wounded a number of our beloved and honest sons.\"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan condemned the attack on Monday evening and extended his condolences to Ghani.Meanwhile, the Taliban said it met with U.S. officials in Qatar on Monday, in the latest round of talks between the insurgents and Washington aimed at bringing an end to the 17-year war.The U.S. has not officially commented on the reported meeting, which follows the last confirmed talks between the two parties in the UAE in December.\"Following American acceptance of the agenda of ending the occupation of Afghanistan and preventing Afghanistan from being used against other countries in the future, talks with American representatives took place today in Doha, the capital of Qatar,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.Taliban representatives have met several times with U.S. officials in recent months, but last week threatened to suspend the fledgling process, lambasting Washington for changing the agenda of the talks and \"unilaterally\" adding new subjects.The insurgents have long refused to hold direct talks with the Kabul government -- despite U.S. pleas -- which the Taliban dismisses as a puppet of Washington.In recent years the Afghan government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures. Last year Ghani has said 28,000 Afghan police officers and soldiers have been killed since 2015, breaking the longstanding suppression on casualty data.Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack. Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline terrorist group said they have killed 190 people in the complex attack.Last week, Taliban fighters set off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five people and wounding more than 110 Afghans and expatriates in the capital, Kabul.On Sunday, a suicide bombing in the southeastern province of Logar left eight policemen dead and another 10 wounded.The Taliban bombing targeted the provincial governor's convoy in Mohammad Agha district. The provincial governor and spy chief traveling in the convoy were unharmed.The Taliban have ramped up their attacks on security forces and government facilities in recent months, while Afghan and U.S. troops have increased operations against the militants' field commanders.Military sources say around 35 members of the country's security forces are killed every day in attacks and clashes.This is while the U.S. is still considering a significant troop drawdown in Afghanistan. Around 14,000 U.S. troops are stationed in the country, coupled with around 7,500 troops from other allied nations, according to RAND, a U.S. government research organization.In a report on Sunday, RAND said that if the U.S. considers \"an early and complete or near-complete departure unrelated to a negotiated peace settlement,\" it could push Afghanistan into a civil war while the Taliban would expand their control throughout the country.If the withdrawal does take place, RAND noted, \"the major advances that Afghans have achieved in democracy, press freedom, human rights, women's emancipation, literacy, longevity, and living standards will be rolled back throughout the country.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Killer The Taliban <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place training center <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack the assault  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target campus <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shot <extra_id_0> Target soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker gunmen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place campus <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Place complex <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize saw <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject bodies <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Identifier he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack suicide bombing <extra_id_0> Place southeastern <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim 10 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim policemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target convoy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact been in touch <extra_id_0> Participant official <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation transported <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact bodies <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination Kabul city <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation transferred <extra_id_0> Destination hospitals <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact injured <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place complex <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounding <extra_id_0> Victim expatriates <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice car bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place highly fortified compound <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact met <extra_id_0> Participant Taliban <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Qatar <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic bringing an end <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack war  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Killer They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim beloved and honest sons <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Injurer They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim beloved and honest sons <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "The 2019 Quetta bombing was a suicide bomb attack on an open marketplace in Quetta, Pakistan on 12 April, killing 21 people.The bombing took place near an area where many minority Shiite Muslims live.At least ten Hazara, including nine Shiites, were among the dead.Two paramilitary soldiers were also killed in the bombing.PM Imran Khan expressed condolences for the lives lost, directed the authorities to ensure the best medical treatment for the injured, and ordered an increase in security for Shiites and Hazara people.Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and ISIL later accepted responsibility for the

the attack in Quetta, we targeted the Hazara community.\"The same group had previously carried out attacks against Hazara minorities.ISIL also claimed the responsibility of this attack, releasing a

targeted but they weren\u2019t provided effective security.\"Provincial Home Minister Zia Lango visited the site but dialogue with the Hazara community failed once again on security purposes.Hazaras demanded security from Prime Minister Imran Khan.Shortly after the bombing struck near a Shiite residential area, dozens of angry Shiite youths rallied in Quetta, demanding more security from the authorities and the arrest of those behind the attacks.They also denounced the violence by Sunni extremists who have killed hundreds in similar attacks over the past years in Balochistan province.\"It seems people from the (Shiite) Hazara community were the target,\" said senior police chief Abdur Razzaq Cheema.Members of the Hazara community staged a sit-in at Quetta's Western Bypass for over 23 hours, demanded better security measures following the blast.Women and children are among those who staged a sit-in since shortly after the blast.The protesters demanded that the government implements an effective security plan and ensure the protection of the Hazara community.Pakistani Shiite youth from Hazara community burn tires to block the main road during a protest to condemn the attack.Hazara protesters refuse to end the Quetta sit-in even after the third day, with protesters continuing to block the western bypass.Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Syed Ali Haider Zaidi arrived in the provincial capital and met the affected families on the behalf of Prime Minister Imran Khan, stating \"Federal government claimed full responsibility of protecting its citizens regardless of their caste, creed, religion or province and Government is taking strict action and seriously pursuing the investigations into the suicide attack.\"However, the protesters refused to call off their sit-in, demanded the attendance of Prime Minister Imran Khan, the capture of people behind the suicide attack and security of Hazara people.Representing the protesters, advocate Tahir Hazara expressed dismay over the federal government's attitude and regretted that Prime Minister Imran Khan had no time to visit Quetta after the tragic incident.However, he stated no one was safe in Quetta, saying that along with ordinary people, security personnel too had been martyred, adding that it raised questions over the capabilities of the government.He said the state must act without further delay because the people were tired of lifting the coffins of their loved ones.Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) president Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal visited the protest camp of the Hazara community and expressed solidarity with the protestors.A large number of people also staged a protest demonstration outside the Quetta Press Club after marching on main roads, protests erupted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Punjab too.After 4 days, the Hazara community ends sit-in after receiving assurances from state minister, Balochistan CM.However, protesters still demanded Imran Khan to visit them, \"Prime Minister Imran Khan should come and console us,\" Muhammad Raza, another participant of the sit-in, had said.\"This time the government should go beyond words and do something practical for our protection.\"Minister of state of Interior Shehryar Khan Afridi had visited the Imam Bargah located in Hazara town to condole with the bereaved family members, speaking to the media, Afridi said \"The federal government will play its role in making sure that these heinous crimes end, I stand  with the community and I assure you that the government has been working to ensure that such crimes end.That is why this was the first such incident to occur over the span of nine months,\" \"we won't let anyone divide Pakistan\", he added.On 16 April, both President Arif Alvi and the opposition party's leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited Quetta to offer condolences to Hazara community, President Arif Alvi showed solidarity to families and said \"The entire nation stands by the Hazara community in this hour of grief,\" acknowledged it was the responsibility of the state to protect the people and said \"Nation stands united.\"Earlier, talking to media persons in Quetta, the president had reaffirmed the government's commitment towards the implementation of the National Action Plan and  commended CM Balochistan's commitment of announcing a compensation package for the victims.Meanwhile, Opposition Leader Bilawal Zardari condemns the government and point out their duel standards, he said, \"On one hand they say the government is standing with the victims of the incident, and on the other a video exists where a federal minister is seen giving assurances to murderers and saying that no one will be able to touch them, Till when will have these dual standards, till when will this terrorism continue, victims need to be mainstreamed not terrorists.\"He showed condolence to the victims and also praised the army for eliminating the terrorists in recent years but he also provoked the emotional sentiments, stated, \u201cNo one can fight extremism alone, but we have to decide for the future.We need to fight this extremist mindset.When we ask for justice, we are called an enemy of the state.When I speak against banned organisations, I\u2019m branded an enemy of the state.\"he referred to his recent controversy where he was accused of using the Indian Sentiments against Pakistan's Government of not taking strict action against terrorist's organisations.Arif Alvi also promised that Imran Khan will visit Balochistan on April 18.Khan will visit the

Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels.The police academy car bombing \u201cwas a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [Cuba acting] to avoid justice being done\u201d, Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima.Colombians, including Duque, planned to join in a march on Sunday to protest against the car bombing, the worst such attack in the country in 16 years.Last rebel groupIn November, Colombia asked Cuba to capture ELN rebel commander Nicolas Rodriguez and provide information about the presence of other commanders in the Cuban territory.The government in Bogota also asked Havana to act on an Interpol Red Notice against Rodriguez. The Cuban government did not respond publicly to that request or made a statement about the issue.Colombia has experienced several years of relative calm since the 2016 peace accord signed by then-President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) fighters.190118182118648With the landmark agreement turning the former rebels into a political party, the smaller ELN is considered the last active rebel group in the country.True to his election promises, Duque has taken a hard line against the ELN.Peace talks with the ELN began in February 2017 under Santos, but Duque has put them on hold until the rebels free all their hostages and stop attacks on military and civilian targets.The group is believed to be currently holding 17 hostages, some of them for several years.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand request <extra_id_0> Communicator Colombia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Cuba <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ImpedeInterfereWith sidesteps <extra_id_0> Impeder Cuba <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Bogota <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker National Liberation Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand urged <extra_id_0> Communicator Ivan Duque <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Cuba <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim attacker <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer ELN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker ELN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target academy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Bogota <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand asked <extra_id_0> Communicator Colombia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Cuba <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain capture <extra_id_0> Detainee Nicolas Rodriguez <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protest <extra_id_0> Demonstrator Colombians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Suspected New York Bomber Wounded in Shootout with PoliceThe suspect in Saturday night's bombing in New York City that wounded 29 people is in a hospital recovering from bullet wounds after a shootout with police.Prosecutors have charged 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami with five counts of attempted murder stemming from the shootout that wounded two officers.Police arrested Rahami in Linden, New Jersey \u2014 outside Manhattan \u2014 hours after police sent out a city-wide bulletin with his picture, saying he was wanted for questioning.A bar owner in Linden called police Monday morning to complain that a man was sleeping in a doorway of his business. Officers recognized the man as Rahami, who opened fire, wounding two policemen before he was injured.None of the wounds are considered life-threatening.Police officers walk near the site where Ahmad Khan Rahami, sought in connection with a bombing in New York, was taken into custody in Linden, New Jersey, U.S., Sept. 19, 2016.The FBI is not saying how they zeroed in on Rahami as the bombing suspect. But investigators reportedly saw him on surveillance video at the bomb site in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, and near a second bomb allegedly left several blocks away. The second explosive was found before it could detonate.Investigators also reportedly found fingerprints on a bomb fragment.Video sizewidthxheightpixelsFollowing Terror Suspect Capture, New York Remains VigilantShare this video0:02:12\u25b60:00:00/0:02:12\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 6.3MB360p | 9.9MB720p | 56.3MBOther bombsThe FBI wants to question Rahami about another bombing Saturday morning in Seaside Park, New Jersey, south of New York, that forced the cancellation of a charity road race.

Again, no one was hurt.FILE - Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials label and collect evidence near the site of an explosion which took place on Saturday night in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, Sept. 18, 2016.Rahami's alleged motive for the bombings is unknown.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Rahami is the only suspect so far. The mayor on Monday said there is every reason to believe the bombings were acts of terrorism, and the FBI is looking for any links to foreign terror groups.Obama: We have to be vigilantSpeaking in New York, President Barack Obama said the investigation is moving rapidly and that everyone is working together to get to the bottom of what happened. He said terrorists and extremists want to hurt innocent people, inspire fear and disrupt life.President Barack Obama speaks about last Saturday's bombing in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood in New York, Sept. 19, 2016.\"We have to be vigilant and aggressive, both on preventing senseless acts of violence but also making sure that we find those who carry out such acts and bring them to justice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don't succumb to that fear.\"One New Yorker told VOA that the bombing was unsettling, but not surprising.\"There is a security to this city. Sure there are days where I have my doubts about that, but because I do feel this camaraderie in the city, I do feel relatively safe.\"Suspect called friendlySuspected bomber Rahami was born in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He and his family run a fried-chicken restaurant in Linden that has a steady number of loyal customers. But it also had trouble with the city of Linden for what neighbors said was round-the-clock noise and crowds at the eatery.Some of the restaurant's customers say they are shocked that Rahami is a suspect, calling him friendly. They say he let local bands practice in the back of the restaurant, and gave them free food.New York City Afghan community leader Masjid Dar al Taqwa condemned the bombings.\"Everyone ... is shocked and saddened by what has happened,\" he told VOA. \"They condemn all forms of violence.

Every time someone tells this government the truth in connection with a disease, an economic problem or a security issue, that person automatically becomes a coup-plotter,\u201d said Douglas N\u00e1tera, president of the federation.Health Minister Nancy P\u00e9rez, who has held that portfolio for just a few days, made a public statement on Wednesday to address the growing social alarm.\u201cThe main thing is that there is no strange virus right now. The moment some disease crops up, the people of Venezuela will know about it, because it is not state policy to conceal information but rather to disclose it and to take the necessary measures.\u201dFor every patient diagnosed with Chikungunya, there could be as many as 1,000 moreYet the minister admitted to 45,745 confirmed cases of dengue fever and 398 more of the Chikungunya virus, which causes acute joint pains and is also spread by mosquitoes. Another 1,200 patients are under observation.But Rafael Arreaza, a surgeon and former director of Venezuela\u2019s Social Security service, questioned the minister\u2019s figures and filed a complaint against the government with the Ombudsman.Arreaza said that for every patient diagnosed with Chikungunya, there could be as many as 1,000 more, and that the lack of lab material is preventing health workers from knowing the true magnitude of the problem.This former health official also said that 12 of the victims who died were showing similar symptoms, suggesting the need to find out whether the virus is mutating.In the face of this mounting pressure, President Maduro said he will take national and international legal action against any physician but also against any journalist, media outlet or individual who contributes to disseminating this theory through words or images.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak disease <extra_id_0> Place Venezuela <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak Chikungunya <extra_id_0> Victim patient <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak Chikungunya <extra_id_0> Victim patient <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak virus <extra_id_0> Victim victims <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Investigation of the Belated Production of Documents in the Oklahoma City Bombing Case\"The bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on April 19, 1995, was, at the time, the most significant act of terrorism that had ever taken place in the United States. Government agencies, led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), immediately began an extensive investigation to identify and prosecute the culprits. The investigation, known as OKBOMB, was run by a Task Force that consisted primarily of FBI investigators and support personnel and Department of Justice prosecutors. Within a few months, three individuals-Timothy McVeigh, Terry Nichols, and Michael Fortier-were indicted for crimes relating to the bombing. McVeigh and Nichols were convicted after trials, and Fortier pled guilty as part of a plea agreement with the government. McVeigh, who had devised the plot to bomb the Murrah Building and had planted the bomb, was sentenced to death. On May 8, 2001, one week before McVeigh's scheduled execution date, the Department of Justice and the FBI revealed to McVeigh's and Nichols' attorneys that over 700 investigative documents had not been disclosed to the defendants before their trials. The government acknowledged that it had violated a discovery order in the case, and the Attorney General stayed McVeigh's execution for one month in order to resolve the legal issues arising from the belated disclosure. Following the public revelation of the problem, and after finding and releasing more than 300 additional OKBOMB documents to the defense, the FBI came under severe criticism for its handling of the OKBOMB documents.\"United States.

The police said the radiation was low and did not pose a threat. The stunt initially brought fears of a terrorist attack.Yasuo Yamamoto, who is unemployed, faces a maximum three years in prison if convicted on charges of obstruction of official business.

It was believed to have landed there two weeks ago.\u201cI was operating the drone around 3:30 in the morning on April 9 to express my opposition to nuclear power generation,\u201d police quoted the alleged drone operator as saying.The Asahi Shimbun said the man surrendered to police on Friday.

{"text": "The Minister of Health, Nancy Perez, spoke today on the status of two diseases currently affecting Venezuelans: chikungunya and dengue fever. Perez confirmed that so far in 2014, there have been 398 cases of chikungunya and 45,745 cases of dengue fever in the country.Both diseases are mosquito-borne. The mortality rate for dengue fever ranges between 1-5%. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the mortality for chikungunya during an outbreak in Africa in 2005-2006 was nearly 0%.Perez conceded that the country is experiencing a shortage of acetaminophen, a medicine used as a pain killer and fever reducer used to combat the symptoms of the diseases. However, Perez assured, the government is doing all it can to resolve the shortage.Doctors Want Emergency DeclaredThe head of the infectious diseases department at the Hospital Universitario de Caracas, Maria Eugenia Landaeta, called on the government today to declare the chikungunya outbreak an emergency. Landaeta said:It\u2019s the first thing you should do because that allows for planification and for the allocation of resources to attack the virus.Landaeta also speculated that the nine unexplained deaths over the last week in Aragua might have been the result of complications from the disease. She said:What we\u2019re thinking, based on the symptoms, is that it could be an instance of complicated cases of chikungunya.She also dismissed the rumours that the disease might be ebola, saying that as far as she was aware none of the victims had any contact whatsoever with anyone from Africa. Landaeta also called on Venezuelans to think critically, and to not fall into a \u201ccollective panic\u201d regarding these diseases.Alleged Ongoing Confrontation Leaves Students InjuredAn alleged ongoing confrontation in or around the Universidad de Los Andes campus in Tachira state between students and security forces has left at least one student injured.

President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was attending a ceremony to celebrate the 81st anniversary of the National Guard in Caracas on August 4, 2018.Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro survived an alleged assassination attempt via drone on Saturday when a flying device carrying explosives detonated during a speech he was delivering in Caracas.Maduro, an unpopular leader who has presided over one of the worst economic collapses in Latin America in recent history, blamed the \"far right,\" including Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, for the attack.Here\u2019s what happened: On Saturday evening, Maduro was addressing the crowd at a military parade celebrating the 81st anniversary of the National Guard when a flying device approached and exploded, according to Venezuelan officials.Footage of the event, which was broadcast on live television, shows Maduro look up mid-speech, while his wife Cilia Flores, who is standing behind him, flinches.For a few seconds, no one appears to react, as they seem to be processing what\u2019s happened.\"Seconds later, there was a second explosion,\" Maduro said in a national address recounting the incident.Then the crowd disperses and people flee.Some images on Twitter capture the chaos and aftermath.Quisieron poner a prueba lealtades-de la Fuerza Armada y del pueblo sobre todo- y ya ven que somos infranqueables a la hora de defender nuestro proceso revolucionario y a nuestro l\u00edder @NicolasMaduro El fascismo No pasar\u00e1.pic.twitter.com/Nsa0fY4fOc\u2014 freddy \u00f1a\u00f1ez (@luchaalmada) August 5, 2018Seven members of the National Guard were harmed in the attack, Information Minister Jorge Rodr\u00edguez said at a press conference after the incident.He added that Maduro was unharmed and in a \"perfect state of health.\"\"This was an attempt to kill me,\" Maduro later said in a retelling of what happened.\"Today they attempted to assassinate me.\"Firefighters at the scene disputed that account, however, telling the Associated Press that a gas tank had exploded nearby.Maduro, 55, said he believed the attempted attack was part of a right-wing plot against him that was working with opponents in Bogot\u00e1 and Miami, including Santos, the outgoing Colombian president.He provided no evidence to back up his accusations.The Colombian government called Maduro\u2019s charges \"absurd.\"Other countries expressed support for Maduro after the attack, including Turkey, Syria, Nicaragua, and Russia.Bolivian President Evo Morales in a series of tweets expressed solidarity with Maduro and described the attempt as a \"crime against humanity.\"A little-known group called Soldiers in T-Shirts claimed responsibility for the act, saying they planned to fly two drones at the president but the devices were shot down.The AP couldn\u2019t verify the claims, and the group didn\u2019t respond to a message from the outlet when it reached out for comment.National Security Adviser John Bolton said in an appearance onFox News Sundaythat the United States had \"no involvement\" in the incident.\"If the government of Venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of US criminal law, we\u2019ll take a serious look at it, but in the meantime I think what we really should focus on is the corruption and oppression in the Maduro regime in Venezuela,\" he said.The political situation in Venezuela is badMaduro, a former bus driver who took over as president after former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez died in 2013, has overseen a catastrophic economic collapse in Venezuela.The socialist economy, once thriving, has spiraled since global oil prices dropped in 2014.Venezuelans suffer from widespread food and medicine shortages, and the majority of the country is living in poverty.Seventy-five percent of the country\u2019s population lost an average of 19 pounds of bodyweight between 2015 and 2016, and the International Monetary Fund expects inflation in Venezuela to reach 13,000 percent in 2018.Thousands of Venezuelans are fleeing the country.Yet Maduro remains in power.He won reelection in May due to a largely rigged election.He banned two of the most popular opposition leaders, Leopoldo Lopez and Henrique Capriles, from running against him, and implied that any Venezuelans who didn\u2019t vote for him could lose government food subsidies.His election is likely to worsen the economic crisis in Venezuela: Instead of electing a reformer who might enact the measures necessary to pull the country out of the state it\u2019s in right now, such as addressing its currency exchange policy and diversifying the economy away from oil dependence, the country now has Maduro for another six years.And he remains defiant \u2014 in the face of opposition, or alleged assassination attempts.Update: Story updated with comments from John Bolton.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument drone

{"text": "Manchester Bomber\u2019s Blast Felt on Street Where He Grew UpMANCHESTER, ENGLAND \u2014\u00a0The British-born jihadist behind the worst terror attack in Britain in more than a decade in effect killed and maimed people he\u2019d grown up with \u2014 making the atrocity even more horrifying for Manchester residents still struggling to come to terms with a bombing that killed 22 people and injured 59 others at a concert of American pop star Ariana Grande.As the British government raised the terrorist threat level to \"critical\" \u2014 only the second time authorities have done so \u2014 details began to emerge of the 22-year-old suicide bomber Salman Abedi, his Libyan paternity, and his alleged ties to a well-known recruiter for the Islamic State terror group and other known jihadists.He only recently returned from a three-week trip to Libya, according to family members. British police sources say the trip raises the possibility he may have met with members of the terror group\u2019s affiliate in the North African country to plot the attack and to receive training.Known to police The portrait drawn of the mass killer who packed his improvised explosive device with nails, nuts and bolts to maximize the slaughter, is a mixed one.Some neighbors describe him as a football-obsessed fan of Manchester United and keen enthusiast of computer games.They insist there were no signs the student dropout became radicalized. British security services acknowledged Abedi was known to them \u2014 there are some reports the intelligence service may have tried to persuade him to act as an informant \u2014 but they did not see him as a high risk.Others, though, describe a young man full of rage, who denounced a local mosque leader for his criticism of IS. They say he started to pray openly in the streets.A police officer stands outside Didsbury mosque in Manchester, May 24, 2017.A local imam, Mohammed Saeed, told British newspapers Abedi stopped attending his mosque in 2015 after they argued over IS. \u201cSalman used to come to the mosque occasionally, he wasn\u2019t particularly friendly towards me because he didn\u2019t like my anti-IS sermons. He didn\u2019t like what I was saying and showed me the face of hate. He came to the mosque less and less after that.\u201dSon of Libyan emigresAbedi was born in Manchester in 1994, the third of four children, three boys and one girl. His parents were Libyan emigres who found a home in the northern English city after fleeing the Moammar Gadhafi regime in 1980.His father, Ramadan Abedi, a former security guard at Manchester Airport, returned to Libya in 2011 to join the uprising against the Libyan autocrat. Since Gadhafi\u2019s overthrow his parents spent more time in the North African country than in their home in south Manchester, less than two miles from the scene of Monday\u2019s bombing.Police officers arrive at a residential property on Elsmore Road in Fallowfield, Manchester, on May 24, 2017, as investigations continue into the May 22 terror attack at the Manchester Arena.Libyan emigres in Manchester say the bomber\u2019s father had no time for jihadist ideology. \u201cHe was always very confrontational with jihadi ideology, and this ISIS thing isn\u2019t even jihad, it\u2019s criminality. The family will be devastated,\u201d one told local newspapers.According to the Daily Mirror newspaper, Abedi was a family friend of Raphael Hostey, also known as Abu Qaqa al-Britani, who helped recruit other young Britons for Islamic State via social media until he was killed in a drone strike in Syria last year. British police sources say his ties to Hostey are being probed by counter-terror officials who fear Abedi may have been part of a terror cell, a concern heightened by a trip he made to Libya in the run-up to the bombing.Police also remain skeptical that Abedi could have built the bomb alone because of its sophistication.RadicalizationAbedi attended local schools and then went on to study business and management at nearby Salford University. In a statement, a university spokesman described him as \"completely off the radar. He turned up for lectures for two years and then just stopped coming.\u201dA sign on the front door of a house reads \"Stop Knocking On This Door - We Know Nothing About This Family!!\" is pictured on Elsmore Road in Fallowfield, Manchester, on May 24, 2017.In the last year-and-half both Abedi and his older brother, 23-year-old Ismail, were active on social media sites, praising jihadists. Police arrested Ismail Monday night hours after the blast. He taught Arabic classes at the Didsbury mosque and, according to locals, was reported to police after concerns were raised about what he was teaching.Police are also probing the links between the Abedi brothers and another British-Libyan from Manchester, Abdalraouf Abdallah, who was sentenced to a nine-year-prison term after being convicted of funding terrorism and preparing acts of terrorism.Some analysts argue there were plenty of warning signs about Abedi. In a recent study of young British jihadists for the Henry Jackson Society, a London-based think tank, researcher Emma Webb noted a failure of various agencies and educational institutions to share relevant information about individuals vulnerable to radicalization.She urged police and social services to share \u201crelevant information on vulnerable individuals so the full picture is known across all agencies.\u201d", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Injure maimed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1>

{"text": "Teaching student jailed over Sweden terror plotThe 20-year-old and his lawyer.Photo: Janerik Henriksson/TTA 20-year-old former teaching student has been locked up for five years for plotting a suicide attack in Sweden.Aydin Sevigin was arrested in February, suspected of having tried to build a bomb.Police found six bottles of aceton, duct tape, a mobile phone and bullets during a search of his home.A receipt for Christmas tree lights and surveillance footage showing him buying a pressure cooker from Ikea were also part of the case.The 20-year-old, who grew up in the well-off suburb Danderyd north of Stockholm, denied the claims, but refused to explain why he bought the ingredients, which can be used to build bombs.\"My opinion is that he acquired, stored and collected liquids and objects to make and then blow up a suicide bomb in order to become a martyr.The criminal act being prepared could seriously have hurt Sweden,\" prosecutor Ewamari H\u00e4ggkvist said ahead of the verdict.Attunda District Court, north of Stockholm, sentenced him to five years in jail on Thursday morning for \"preparing to commit a terror crime\".It said it had reduced the sentence by one year because he is aged under 21.\"It is not clear what would have been the target of a bomb attack.But we believe that blowing up a shrapnel bomb of this kind would have been able to harm Sweden and that the purpose of such a bomb must have been to instil fear in the way referred to by terrorism legislation,\" said the chairman of the court, Mikael Swahn, in a statement.Sevigin's relatives had raised the alarm several months before he was arrested.In June last year one of his family members called the police, saying he was concerned about the 20-year-old, who had then disappeared.He was shortly thereafter stopped in Turkey on two occasions.The first time he was made to return to Greece, the second time he was flown back to Sweden from Istanbul.His intention is believed to have been to travel onwards to Syria to join Isis.Several of his relatives stated during the investigation and trial that the 20-year-old had been experiencing symptoms of depression, isolating himself from others and expressing radical opinions sympathizing with Isis.It was not immediately known if his legal team would attempt to appeal the sentence.The verdict came on the same day as a separate terror trial got under way in Sweden.A 25-year-old man is charged with attempting to travel to Syria to join a militant group.The trial is the first of its kind applying Sweden's new anti-terror laws making it illegal to travel abroad to join terror organizations.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain jailed <extra_id_0> Detainee Teaching student <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer Sweden <extra_id_1>

{"text": "How Many US Troops Were Killed By Iranian IEDs in Iraq?Far fewer than Congress thinks, according to newly declassified documents from U.S. Central Command.Explosively formed penetrators \u2014 a particularly deadly form of roadside bomb \u2014 killed 196 American soldiers in Iraq over a five-and-a-half-year period, according to recently declassified Pentagon documents.That\u2019s about half as many deaths as lawmakers have attributed to the bombs, which U.S. officials say were largely supplied by Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force.The carnage wrought by EFPs returned to the news over the summer, as opponents of the nuclear deal with Iran cited Tehran\u2019s behind-the-scenes actions against U.S. troops during Operation Iraqi Freedom as a reason to scuttle the agreement.Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who is also running for president, and others in Congress have said that EFPs had killed more than 500 troops.\u201cI understand that the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency has a classified list of roughly 500 American soldiers who were murdered by Iranian IEDs,\u201d Cruz said at a July 29 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.But data from U.S. Central Command, which runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East, suggests the actual toll is far less.According to the first comprehensive accounting, between November 2005 and December 2011, 1,526 EFPs killed a total of 196 U.S. troops and injured 861.Between October 2006 and September 2007, EFPs killed 97 U.S. troops and wounded more than 300 soldiers.EFP attacks peaked in March, April and May 2008, near the end of the American troop surge, when 200 of the bombs were detonated.The deadliest month was April 2008, when EFPs killed 15 U.S. soldiers.The Pentagon attributes the presence of EFPs in Iraq to the Quds Force, the special forces arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard led by Qasem Soleimani.Various EFP \u201cfactories\u201d were found throughout Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.Still, the exact degree to which Iran bears culpability for arming Shia militias in Iraq with EFPs and related equipment is a matter of some dispute.\u201cWe weren\u2019t always able to attribute the casualties that we had to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we didn't necessarily have the forensics to support that,\u201d Gen. Joseph Dunford, the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at his July 9 confirmation hearing.During the hearing, Dunford said the numbers of American soldiers killed by Iran \u201chas been recently quoted as about 500.\u201dCENTCOM later clarified that Dunford was referring to total American deaths by EFPs and other Iranian weapons.It is \u201cimportant to understand that the CENTCOM statistics on EFP detonations are a subset of all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during OIF,\u201d Maj. Genieve David, a CENTCOM spokeswoman, said in an email.Data about the roughly 300 deaths not caused by EFPs, including the kind of weapons used in the attacks, is classified, David said.A few weeks later, at the July 29 hearing, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the outgoing Joint Chiefs chairman, said \u201cseveral hundred\u201d American forces were killed by EFPs.Phil Novack, a spokesman for Cruz, told Defense One that the Senator's office is working with the Pentagon to get specific numbers.He said Cruz used the 500 number based on Dunford's testimony.Cruz \u201casked Secretary Carter to inform the families of the 500 service members who were killed by Iranian EFPs that their loved ones were murdered by the same man who will now receive sanctions relief,\u201d Novack said in an email.\u201cWhether the number is 500 lives or 196 is immaterial; the fact remains that General Soleimani \u2014 a man responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American service members \u2014 will receive sanctions relief to the tune of millions of dollars if this deal is approved.\"The arrival of EFPs on the Iraqi battlefield around 2005 came as a shock to U.S. planners.Along with more run-of-the-mill improvised explosive devices, the deadly bombs drove a crash effort to create and deploy vehicles with far better armor.Whereas most roadside bombs send energy and shrapnel in all directions, EFPs work more like cannons.The force of the blast molds a concave metal disc, called a liner, into a \u201cformed penetrator\u201d which is propelled at up to 3,000 meters per second.The effect is incredibly destructive, even to up-armored Humvees.\u201cYou can do as much or more damage with a 5-pound EFP, which is aimed, as with a 200-pound conventional IED,\u201d a Pentagon analyst told Los Angeles Times writer Andrew Cockburn in 2007.The analyst speculated that the cost to construct such a device was about $30 or less.They\u2019ve been around since at least World War II, when resistance elements in Europe used them against Germans, Cockburn wrote.Among the other Iranian arms introduced to the Iraqi battlefield is the improvised rocket assisted munition, described in one Joint IED Defeat Organization document as \u201ca rocket-fired improvised explosive device made from a large metal canister \u2014 such as a propane gas tank \u2014 filled with explosives, scrap metal and ball bearings and propelled by rockets.\u201dFirst seen in Iraq in 2007, the IRAM \u2014 \u201cessentially an airborne version of a roadside bomb \u2014 a flying IED\u201d is \u201dthe signature weapon used by Iranian-backed militias that operate with the aid of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Group,\u201d the undated document says.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die Killed <extra_id_0> Victim Troops

{"text": "The 2001 shoe bomb attempt was a failed bombing attempt that occurred on December 22, 2001, on American Airlines Flight 63.The aircraft, a Boeing 767-300 (registration N384AA) with 197 passengers and crew aboard, was flying from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France, to Miami International Airport in the U.S. state of Florida.The perpetrator, Richard Reid, was subdued by passengers after unsuccessfully attempting to detonate plastic explosives concealed within his shoes.The flight was diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston, escorted by American jet fighters, and landed without further incident.Reid was arrested and eventually sentenced to 3 life terms plus 110 years, without parole.==Incident==As Flight 63 was flying over the Atlantic Ocean, Richard Reid \u2013 an Islamic fundamentalist from the United Kingdom, and self-proclaimed Al-Qaeda operative \u2013 carried shoes that were packed with two types of explosives.He had been refused permission to board the flight the day before.Passengers on the flight complained of a smoke smell shortly after meal service.One flight attendant, Hermis Moutardier, walked the aisles of the plane to locate the source.She found Reid sitting alone near a window, attempting to light a match.Moutardier warned him that smoking was not allowed on the airplane, and Reid promised to stop.A few minutes later, Moutardier found Reid leaning over in his seat, and unsuccessfully attempted to get his attention.After she asked him what he was doing, Reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse leading into the shoe, and a lit match.He was unable to detonate the bomb: perspiration from his feet dampened the triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and prevented it from igniting.Moutardier tried grabbing Reid twice, but he pushed her to the floor each time, and she screamed for help.When another flight attendant, Cristina Jones, arrived to try to subdue him, he fought her and bit her thumb.The  tall Reid who weighed about 215 pounds (97kg) was subdued by other passengers on the aircraft and immobilized using plastic handcuffs, seatbelt extensions, and headphone cords.A doctor administered diazepam found in the flight kit of the aircraft.Many of the passengers only became aware of the situation when the pilot announced that the flight was to be diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston.Two F-15 fighter jets escorted Flight 63 to Logan Airport.The plane parked in the middle of the runway, and Reid was arrested on the ground while the rest of the passengers were bussed to the main terminal.Authorities later found over 280\u00a0grams (10\u00a0oz) of TATP and PETN hidden in the hollowed soles of Reid's shoes, enough to blow a substantial hole in the aircraft.He pleaded guilty, was convicted, sentenced to 3 life terms plus 110 years without parole and incarcerated at Supermax prison ADX Florence.== Aftermath ==Six months after the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in Queens, New York on November 12, 2001, Mohammed Mansour Jabarah agreed to cooperate with American authorities in exchange for a reduced sentence.He said that fellow Canadian Abderraouf Jdey had been responsible for the flight's destruction, using a shoe bomb similar to that found on Reid several months earlier.This claim remains unsubstantiated by the investigation into the cause of the crash; Jabarah was a known colleague of Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, and said that Reid and Jdey had both been enlisted by the al-Qaeda chief to participate in identical plots.In 2006, security procedures at US airports were changed to have people remove their shoes before proceeding through scanners, in response to this incident.The requirement was phased out for some travelers, particularly those with TSA PreCheck, in the 2010s.Flight Number AAL63 continues to be used on the route from Paris to Miami.==External links==* Bomb on Flight 63 Telegraph Media Group

{"text": "DIY Drone Instructable: How To Deliver a PayloadOverviewThese instructions guide you to build a DIY payload delivery drone system that can be mounted on your drone/quadcopter and used to deliver a package to any address.The smart, low-cost delivery solution uses GPS to find its destination and then employs an ultrasonic sensor to measure the ground clearance.Depending on your drone capabilities, this payload system can lift up to 2kg freight.A servo motor is used to release the payload at the desired location.This guide also provides a solution to the sensor integration problem.You can integrate GPS, servo, and ultrasonic sensors without any serial interference.DIY payload delivery drone systemComponentsBreadboardArduino Mega/UnoServo motor SG90Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04GPS module NEO-6M-001Connecting wiresA bottle capGlue/TapeHair pinBreadboardArduino Mega/UnoServo motor SG90Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04GPS module NEO-6M-001connecting wiresbottle caphair pinStep 1: Connecting the Ultrasonic SensorTake the breadboard and affix the Arduino to its one side, as shown in the picture.Now, take the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and attach it to the lower side of the breadboard.Make the connections as shown in Figure 1.Connect the pins as follows:Vcc (Ultrasonic) -> 5V (Arduino)GND (Ultrasonic) -> GND (Arduino)Trig pin (Ultrasonic) -> pin 8 (Arduino)Echo pin (Ultrasonic) -> pin 9 (Arduino)Run the following code to check if the ultrasonic sensor is functional.The Serial Monitor will show the following output:Step 2: Connecting the GPS ModuleTake the NEO-6M GPS module and insert its pins into the breadboard.Make connections as shown in Figure 2.Don\u2019t forget to download TinyGPS++ library if missing.Connect the pins as follows:Vcc (GPS module) -> 3.3V (Arduino)2GND (GPS module) -> GND (Arduino)RX pin (GPS module) -> pin 1 (Arduino)TX pin (GPS module) -> pin 0 (Arduino)Figure 2Run the following code and check if the GPS sensor is functional.DON\u2019T FORGET to remove the TX pin of GPS module from pin 0 of Arduino; otherwise, your code won\u2019t upload.Once the code is uploaded, first open Serial Monitor; then, connect the TX pin of GPS to pin 0 to view the current location of drone, time, and date.The Serial Monitor will show output:Step 3: Connecting the Bottle CapNow, take a bottle cap to prepare the payload-releasing mechanism.The mechanism itself is simple.You hook the payload on the hairpin inside the bottle cap, and when the servo moves it pulls off the hairpin from the bottle cap, resulting the payload to drop.Make holes on both sides of the cap.Attach the cap on the lower side of the breadboard, as shown in the pictures.Step 4: Connecting the ServoFirst, take a hair pin and connect it to the limb of the servo using a staple, as shown in the picture.Take the servo and attach it under the breadboard such that the hair pin passes through both the holes of the bottle cap.Connect the Servo with Arduino in the following way, as shown in Figure 3.PWM Pin (Servo) -> Pin 14 (Arduino)Vcc Pin (Servo) -> 5V (Arduino)GND Pin (Servo) -> GND (Arduino)Figure 3It will look like this when you attach the whole system to your drone.Run the following code to check if the servo is functional.Step 5: Putting it All TogetherMake sure you make all the connections as shown in Figure 4.You\u2019ll integrate the sensors without using SoftwareSerial library.Employing hardware serial ports of your Arduino will minimize serial interference between libraries; hence, eliminating the servo vibration.Figure 4Open the Arduino window and paste the following code.In the code, set the desired GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude) where you need to drop off the basket.Once the desired location is added, click Upload.Again, don\u2019t forget to remove the TX pin of GPS from pin 0 before uploading the code.Upload the code on your Arduino and click the Serial Monitor icon in the top right corner.You\u2019ll see the current GPS coordinates of your drone.Let your drone fly to the desired location.When your drone reaches the desired address, bring it closer to the ground.The ultrasonic sensor will calculate the ground clearance.When it\u2019s about 15 cm, the servo releases the payload.The serial monitor prompts you when the package is delivered, and records the time as well.After dropping the payload, fly your drone back to its initial point.Precaution DO NOT put more than 2 kg load in the basket otherwise it will damage the assembly.Also be sure to check the spec of your drone so you will know how much weight that drone can handle.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Transportation Deliver <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Payload <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation deliver <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact package <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transporter your <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone/quadcopter <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination address <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation fly <extra_id_0> Transporter your <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination desired location <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation fly <extra_id_0> Transporter your <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination initial point <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble mounted <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler you <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components DIY payload delivery drone system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact drone/quadcopter <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble build <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler you <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact DIY payload delivery drone system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection measure <extra_id_0> Instrument ultrasonic sensor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle release <extra_id_0> Components payload <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument servo motor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place desired location <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble integrate <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler You <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components servo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact ultrasonic sensors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble affix <extra_id_0> Components Arduino <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact breadboard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble attach <extra_id_0> Components HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact breadboard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Connecting <extra_id_0> Components GPS Module <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble insert <extra_id_0> Components pins <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact breadboard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Connecting <extra_id_0> Components Bottle Cap <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Connecting <extra_id_0> Components Servo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Connect <extra_id_0> Components Servo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact Arduino <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection calculate <extra_id_0> Instrument ultrasonic sensor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation reaches <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination desired address, <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection find <extra_id_0> Instrument GPS <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble attach <extra_id_0> Components whole system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle remove <extra_id_0> Components GPS module <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble connect <extra_id_0> Components GPS <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Attach <extra_id_0> Components cap <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble integrate <extra_id_0> Components sensors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle releases <extra_id_0> Components payload <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact servo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Investigators: NY Bombing Suspect Bought Parts on eBayFederal investigators say the suspect in Saturday's bombings in New York and New Jersey bought components on eBay and used as triggering devices cell phones purchased from a store 500 meters from an address he once listed as his home.The details are contained in criminal complaints made public Tuesday spelling out multiple federal charges against 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami. Most of the charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.Authorities arrested Rahami on Monday after an exchange of gunfire with police that left him and two officers wounded.According to the court documents, investigators believe Rahami used an eBay account with the username \"ahmad rahami\" to buy citric acid, a circuit board, electric igniters and hundreds of ball bearings between June 20 and August 10. The items were shipped to a business in Perth Amboy, New Jersey where Rahami worked until September 12.Ball bearings were found in two pressure cooker bombs placed four blocks apart in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York late Saturday. One of them exploded, injuring 29 people, while the other was recovered intact. Investigators said the second bomb had \"numerous\" electric igniters.Ahmad Khan Rahami is taken into custody after a shootout with police Monday, Sept. 19, 2016.That second device was tested for fingerprints, and the criminal complaint said all 12 prints found were matches for Rahami. The documents say his prints were also found on items inside of a backpack that was discovered late Sunday at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, just outside of New York. The bag contained multiple explosive devices, including one that blew up as police tried to disarm it with a robot.Authorities also tied Rahami to a bomb that blew up in a trash can in Seaside Park, New Jersey early Saturday.That link involved one of the cell phones that investigators said were shipped last year to a store in Perth Amboy near the address that Rahami provided as his home in a 2012 passport application. They said a second phone shipped to the same place was used in the bomb that blew up in Chelsea.A third phone, one found with the other Chelsea bomb, was once registered to one of Rahami's family members, the documents said.Investigators also said they used surveillance video to tie Rahami to the Chelsea bombs, with cameras putting him near the explosion site about 37 minutes before the blast and near where the other bomb was found two minutes after the first one went off. That second video, they said, showed him pulling a suitcase and then a short time later walking without it.The documents contain some pieces of writing from a journal found on Rahami when he was arrested. The messages include praise of American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011, and \"Brother Osama Bin Laden,\" the former head of al-Qaida who was killed by U.S. forces in Pakistan in 2011.\"Inshallah the sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets. Gun shots to your police. Death To Your OPPRESSION,\" one message reads.The FBI said Tuesday it assessed Rahami's activities in 2014 after his father told agents he was concerned about his son's possible involvement with extremists.The agency found insufficient evidence to warrant further investigation.Rahami was born in Afghanistan, came to the U.S. at age 7 and became a naturalized American citizen.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell bought <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity components <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell purchased <extra_id_0> Giver store <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity cell phones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime criminal  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentence  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer Authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell buy <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity circuit board <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation shipped <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact items <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination New Jersey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice them <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle recovered <extra_id_0> Artifact other <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain custody <extra_id_0> Detainee Ahmad Khan Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew up <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew up <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Seaside Park <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew up <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Chelsea <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack went off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Anwar al-Awlaki <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator agency <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle disarm <extra_id_0> Artifact it <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Indonesian Police Receive Terrorist Threat Targeting BaliJAKARTA \u2014\u00a0In Indonesia there are growing concerns that more deadly attacks could follow last week\u2019 bombings in Jakarta by Islamist militants.Bali police Tuesday say they received an anonymous letter warning that the resort Island will be the next target for a terrorist assault.\"The letter was sent by an anonymous individual to Buleleng district, and the police are still conducting an investigation, and trying to find out who sent the letter. But again, I urge people in Bali not to be afraid, but they should stay alert,\" said Bali Police Chief Sugeng Priyanto.Authorities say they've increased security at shopping malls and other locations that draw crowds in Bali.In 2002, the popular resort island was targeted by Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), an Indonesia-based terrorist group with links to al-Qaida. The bombing of a club in Bali killed 202 people, mostly foreigners.The Bali bombing severely hurt Indonesia\u2019s tourism industry, and began a decade of deadly plots in Indonesia carried out by Southeast Asian militants affiliated with al-Qaida.Indonesia successfully combated the JI related terrorist threat through police action, intelligence operations and high profile criminal prosecutions.However, after last week's attack in the center of Jakarta that killed eight people, including four militants, Indonesian security forces are raising concerns that more and deadlier attacks could follow, carried out by groups inspired by Islamic State.Indonesian Special Police patrol at Ngurah Rai Airport in Denpasar on Indonesia's resort island of Bali on Jan. 15, 2016, one day after a series of explosions hit the Indonesian capital Jakarta.The Jakarta attack was the first of its kind in Southeast Asia to be attributed to Syria-based militant Islamists.Authorities say about 500 Indonesians have travelled to the Middle East to join the extremist group. About 100 are believed to have returned, although experts say only about 15 have combat experience.Jakarta back to normalSo far the renewed threat of terrorism has not instilled any widespread sense of panic or fear amongst Indonesians.A security personnel stand guard inside train carriage for women at Manggarai train station in Jakarta, Jan. 8, 2016.Life in Jakarta has quickly returned to normal, less than a week after the deadly attacks.On Tuesday the Starbucks coffee shop that was bombed remained closed and boarded up for repairs, but the memorial of flowers had been removed. Other shops have reopened and traffic at the busy intersection was congested as usual.'Ojek' heroThe \u201cojek\u201d motorcycle taxi drivers were again gathered at the intersection where the attack took place, waiting for their next fares.One of the \u201cojek\u201d drivers back at work is Muhamad Yunus, who has received widespread praise for the selfless courage he exhibited during the attack.The militant attackers last Thursday (January 14) set off two bombs, the first at the Starbucks and the second at a police traffic station in the middle of the intersection, near Jakarta's oldest department store, Sarinah.After the second explosion Yunus rushed to the police station to help the wounded even though the assailants were shooting at anyone in the area. He said he found a woman whose legs were severely injured and brought her to safety, away from the firefight.\u201cI got that woman and I told her, don\u2019t cry. Please be strong. Be strong. Please don\u2019t be sad,\u201d Yunus said.Yunus said he found out later that the woman and her nephew were stopped by the police for a traffic violation at the time of the blast. Her nephew died in the explosion.Kami tidak takutAfter the Jakarta attack there have been demonstrations by Indonesian Muslims to denounce terrorism and call for the government to eradicate radical militants and supporters of Islamic State in the country.A \"Pray for Jakarta\" message (top) is displayed on a screen as Indonesians gather outside the damaged Starbucks coffee shop in central Jakarta on Jan. 17, 2016 following the deadly gun and bomb attacks that rocked the city on Jan. 14.Indonesians also have started to use hashtags like \"PrayforJakarta\" and \"Kamitidaktakut\" or \"Wearenotafraid\" in English, on social media.Yunus\u2019s act of heroism has been held up as an example of Indonesia\u2019s resolve to stand up against terrorism.\u201cI am not afraid. We won\u2019t be scared any more,\u201d he said.Dismantling terror networksMeanwhile Indonesian authorities have promised to intensify their efforts to monitor radical networks in the country.Police believe the alleged mastermind of the Jakarta attack, an Indonesian fighting with Islamic State in Syria called Bahrun Naim, used social media to communicate his radical ideas to followers in Indonesia.In December police say they successfully disrupted plans by militants to launch a string of deadly attacks on Christmas and New Year celebrations, as well as against the country's Shia Muslim minority.Prior to last week, the last major attack in the world's most populous Muslim nation was the twin bombing of luxury hotels in Jakarta in 2009.Ade Irma in Jakarta contributed to this

According to Reuters, at least seven national guard soldiers were injured.Local police downed a drone that attacked the scene where officials, including Maduro, were present.According to Venezuela's Minister of Information, not one, but several, drones allegedly fitted with explosives attacked the country's leadership during a military parade.Meanwhile, local media outlets report that some explosive-carrying drones failed to reach their targets, crashing in a residential area in the center of Caracas, causing fire and large plumes of smoke.#Venezuela Fire in a building in #Caracas, possibly after the drone that aimed to kill Maduro crashed pic.twitter.com/nDzNVnwJ78 \u2014 Guy Elster (@guyelster) 4 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 2018 \u0433.The Venezuelan leader as well as the rest of the political and military leadership of the Latin American country feel fine and were not injured during the attack, according to the president of a state-owned bank Miguel Perez Abad.\"Soon, our national government will inform about what happened on the Bolivar avenue \u2026 Our President Nicolas Maduro feels fine as well as the supreme political and military command of the revolution,\" Perez Abad wrote on Twitter.Venezuela has been recently mired a political and socioeconomic crisis, which many blame on dropping oil prices as well as the leadership\u2019s decisions. The nation experienced months of mass protests last year, which initially were a response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to severely limit the parliament's legislative powers.The protests in Venezuela were further fueled by the election of a new lawmaking body, known as the Constituent Assembly, initiated by Maduro with the aim of rewriting the constitution.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle downed <extra_id_0> Artifact drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamagerDestroyer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Crash crashing <extra_id_0> Vehicle drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Crash crashed <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact address <extra_id_0> Communicator Nicolas Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact speech <extra_id_0> Communicator Nicolas Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact delivering <extra_id_0> Communicator Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation evacuated <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacked <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacked <extra_id_0> Instrument drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target country's leadership <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protests  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protests <extra_id_0> Topic the Constituent Assembly <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Analysis backs claim drones were used to attack Venezuela\u2019s presidentAnalysis of open source information carried out by the investigative website Bellingcat suggests drones that had been repurposed as flying bombs were indeed used in an attack on the president of Venezuela this weekend.The Venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro using two drones loaded with explosives.The president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred.Initial video from a state-owned television network showed the reaction of Maduro, those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera.But the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions.AP also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim \u2014 suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat.Since then more footage has emerged, including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building.Bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack, including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro\u2019s speech, and using frame-by-frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up.The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s, each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and, when detonated, capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters.DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model, normally used for industrial work \u2014 with a U.S. price tag of around $5,000 apiece, suggesting the attack could have cost little over $10k to carry out \u2014 with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially (for demolition purposes) at a cost of around $30.Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government\u2019s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600, noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors.It also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model, although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed.Venezuela\u2019s interior minister, Nestor Reverol, also claimed the government thwarted the attack using \"special techniques and [radio] signal inhibitors\", which \"disoriented\" the drone that detonated closest to the presidential stand \u2014 a capability Bellingcat notes the Venezuelan security services are reported to have.The second drone was said by Reverol to have \"lost control\" and crashed into a nearby building.Bellingcat says it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion.It adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed.\"It is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated, creating the hole in the wall of this apartment, igniting a fire, and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in Video 2 [of the state TV broadcast of Maduro\u2019s speech],\" it further suggests.Here\u2019s its conclusion:From the open sources of information available, it appears that an attack took place using two DBIEDs while Maduro was giving a speech.Both the drones appear visually similar to DJI Matrice 600s, with at least one displaying features that are consistent with this model.These drones appear to have been loaded with explosive and flown towards the parade.The first drone detonated somewhere above or near the parade, the most likely cause of the casualties announced by the Venezuelan government and pictured on social media.The second drone crashed and exploded approximately 14 seconds later and 400 meters away from the stage, and is the most likely cause of the fire which the Venezuelan firefighters described.It also considers the claim of attribution by a group on social media, calling itself \"Soldados de Franelas\" (aka \u2018T-Shirt Soldiers\u2019 \u2014 a reference to a technique used by protestors wrapping a t-shirt around their head to cover their face and protect their identity), suggesting it\u2019s not clear from the group\u2019s Twitter messages that they are \"unequivocally claiming responsibility for the event\", owing to use of passive language, and to a claim that the drones were shot down by government snipers \u2014 which it says \"does not appear to be supported by the open source information available\".", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument drones

Three people died-one a mother of seven, another a boy of 14.News Headlines on the Day The three year bloodbath in Ulster reached a new level of savagery when terrorists unleashed a -killer blitz of stunning ferocity. This city has not experienced such a day of death and destruction since the German blitz of 1941. With the callous lack of remorse now so typical of the Provos they audaciously accept responsibility for what was an operation clearly requiring considerable planning and manpower. Throughout the 32 counties Irish men and women should ponder how a virulent Nazi-style disregard for life can lodge In the hearts of our fellow countrymen; all the more virulent in that once again the Innocent have been the main sufferers. Hitler In his Berlin bunker decided that the German people were no longer worthy of him and deserved not to survive. Yesterday's dead and injured and testimony to something similarly rotten in our philosophy of life. Every Irishman and woman must stand appalled and ashamed at the horror of what was perpetuated In Belfast yesterday In the name of Irish unity. Belfast is rocked and racked by the most ferocious blitz yet mounted by the IRA. Not even the German bombs could inflict more devastation on the capital of Ulster in the last war. On this unforgettable day 26 bombs, borne by car and planted to take the greatest toll of life, shattered the bodies of men, women and children in a fiendish holocaust of murder and hate. The wanton killing of non-combatant men, women and children-the inevitable consequence of exploding so many bombs without adequate warning - is yet another cruel act which will not be forgotten.A wanton attack on innocent men,women and childrenTHE FOLLOWING STATEMENT WAS MADE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND, MR. WILLIAM WHITELAW, IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, 24 JULY 1972:- As the House will know, the City and people of Belfast suffered a murderous sequence of explosions last Friday. Most of the 27 explosions in Belfast that day occurred within a 3\u00bd hour period in the afternoon-at a time when, and at places where high civilian casualties must have been expected and intended. No adequate warnings were given. Seven civilians and two soldiers were killed and at least 130 civilians injured-many gravely. I hardly need point out that all sections of the community are indiscriminately affected by these outrages. Of the dead two were Roman Catholics. Of the 130 injured at least 40 were Roman Catholics. 53 were men and boys, 77 women and children. I am sure the whole House will wish to join with me in expressing sympathy to the families of all those involved in this wanton attack on innocent men, women and children. After the appallingly bloodthirsty and criminal events of last Friday, there cannot be any remaining shred of support for the men who perpetrate them. Even those sectors of Roman Catholic opinion throughout the world which have traditionally identified themselves with and perhaps given the benefit of the doubt to any group of men who claimed to speak for the Irish Republican movement can surely no longer continue to uphold the men who were responsible for Friday's horrible catalogue of slaughter. Supporters of the Republican movement in this country, in Northern Ireland, in the United States and elsewhere, will no doubt notice the revulsion in some circles in the Irish Republic. Since Parliament at the end of March entrusted the Government with complete responsibility for all administration in Northern Ireland, we have made the most patient and reasoned effort to secure the end of violence. No one can deny that Her Majesty's Government have now an absolutely unchallengeable right to ask this House, this country, and indeed the whole world for their support in an absolute determination to destroy the capacity of the IRA for further acts of inhumanity. They have degraded the human race, and it must now be clear to all that their sole object is to promote their aims by violence and by violence alone.DESTRUCTION In Oxford Street bus station where death came to six people and scores were injured. The station was crowded when the bomb exploded. It was the worst of the afternoon's 19 murderous bombings.DESTRUCTION at Smithfield bus station, scene of the first of the vicious series of attacks on innocent people. Mercifully the buses here seen ablaze had not started filling up with passengers.DESTRUCTION in York Road railway terminus where the bomb was in an innocent-looking suitcase left on the platform.Letters to the Editor Funeral with no shouted commandsbut only sobs of four small childrenTO-DAY (Monday) I went to a funeral-that of one of \"Bloody Friday's\" victims. It wasn't one of those funerals we know so well in Belfast, with the uniformed men, the ceremonial shots, the shouted commands, the graveside oration. The only uniforms were the black and white vestments of the clergy. The only arms were those of Christ crucified on the Cross which led the Cortege. No shouted commands- only the sobbing of four small children. No graveside oration, only the tears in the eyes of a husband as final tribute. If there is power in the sobs of children and the tears of husbands and fathers, wives and mothers then the cause espoused by the terrorist is on the point of death: its followers now are but walking. dead, animated husks, soulless and mindless. rejected and disowned by any creature capable of pity and compassion. The earth which thudded on that coffin covered only a body, not the bestial deed which sent it there, an ever-pointing finger of condemnation to all involved - the terrorists who planned the bombing campaign, the terrorists who made the bombs, the terrorists who planted them: the politicians who wouldn't talk until all their demands were met and the politicians who talked too much and too often said the wrong thing; the leading churchmen, who merely mouthed pious attitudes. condemning violence in general but never aiming at specific deeds and organisations: The trade unionists who permitted discrimination to be the unwritten rule in our industrial life and the industrialists and businessmen who bowed to this evil on their premises; the neighbours, who were true neighbours and friends-until intimidation entered their street. To-day's victim had the dignity and honour of innocence and motherhood to take to her grave and Maker, and leaves her legacy of a peace-loving, and In the course of time, happy family. Her killers will face their Maker with her blood and many others on their hands and can only leave a. their legacy hatred, sorrow and despair.A FACE IN THE CROWD,Belfast 13.DESTRUCTION In Botanic Avenue after a bomb exploded in a hi-jacked bread van parked outside the York Hotel. Cars and houses suffered in the blast and there were the inevitable casualties.DESTRUCTION at the busy Antrim Road-Limeston Road corner. The wreckage in the forefront is all that was left of the stolen van in which the bomb had been planted. Women shoppers were among the casualties.DESTRUCTION at the shopping centre on the Cavehill Road, where one of the last of the bombs killed three people, including a mother of seven and a boy of 14.REPORTS 'Streets swept by terror' \"Such warnings as were given were so vague and imprecise as to be almost useless; For much of the afternoon Belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic. Girls and men wept openly, hugging each other for safety in the main streets as plumes of smoke rose around them and dull thuds echoed from wall to wall. It was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe As each bomb exploded there were cries of terror from people who thought they had found sanctuary but in fact were just as exposed as before. Report in the Guardian.'A day of horror and shame' Friday, July 21, 1972, was a day of horror and shame in this stricken city. Even hardened newsmen recoiled with shock from the scenes of carnage witnessed in Belfast as firemen lifted the mangled bodies where bombs ripped through crowds of unsuspecting men, women and children at bus depots and other locations. In all my years of journalism, which included the worst days of the wartime blitzes, I have never seen scenes so horrible in this city and one felt a deep feeling of anger and shame that such deeds were planned and carried out by fellow Irishmen. All Ireland has been shamed by the events of this terrible July afternoon in Belfast. Report in the Irish Independent, Dublin.'A deed of sick men' \"The chief injury is not to the British Army, to the Establishment or to big business but to the plain people of Belfast and Ireland. Anyone who supports violence from any s i d e after yesterday's events is sick with the same affliction as those who did the deed. \"Can anyone now believe that anything worth while can be established by these methods? That the country of anyone's vision can live with more memories of this kind?\" \"Irish Times\", Dublin. 'The cold-blooded, co-ordinated bomb outrages are a shocking crime against an already innocent population who have already suffered too much. These were brutal murders which will be totally condemned by every decent person in the United Kingdom.'Mr. Harold Wilson, Leader of the OppositionTHE BOMBERS STRIKE - AND THIS IS SOME OF THE SUFFERING THEY LEFTScenes of anguish in Oxford Street Bus Station where six people died - as pictured in the Daily Express \"A black sin ... that will never be erased\" By the Editor of theSunday IndependentDublin These are dark days for Ireland. We live in an age of cowardice, with the guilt spread evenly between the highest and the lowest in the land. We fostered the men who planned the murders of innocent men, women, boys and girls in Belfast on Friday. We fed these people with propaganda. We took advantage, when we could, of their exploits. And because we are not a morally courageous people, we never seriously tried to stop their terrible excesses. Those among us who could have acted to halt the course of tragedy preferred to do nothing. Those who could have spoken out, when words might have meant something, chose to hold their tongues. And the rest of us were content to let matters slide. Now all of us must pay the price for this neglect. There is a black sin on the face of Irish Republicanism today that will never be erased. Murder now lies at the feet of the Irish nation and there is no gain-saying that fact. We cannot change past, however much we regret its record. But if we wish to restore the honour of our people, now is the time to act. We must break the paralysis that leaves the good name of the Irish people in the hands of unscrupulous men. And we must find a way to make restitution for our failings. The gallantry of those who planted bombs in the middle of Belfast's shopping areas on Friday (and then ran like hell) will be sanctified by the almighty god of Irish republicanism and reverently embalmed- in what we are pleased to call our national heritage. We won't have a ballad to commemorate the butchered fragments of a woman we saw on the telly being shovelled up by a fireman. Who said Dan Breen is dead? His spirit is alive and well and looking forward to a cosy corner in whatever parliamentary system we are going to have for the next 50 years.
