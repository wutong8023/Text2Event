{"text": "On 17 January 2019, a vehicle was driven into the General Santander National Police Academy in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The truck forced its way into the facility, hit a wall and detonated, killing 22 people (including the perpetrator) and injuring 68 others. Suicide attacks are unusual in Colombia. The car contained about  of pentolite. It was the deadliest attack on the Colombian capital since the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing and the first terrorist attack on the capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing. The National Liberation Army (ELN) accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the Colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire.==Background===== Colombian conflict ===The Colombian conflict started in 1964, although systematic violence in the country can be dated since the end of the 19th century (Thousand Days' War). The National Liberation Army (ELN) is one of the most prominent participants of the ongoing conflict. For decades, residents of Bogot\u00e1 lived in fear of being a victim of a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar's Medell\u00edn drug cartel. But as Colombia's conflict has wound down, and the nation's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.Sporadic attacks have affected the city since the peace deal was initiated. The most prominent was an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 which killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary's Movement for the bombing.=== Peace dialogue ===The 2016 peace deal between the FARC and Colombian government resulted in the ELN gaining strength in the region. The Colombian government has attempted to establish peace dialogue with the ELN since 2017, though ELN groups have rejected conditions placed by the government, such as the end of criminal actions including violent attacks and kidnappings. The ELN, however, persisted that the Colombian government should continue dialogue without making any demands towards the group. Between 2017 and up until the attack, Colombian officials stated that the ELN had participated in at least 400 terrorist attacks in the nation since dialogue began, including the shoot down of a civilian helicopter and the kidnapping of its occupants.=== ELN in Venezuela ===According to InSight Crime, the ELN and FARC dissidents allegedly met together in Venezuela to form a potential alliance in October 2018. Sources based in the Arauca department in Colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. It was also alleged that former FARC commander Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez participated in the talks with the ELN.In November 2018, InSight Crime also reported that the ELN was present in over twelve Venezuelan states, spanning from the Colombia-Venezuela border in the west across Venezuela and into Brazil and Guyana to the east. Insight Crime states that Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was tolerant of the ELN, explaining that \"ELN\u2019s expansion in Venezuela has been marked by the Maduro administration\u2019s inaction and even encouragement towards the group\", with reports from Venezuelan NGO Fundaci\u00f3n Redes that the Venezuelan military had possibly armed ELN members.==Events===== Planning ===Attorney General  identified the perpetrator as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, known as \"Mocho Kiko\" because of his missing hand due to a previous explosion, a 57-year-old from the northern department of Boyac\u00e1. Rojas is alleged to have been involved with the ELN for three decades and served as an intelligence chief for a branch of the group. Since 2011, Rojas is alleged to have been teaching guerrilla militants in Venezuela how to construct explosives.Ricardo Carvajal, who was previously investigated for drug trafficking in 2012 but was acquitted of the charges, allegedly contracted Rojas for the bombing due to his experience. The bombing, according to Colombian authorities, had been planned for more than ten months. In May 2018, Colombian records show that Rojas purchased a 1993 Nissan Patrol from Mauricio Mosquera, who was previously charged with terrorism and rebellion. On 27 July 2018, the vehicle was officially inspected in Arauca, Arauca, a city found on the border of Colombia and Venezuela where the ELN mainly controls territory.=== Attack ===The authorities stated that on 17 January 2019 at 9:30am, Rojas drove his grey 1993 Nissan Patrol loaded with  of pentolite to the campus of the General Santander National Police Academy and dropped off a passenger at a nearby bus stop. Rojas then reportedly drove his truck down a side street used for deliveries to make his way onto the campus. When a detection dog signaled explosives on the vehicle, the driver forced his vehicle through a security checkpoint and struck security guards. The explosives in the truck were then detonated near the women's dormitories at the police academy as students were leaving a promotion ceremony. It is unknown if the driver detonated the explosives or if it was possibly the individual he left near the bus stop who remotely triggered the device.In the immediate aftermath, the authorities began investigating Rojas's possible connections to either the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla movement, the Clan \u00dasuga organized crime gang, or FARC dissidents.=== Initial investigations ===On 18 January, Defence Minister  identified Rojas Rodr\u00edguez as a long-time member of the ELN, within which he served as an explosives expert. Investigators were able to identify Rojas with security camera footage and fingerprints from his remaining hand.A second individual, who Attorney General Mart\u00ednez said \"had participated in the attack\", was arrested in Bogot\u00e1 at 2:30am on the day following the attack.  The individual was identified as Ricardo Carvajal after he allegedly confessed to the bombings over a telephone call investigators intercepted. He was found with a \"combatant's manual\" and numerous coveralls. Carvajal Salgar denied that he was involved in the attack and his family stated that the coveralls were used for the jobs he worked.According to Colombian authorities, there are on-going operations throughout Bogot\u00e1 and the department of Arauca to capture other individuals suspected of having been involved in the attack, and that the ELN was responsible despite the organization not taking claim for the attack as it has done in the past.=== Peace dialogue ends ===President Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez announced on 18 January that peace dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the ELN was officially suspended. Duque also demanded that Cuba extradite the ten ELN leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their Interpol Red Notices, and he criticized Venezuela for providing refuge for the ELN on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In response to the request, Cuba's Foreign Minister announced that Cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties.The President of the National Constituent Assembly of Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello, denied any Venezuelan involvement in the attacks on 18 January. On 21 January, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called for a \"concrete response\" from the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela on whether the ELN was present in Venezuela, explaining that prior to the attack, the Colombian government asked the Venezuelan government on the potential presence of ELN groups in Venezuela without a response. Holmes Trujillo also stated that the Maduro government had taken \"evasive positions\" when speaking about the ELN.===Claim of responsibility===ELN accepted the responsibility for the attack, saying the bombing was carried out in retaliation for the Colombian government not honoring the ceasefire by carrying out attacks on its camps. It justified that government and the cadres of its security forces had therefore become legitimate targets and called for resuming peace dialogue. High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos spoke out against its members being sheltered anymore now that it had claimed responsibility.==International reactions==A foreign national, identified as a female cadet from Ecuador, was killed in the attack, while three nationals from Panama, one from the United States and another also from Ecuador were wounded. Their respective governments have expressed their condemnation for the attack and assistance to their citizens.* Cuba: Cuba shared condolences with Colombia, with its foreign ministry stating Cuba \"will act with strict respect for the Protocols of Dialogue and Peace signed by the Government and the ELN, including the Protocol in Case of a Rupture in Negotiations\".* Ecuador: President Len\u00edn Moreno lamented the death of Erika Chic\u00f3, the Ecuadorian cadet killed in the attack, and expressed his condolences to Colombia. He also announced that he was to send Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner to Bogot\u00e1 accompanied by Chic\u00f3's relatives.* Panama: The Panamanian embassy in Bogot\u00e1 expressed its indignation at the attack, and provided a phone number for information about Panamanian cadets affected.* United States: The Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Kimberly Breier condemned the bombing and said: \"Our condolences and sympathies go to the victims and family members of those killed\", while the U.S. Embassy in Bogot\u00e1 offered its \"help in investigating this reprehensible attack\".Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and the Organization of American States also condemned the attack.==References==", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Transportation driven

{"text": "Suspected New York Bomber Wounded in Shootout with PoliceThe suspect in Saturday night's bombing in New York City that wounded 29 people is in a hospital recovering from bullet wounds after a shootout with police.Prosecutors have charged 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami with five counts of attempted murder stemming from the shootout that wounded two officers.Police arrested Rahami in Linden, New Jersey \u2014 outside Manhattan \u2014 hours after police sent out a city-wide bulletin with his picture, saying he was wanted for questioning.A bar owner in Linden called police Monday morning to complain that a man was sleeping in a doorway of his business. Officers recognized the man as Rahami, who opened fire, wounding two policemen before he was injured.None of the wounds are considered life-threatening.Police officers walk near the site where Ahmad Khan Rahami, sought in connection with a bombing in New York, was taken into custody in Linden, New Jersey, U.S., Sept. 19, 2016.The FBI is not saying how they zeroed in on Rahami as the bombing suspect. But investigators reportedly saw him on surveillance video at the bomb site in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, and near a second bomb allegedly left several blocks away. The second explosive was found before it could detonate.Investigators also reportedly found fingerprints on a bomb fragment.Video sizewidthxheightpixelsFollowing Terror Suspect Capture, New York Remains VigilantShare this video0:02:12\u25b60:00:00/0:02:12\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 6.3MB360p | 9.9MB720p | 56.3MBOther bombsThe FBI wants to question Rahami about another bombing Saturday morning in Seaside Park, New Jersey, south of New York, that forced the cancellation of a charity road race. No one was injured.Other bombs were found in a garbage can at a train station Sunday morning in Elizabeth, New Jersey. One of the bombs exploded while a robot was trying to disarm it. Again, no one was hurt.FILE - Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials label and collect evidence near the site of an explosion which took place on Saturday night in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, Sept. 18, 2016.Rahami's alleged motive for the bombings is unknown.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Rahami is the only suspect so far. The mayor on Monday said there is every reason to believe the bombings were acts of terrorism, and the FBI is looking for any links to foreign terror groups.Obama: We have to be vigilantSpeaking in New York, President Barack Obama said the investigation is moving rapidly and that everyone is working together to get to the bottom of what happened. He said terrorists and extremists want to hurt innocent people, inspire fear and disrupt life.President Barack Obama speaks about last Saturday's bombing in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood in New York, Sept. 19, 2016.\"We have to be vigilant and aggressive, both on preventing senseless acts of violence but also making sure that we find those who carry out such acts and bring them to justice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don't succumb to that fear.\"One New Yorker told VOA that the bombing was unsettling, but not surprising.\"There is a security to this city. Sure there are days where I have my doubts about that, but because I do feel this camaraderie in the city, I do feel relatively safe.\"Suspect called friendlySuspected bomber Rahami was born in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He and his family run a fried-chicken restaurant in Linden that has a steady number of loyal customers. But it also had trouble with the city of Linden for what neighbors said was round-the-clock noise and crowds at the eatery.Some of the restaurant's customers say they are shocked that Rahami is a suspect, calling him friendly. They say he let local bands practice in the back of the restaurant, and gave them free food.New York City Afghan community leader Masjid Dar al Taqwa condemned the bombings.\"Everyone ... is shocked and saddened by what has happened,\" he told VOA. \"They condemn all forms of violence.

{"text": "Opposition decries election of new constituent assembly made up of Socialist party and allies after claims eight million people voted were proved wrongThis article is more than 3 years oldThis article is more than 3 years oldVenezuela\u2019s opposition has announced plans to block the inauguration of a contentious constituent assembly whose election was further clouded on Wednesday by fresh allegations of ballot fraud.The opposition coalition called for mass protests \u201cagainst the installation of the constituent fraud\u201d to prevent the new assembly \u2013 made up entirely by the ruling Socialist party and its political allies \u2013 from beginning its sessions on Thursday.Venezuela poll turnout figures \u2018manipulated by at least 1m votes\u2019 Read moreAs many as 40 countries have said they would not recognize the new assembly, which critics say is a thinly veiled attempt by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to consolidate power. The body will have the ability to dissolve state institutions and rewrite the constitution.Maduro has said his aim is to bring peace to the sharply split country caught up in political crisis and economic meltdown.But the president and his closest allies have also vowed to use the assembly to jail key opposition leaders, remove the country\u2019s outspoken chief prosecutor from her post and strip opposition legislators of their constitutional immunity.\u201cThe constituent assembly is the change so that this country can regain order. Anarchy is over, here,\u201d said Cilia Flores, Maduro\u2019s wife on receiving her accreditation as a member of the assembly. \u201cJustice will come starting tomorrow,\u201d she said.New doubts were cast on the official turnout for the assembly vote, after the company that provides the technological platform for Venezuela\u2019s voting system said on Wednesday that the government\u2019s claim that more than 8 million people voted on Sunday were wrong.\u201cWe know, without any doubt, that the turnout of the recent election for a national constituent assembly was manipulated,\u201d Antonio Mugica, the chief executive of Smartmatic, said in London.Mugica said Smartmatic detected the overstated turnout because of Venezuela\u2019s automated election system. \u201cWe estimate the difference between the actual participation and the one announced by authorities is at least 1m votes,\u201d he said.The electoral council president, Tibisay Lucena, put the turnout at 41.53%, or 8,089,320 people. The opposition put the number at between 2 million and 3 million.Only 3.7 million people had voted by 5.30pm in the constituent assembly election, according to internal electoral council data reviewed by Reuters, casting doubt on the 8.1 million people authorities said had voted that day. Voting lasted until 7pm.Lucena dismissed Mugica\u2019s allegations, calling it an \u201copinion\u201d of a company that played only a secondary role in the election and had no access to complete data. \u201cA company located outside the country does not guarantee the transparency and credibility of the Venezuelan electoral system,\u201d she said.Andr\u00e9s Izarra, a former information minister under Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, tweeted: \u201cCompany which supports Venezuelan electoral system confirms that election was manipulated by at least a million votes.\u201dAndr\u00e9s Izarra (@IzarraDeVerdad) Empresa que soporta sistema electoral vzlano confirma que elecci\u00f3n fue manipulada en al menos un mill\u00f3n de votos https://t.co/6Vn96SJi97His tweet \u2013 a rare display of criticism from a veteran Chavista \u2013 quickly went viral. In a follow-up tweet, Izarra said he recognized there are \u201cdoubts that must be cleared up about the results of Sunday\u2019s election\u201d but warned the opposition that he had not become one of them. \u201cSquallid ones, don\u2019t count on me EVER,\u201d he tweeted.Julio Borges, the leader of the opposition-held parliament, said voter fraud was \u201cthe most serious crime that can be committed against democracy\u201d.Meanwhile international pressure mounted on Maduro as his country and government became increasingly isolated, after two top political opponents under house arrest were dragged from their homes in midnight raids.The EU defied calls for sanctions against Venezuela\u2019s president after Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy proposed the member countries block travel by anyone linked to Maduro\u2019s government. However, the bloc warned that it was ready to action if there was any further dilution of the country\u2019s democratic institutions.Federica Mogherini, the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs, said in a statement that the union would not recognise the new constituent assembly due to \u201cconcerns over its effective representativeness and legitimacy\u201d. She failed, however, to act on calls from the European parliament\u2019s president, Antonio Tajani, for targeted sanctions against Maduro.Venezuela: Maduro condemned after opposition duo arrested in midnight raids Read more\u201cThe effective installation of the constituent assembly should be suspended and the attributions of all institutions foreseen by the constitution should be explicitly recognised,\u201d she said.Mogherini added a call for all parties to \u201cnegotiate a way forward\u201d.

{"text": "Venezuela\u2019s beleaguered government appeared prepared to go ahead with a vote on Sunday that critics at home and abroad have warned will seal the demise of the oil-rich nation\u2019s democracy.At least five people were killed last week after the opposition stepped up its protests against the controversial vote that will elect a 545-member constituent assembly with the power to rewrite the constitution and dissolve state institutions.A government ban on public demonstrations in the run-up to the election reduced turnouts for nationwide protests called by the opposition, but sporadic looting and clashes between protesters manning barricades of tree branches and barbed wire were reported in several cities on Friday night.Q&A Why is there unrest in Venezuela? Show \u2022 At the heart of the crisis is a cratering economy and acute shortages of medicine and food, coupled with rising anger at a soaring crime rate and an increasingly authoritarian government \u2022 The president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, won a general election in 2013 on a platform of continuing his predecessor Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's socialist policies of using the country's oil riches to reduce inequality and lift people out of poverty, but falling oil prices have forced the government to curtail social programmes \u2022 Opposition activists have been staging unrelenting protests against the government.Despite the continuing threat of repression, the opposition coalition, known as MUD, called for mass demonstrations in Caracas on Sunday while voting takes place.\u201cTomorrow we rebel,\u201d tweeted Freddy Guevara, vice-president of the opposition-held national legislature, whose power to legislate was hamstrung by a supreme court decision in April, prompting the protests.At least 113 people have been killed, and more than 2,000 wounded, in constant street protests since April, triggering President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s decision to create the assembly.Maduro has said the assembly will help bring peace to the sharply divided country where, despite its oil wealth, many Venezuelans are going hungry because of food shortages and spiralling inflation. But the opposition said it is little more than a power grab to consolidate the ruling socialist party\u2019s grip. It is boycotting the assembly and demanding general elections instead.\u201cOn 30 July, the constitutional assembly will happen,\u201d Maduro said. \u201cI\u2019ve been loyal to Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s legacy. Now it\u2019s your turn.\u201dAn attempt at brokering an agreement by the former prime minister of Spain, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to avert the increased tensions appeared to have failed. Zapatero issued a statement on Saturday tacitly acknowledging that the constituent assembly vote would be held, but calling on the assembly\u2019s powers to be limited and for firm dates for local and presidential elections to be set.\u201cToday and tomorrow are transcendental for Venezuela,\u201d Zapatero said in the statement. He called on the government to make \u201cnew gestures\u201d to help ease tensions but did not call for the vote to be cancelled.The opposition also appeared resigned to seeing the vote take place. \u201cBut we are not backing down because our problem is not the constituent assembly, it is the dictatorship,\u201d said Guevara in a statement.\u201cWhat comes after Sunday will not be easy for us,\u201d he said, adding however that the \u201cdeepening of the crisis will affect those in government much more\u201d.But polls show that 70% of Venezuelans do not want a constituent assembly, although turnout on Sunday may not reflect that. To avoid an embarrassingly low turnout, government officials and pro-government neighbourhood committees have been warning that people who do not show up for the vote may lose their jobs, essential food subsidies or homes.Delcy Leonor Medina, a 52-year-old housekeeper, said she and her neighbours in a working-class district of Caracas face the threat of armed muggings and murders.Now they face an added threat of losing their government-subsidised homes if they don\u2019t vote. But she remained defiant. \u201cI\u2019m not giving that bastard anything. If the constituent assembly is voted in, I may have to leave here,\u201d she said.Many of Venezuela\u2019s 2.8 million state workers have reported getting text messages, phone calls and being required to attend political rallies during work hours, according to Reuters.Early on Saturday, the opposition coalition\u2019s website appeared to have been hacked, showing a message saying \u201cYanquis, leave our America\u201d with a photo of the US president, Donald Trump. Hours later, the site showed a message reading \u201cDemocracy cannot be hacked.\u201dCilia Flores, Maduro\u2019s wife and a candidate for the assembly, said the new body with supra-legislative powers would create a commission to punish those responsible for the political upheaval. They will \u201cpay and learn their lesson\u201d, she said, playing on the fears of the opposition that they will suffer further persecution.Diosdado Cabello, the first vice-president of Venezuela\u2019s socialist party, said the assembly will strip legislators in the opposition-controlled National Assembly of their immunity from prosecution. He said the office of Venezuela\u2019s chief prosecutor, who recently became one of Maduro\u2019s most outspoken critics, would be \u201cturned upside down\u201d.The US has led other nations in imposing targeted sanctions against 13 current and former officials close to the government. They were followed by similar measures by Mexico and Colombia.US vice-president Mike Pence spoke by phone with opposition leader and political prisoner Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, sentenced to 14 years for inciting violence, charges human rights groups have said were trumped up. Pence told L\u00f3pez, who was transferred to house arrest earlier this month, that the United States \u201cstands with the Venezuelan people\u201d.The Trump administration has threatened further measures if the vote goes ahead, which may target the country\u2019s oil industry, one of the few economic lifelines left in Venezuela.Colombia\u2019s president Juan Manuel Santos, who is often the target of Maduro\u2019s public rants of an international conspiracy against him, said he would not recognise the constituent assembly, which he called \u201cspurious\u201d.In a tacit recognition of the growing humanitarian and political crisis, the Colombian government said on Friday it was granting a special permit for Venezuelans already in the country to remain for up to two years.And more than one Venezuelan is preparing to pack his bags and join the growing number of people fleeing.Carlos, a 24-year-old student at the Metropolitan University in Caracas, said most of his friends are leaving the country. His parents have said that if the constituent assembly is voted in, they want him to join them. \u201cI would lose my family, my home, my friends, my university,\u201d said Carlos, who declined to give his real name. But he also holds another fear. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of losing my country,\u201d he said.Additional reporting by Ana Sofia Romero in Caracas.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate demonstrations  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protests <extra_id_0> Demonstrator the opposition <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate clashes <extra_id_0> Demonstrator protesters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protests <extra_id_0> Target the government <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrator Opposition <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce threat  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate demonstrations <extra_id_0> Demonstrator the opposition <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim 113 people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim 2,000 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protests  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact statement <extra_id_0> Communicator Zapatero <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact statement <extra_id_0> Communicator Guevara <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce threat <extra_id_0> Recipient Delcy Leonor Medina <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce threat <extra_id_0> Recipient they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentenced <extra_id_0> Defendant Leopoldo L\u00f3pez <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee L\u00f3pez <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce threatened <extra_id_0> Communicator administration <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Venezuela <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Diosdado Cabello <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Carlos <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Carlos <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "July 29, 2011 \u0097 -- When Army Pfc. Naser Jason Abdo, accused of plotting planning a deadly bombing and shooting attack on soldiers at Fort Hood, made his first appearance in court in Waco, Texas, today, he yelled the name of accused Fort Hood shooter Major Nidal Hasan.Hasan is facing the death penalty for allegedly killing 13 people and wounding more than 30 in an assault on Fort Hood in November 2009.Like Hasan, Abdo may have taken some of his inspiration from Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical American-born Islamic cleric who is among the leaders of the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). One senior U.S. official told ABC News that after Abdo was arrested at a Killeen, Texas hotel Wednesday, Abdo mentioned the name of al-Awlaki.Nidal Hasan had exchanged emails with Awlaki, according to U.S. authorities. Al-Awlaki is believed to have inspired several other terror plots in the U.S. as well, including the bungled Christmas Day underwear bombing of Northwest flight 253.According to senior law enforcement officials, when police searched Abdo's hotel room, in addition to firearms, ammunition and bomb-making materials, they also found an article from a jihadi magazine produced by al-Awlaki's organization, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.The officials told ABC News Abdo had apparently stashed in the room an article from the first issue of al Qaeda's \"Inspire\" magazine called \"How to Build a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.\"AQAP, a media-savvy affiliate of al Qaeda, has produced six issues of \"Inspire\" so far, each featuring praise for martyrs and instructional sections on firearms and explosives for the prospective terrorist.Abdo was charged Friday with the federal crime of possession of a non-registered firearm in addition to previous charges of possession of child pornography and going AWOL from his unit. As he was being led from the courtroom, he yelled out, \"Nidal Hasan!\", \"Fort Hood!\", and \"2009!\".READ: Soldier Arrested in Alleged Fort Hood PlotAbdo Went AWOL July 4Abdo, a Muslim soldier who was in the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell more than 800 miles away in Kentucky, attempted to leave the military in 2010 after protesting the U.S.'s involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.In August 2010 he told ABC News he should not have to participate in what he called an \"unjust war\".\"Any Muslim who knows his religion or maybe takes into account what his religion says can find out very clearly why he should not participate in the U.S. military,\" Abdo said then.READ: Devout Muslim Hopes to Avoid Deployment to AfghanistanThe Army approved Abdo's request to be discharged as a conscientious objector, but just days later the discharge was put on hold and he was charged with having child pornography on his government-issued computer. Military investigators had been looking at Abdo's computer files after he made \"radical statements,\" law enforcement sources told ABC News.After he was told he would face a court martial, Abdo went AWOL from Fort Campbell on July 4. Though vocal in his protestations against the mission in the Middle East, Abdo did not make any public threats against the military.But when he was discovered Wednesday, Abdo was apparently in the final planning stages of a deadly attack. He was caught in part because a wary local gun store owner called police after Abdo visited the store to buy ammunition and gunpowder. He was acting \"suspicious,\" Guns Galore owner Greg Ebert told ABC News.\"There was clearly something wrong with him,\" Ebert said. \"We made a decision to call the police and fortunately it worked out.\"After his arrest, Abdo admitted he planned to plant two bombs at a local restaurant frequented by Fort Hood soldiers and hoped to gun down any survivors of the dual blast, according to law enforcement documents obtained by ABC News.According to the documents, military officials believe the incident \"was likely isolated to the Fort Hood area and the suspect in custody, and that arrest of the suspect has mitigated any further threats related to this incident.\"Abdo's former lawyer, James M. Branum, declined to comment for an ABC News report except to say Thursday he hasn't spoken with his client \"in a long time.\"ABC News' Sarah Netter, Luis Martinez and Lee Ferran contributed to this report.Click Here for the Blotter Homepage.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker Naser Jason Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Fort Hood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact emails <extra_id_0> Participant Nidal Hasan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection searched <extra_id_0> Observer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place room <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation led <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin courtroom <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain Arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Soldier <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Fort Hood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation Went <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation Deployment <extra_id_0> Destination Afghanistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Muslim <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> EndPosition discharged <extra_id_0> Employee Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PlaceOfEmployment Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection looking <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Observer investigators <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict face <extra_id_0> Defendant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation went <extra_id_0> Transporter Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin Fort Campbell <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact protestations <extra_id_0> Communicator his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce threats <extra_id_0> Communicator Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient military <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell buy <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity gunpowder <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Giver Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact called <extra_id_0> Participant owner <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant Greg Ebert <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact call <extra_id_0> Participant We <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact say <extra_id_0> Participant ABC News <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact spoken <extra_id_0> Participant client <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place hotel <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant ABC News <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target flight 253 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument underwear <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime possession  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime AWOL <extra_id_0> Perpetrator his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime pornography <extra_id_0> Victim child <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation going  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact yelled out <extra_id_0> Communicator he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic 2009 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime AWOL <extra_id_0> Perpetrator Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protesting <extra_id_0> Target U.S <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Afghanistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrator Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack war  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> EndPosition discharge  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime pornography <extra_id_0> Perpetrator his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime AWOL <extra_id_0> Perpetrator Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack gun down <extra_id_0> Target survivors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack plant <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place restaurant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain custody <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "In Boston Marathon Bombing Trial, a Search for Justice and Closure CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS \u2014\u00a0Three short paragraphs - hand-written, in Russian, on lined, notebook paper - sat atop a stack of old newspapers next to the television in the newly vacant third floor apartment at 410 Norfolk Street.Federal Bureau of Investigation agents had done the first of two searches of the East Cambridge apartment, rented for more than a decade by an ethnic Chechen family, the Tsarnaevs.FILE - This April 15, 2013, photo shows medical workers aiding injured people at the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon following an explosion.Days earlier, on April 15, 2013, two pressure cookers, packed with nails and ball bearings, exploded near the Boston Marathon finish line, killing three, maiming scores and shattering the celebration of the world\u2019s oldest annual marathon.The Tsarnaevs\u2019 two sons had been implicated: Tamerlan, 26, had been killed during a police shoot-out. Dzhokhar, 19, was in police custody.A friend, who had known the Tsarnaev family for years and was very close to all of them, discovered the paper in the apartment and recognized the handwriting as Tamerlan\u2019s:\"They said: how many small armies had defeated larger armies by the will of Allah. The Prophet called to Allah with the words: give me the perseverance in all my undertakings and the resoluteness to follow the correct path. If Allah will give you support, then no one will defeat you. If he removes this support, then who will help you in place of nothing? Let the devout rely on Allah.\"A scrap of paper, featuring Quranic musings, written in Russian and shared with VOA, was found in the Cambridge apartment by a close family friend and identified by the friend as Tamerlan's handwriting.The writing, shared exclusively with VOA, is a glimpse into the mind of the man considered to be the mastermind of the Boston terrorist attack.Nearly 21 months later, the scars of the bombing - psychological and physical - are deep and raw in the Boston area as survivors, witnesses, Americans and Chechens, from Boston and Grozny, have groped to understand the motivations of the Tsarnaev brothers.VOA has retraced some of the key steps leading up to the bombing, interviewing members of the Chechen \u00e9migr\u00e9 community and others who had close dealings with the Tsarnaev family.The story that emerges is one of a troubled family buffeted by the challenges of adapting to American culture and by the undercurrents of war and radicalism wracking their ethnic homeland.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is seen in this law enforcement bulletin, distributed in the days after the April 15, 2013, bombing.The best hope, however, for understanding what led to April 15, 2013, lies with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, whose trial on 30 terrorism and related charges opens Monday in Boston\u2019s federal court just a few miles from the marathon\u2019s finish line.\u201cThey took the innocence from us, that they did take,\u201d said Jason Rosenberg, a Boston-area lawyer who represents a man once cared for by the Tsarnaev family. \u201cYou think you\u2019re immune from [terrorism], it only happens elsewhere.\u201d\u201cWe think: \u2018they can\u2019t be these beasts, but we all know that a human being \u2026 can be caring and loving to someone else and then be a horrendous person,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can be, and are, one and the same, the same person.\u201d\u2018Why did you do it, Tamerlan, why?\u2019A caring and loving person is what Tamerlan seemed like less than four weeks before the bombs sent panic through runners and spectators lining the few hundred yards along Boston\u2019s Boylston Street leading up to the finish line.Around March 20, Tamerlan, along with his American wife, Katherine, traveled to the outskirts of Manchester, New Hampshire, to visit another Chechen family who had fled the region in the early 2000s: Musa Khadzhimuradov, his wife Madina, and their two children.Among the two dozen or so Chechen families living in Boston and southern New Hampshire, it was common to mark holidays together, to attend one another\u2019s barbecues, to carry on traditions from back in Chechnya. Tamerlan had come, Khadzhimuradov said, to say goodbye to Khadzhimuradov\u2019s mother-in-law, who was returning to Chechnya.Khadzhimuradov, who formerly worked as a bodyguard to Chechen separatist leader Akhmed Zakayev, said he had been in touch with Tamerlan since 2006, when they met at a Chechen holiday celebration in Boston. At 755 Boylston St., just a few steps from the finish line of the Boston Marathon, there is little indication of the carnage of the 2013 bombing, except for a small makeshift memorial tied to a narrow tree.During the March visit, both Khadzhimuradov and his wife Madina recalled, Tamerlan played happily with his young daughter Zahara, and chatted with the Khadzhimuradovs\u2019 own daughter.\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about war or religion, nothing,\u201d Musa Khadzhimuradov told VOA. \u201cHe was happy. Maybe he had a double life or something, but he was playing with his child.\u201d\u201cThe way [Katherine] looked at him, she couldn't take her eyes of him,\u201d Madina said. \u201cTamerlan was chatting, playing with his daughter.\u201d \u201cI see him almost every night in my dreams,\u201d she said. \u201cHe looks just as always: very handsome and calm. I cry and I ask him: \u2018Why did you do it, Tamerlan, why?\u2019 And he answers: \u2018I didn't want to do it here.\u2019\u201dBut according to FBI affidavits, the grand jury indictment and other details made public in media reports, Tamerlan was plotting something destructive.On at least two occasions in the months prior to April 15, Tamerlan had visited a Manchester firing range just a few miles from the Khadzhimuradov apartment to practice shooting. On March 20, Dzhokhar, who was a student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, joined Tamerlan at the range.Carey McLoud, an owner and manager of the Manchester Firing Range Line, refused to answer VOA\u2019s questions about the Tsarnaev brothers.Tamerlan had also traveled to the New Hampshire coastal town of Seabrook to buy fireworks, and gather gunpowder to fuel the pressure cooker bombs. On February 6, at around 7:40 p.m., Tamerlan stopped at Phantom Fireworks and paid $199 cash for a package called \u201cLock and Load,\u201d and took advantage of a \u201cbuy-one-get-one-free deal.\u201d He left with 48 mortars and the equivalent of eight pounds of low explosive powder, according to prosecutors.On Feb. 6, 2013, Tamerlan Tsarnaev traveled to New Hampshire, to buy fireworks, as part of preparations to build pressure cooker bombs.\u201cHe asked \u2018what was the loudest, most powerful firework we had?\u201d store manager April Walton told VOA. \u201cIt\u2019s what 80 percent of our customers ask for.\u201dSometime around April 5, just 10 days before the bombings, Tamerlan went online and ordered electronic components that could be used in making bombs, according to the grand jury indictment. Those components were delivered by mail to the Norfolk Street apartment.In recent years, some members of the Tsarnaev family, including the boys\u2019 mother Zubeidat, had begun openly expressing their Muslim faith. They dressed in traditional conservative clothing and attended prayer services, mainly at the Islamic Society of Boston\u2019s Cambridge mosque four blocks from 410 Norfolk Street. Once a fashionable and flashy dresser, Zubeidat had taken to wearing headscarves, long skirts and long-sleeved dresses and shirts. She reportedly started wearing gloves constantly so as to avoid touching the hands of unrelated males, such as shop clerks or tollbooth workers. The Tsarnaev boys\u2019 sisters, Bella and Ailina, also began wearing headscarves.Outburst at the mosquePrior to November 2012, the Tsarnaevs didn\u2019t stand out among the hundreds who attended prayers regularly, said the Cambridge mosque\u2019s acting imam, Ismail Fenni.That month, a guest speaker gave a sermon about the importance of Muslims accepting public holidays like Thanksgiving. Tamerlan stood up and angrily interrupted the speaker, calling him wrong.Fenni said he and other elders spoke to Tamerlan and reminded him of the mosque rules of behavior and decorum. Tamerlan nodded and said he understood, Fenni recalled.Elders at the Cambridge mosque of the Islamic Society of Boston said the November 2012 outburst by Tamerlan Tsarnaev was the first time anyone really took note of him.Then in January 2013, at the prayer service before the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Tamerlan again stood up and interrupted the sermon, as the guest speaker discussed how Muslims should accept the civil rights leader.\u201cThere was nothing really for us to be worried about with him before his explosive outbursts,\u201d Fenni said. \u201cBefore then, he was just a face in the crowd.\u201dThat first outburst had occurred four months after Tamerlan returned from a trip to Russia\u2019s North Caucasus, where Chechnya is located.Between January and July 2012, Tamerlan spent some of his time in Makhachkala, the capital of the Dagestan region, working with his father Anzor, who had arrived in the region in April. Anzor was newly divorced from Zubeidat, according to the family friend, who asked not to be identified publicly while discussing the Tsarnaev\u2019s family dynamics.Like much of Russia's North Caucasus, Dagestan, shown here in red, has struggled with violence spilling over from neighboring Chechnya.The stated reason for Tamerlan\u2019s trip in January 2012, according to the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, was obtain a Russian passport: Tamerlan held a Kyrgyz passport, the result of his early childhood in Kyrgyzstan, where many Chechens lived after being expelled from their homeland by Stalin in the 1940s.But last year, Irina Gordienko, an investigative reporter for Novaya Gazeta, reported that Tamerlan didn\u2019t actually apply for a passport until the end of June, more than six months after arriving.Gordienko also reported Tamerlan had been in contact with two militants wanted by Russian security agencies. One, a Russian-Canadian named William Plotnikov, was killed by police on July 14, 2012. Within two days, Tamerlan left the region to fly back to the United States.\u201cPeople in Dagestan told me he dressed strangely, his behavior was unusual,\u201d Gordienko said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t very knowledgeable about Islam.\u201dWhere Tamerlan (L) saw some success as a boxer, Dzhokhar (R) captained his high school wrestling team.In the United States, Tamerlan had been a show-off from a young age, always seeking attention, the family friend told VOA. He loved to sing, to play violin and to dance. He was smart academically, but he never seemed focused, the friend said: he talked about being an accountant, but he took only a handful of classes at Bunker Hill Community College.Tamerlan was athletic, as well: he trained at a boxing club in Somerville, next door to Cambridge. His boxing career, nurtured by his father Anzor, hit a high point in February 2010 with a regional trophy. Then it petered out.\u201cHe didn\u2019t seem to know where he was going,\u201d the friend said.Over the years, Tamerlan pulled income from short-term jobs.In 2009, he worked as a driver for a Watertown-based elder care facility that catered to Russian immigrants. He also helped his mother with her work as a home health aide in the Newton home of Donald and Rosemary Larking.Donald Larking was an older man who became so close to Tamerlan that he attended prayer services at the Cambridge mosque, according to Rosenberg, Larking\u2019s lawyer. Larking also had constant discussions with Tamerlan about politics and espoused dark conspiracy theories about the attacks of September 11, 2001.Through Rosenberg, Donald Larking refused to be interviewed for this article.Pictured is Tamerlan (C) Tsarnaev, accompanied by his father Anzor (L), mother Zubeidat and uncle Muhamad Suleimanov (R), in this photo courtesy of the Suleimanova family.Tamerlan was interviewed by the FBI in 2011, at the request of the lead Russian security agency, the FSB, which had been monitoring Tamerlan\u2019s alleged interactions with radical groups. Chechnya had by then suffered through the second of two wars since 1994, and the turmoil had spawned a terrorist insurgency, influenced by Islamic extremists, that had affected the entire North Caucasus.According to an FBI statement, the Russians reported that Tamerlan \u201cwas a follower of radical Islam\u201d and \u201chad changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country\u2019s region to join unspecified underground groups.\u201dThe youngest TsarnaevDzhokhar, by contrast, was considered smart but quiet, always in his older siblings\u2019 shadow, according to friends and acquaintances.When the family moved to the Boston area, Dzhokhar, then 8, spent second grade at an elementary school in Needham, a Boston suburb. He lived with the family of a prominent Chechen doctor, Khassan Baiev.Baiev\u2019s daughter Maryam remembers Dzhokhar, who later called himself Jahar, as a happy boy who was good at math, who liked to rollerblade and bicycle around the neighborhood playground.As they grew older, however, she said she had few interactions with him, only occasionally by Facebook.\u201cI remember when I saw him on TV\u2026 I ran straight to my brother, and said, \u201cDid you see who was on TV?\u2019 He said \u201cYeah, I saw it,\u2019\u201d Baieva, 21, said. \u201cI was more upset. I felt bad for [Dzhokhar] and I felt bad for his parents, everything he put them through.Friends say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was smart and quiet, always in the shadow of his older siblings.\u201cI felt heartbroken, betrayed at the time. It was scary, because I didn\u2019t know how people were going to look at me after, what people were going to think of me afterward,\u201d she said.Unlike with Tamerlan - the trip to Russia, the mosque outburst, the initial FBI investigation - Dzhokhar\u2019s involvement in the attack was even more baffling. According to friends and acquaintances, he never elicited attention or worry prior to April 15, 2013: not from neighbors or friends, not from school, not from law enforcement.At Cambridge\u2019s Rindge and Latin high school, Dzhokhar was known as low-key, laid-back and friendly. He was captain of the public school\u2019s wrestling team, an honor student and the recipient of a small scholarship from the city of Cambridge.At the Dartmouth campus of the University of Massachusetts, Dzhokhar was known as a middling student and, according to The Boston Globe, an active dealer of marijuana.\u201cDzhokhar kept to himself, he was smart. He made his own choices,\u201d the family friend said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the center of attention; he was always off to the side.\u201d\u201cI never worried about Dzhokhar,\u201d the friend said.In the months immediately before the bombing, the Norfolk Street apartment was occupied only by Tamerlan, his wife and their daughter. Katherine worked as a home health aide. His parents were both living in Russia. His sisters had moved out.On the Dartmouth campus, according to prosecutors, there were indications that Dzhokhar was exploring violent acts. Sometime in the spring of 2013, Dzhokhar downloaded to his computer several books and pamphlets espousing radical Islamist ideas.One was a book that contained a passage by a well-known al-Qaida propagandist, Anwar al-Awlaki. Another was a copy of the summer 2010 issue of Inspire magazine, an English-language publication by al-Qaida\u2019s affiliate on the Arabian Peninsula.The issue contained detailed instructions about making a pressure cooker bomb using common materials in an article titled: \u201cHow to Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.\u201dFireworks found inside a backpack belonging to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are seen in a handout photo released by the FBI, May 2, 2013.After his arrest, investigators later found Dzhokhar\u2019s college dormitory room, his computer and a backpack containing fireworks that had been emptied of gunpowder.The night of April 15, Dzhokhar sent a friend\u2014 the son of a prominent Boston-area Chechen \u00e9migr\u00e9\u2014 a text message asking him if he was at the marathon and was OK.On April 18, as police widened their search for the alleged bombers, the brothers shot and killed a police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, according to the grand jury indictment. Hours later, as the manhunt began closing in, Dzhokhar sent another text message to a college classmate saying: \u201cIf you want u can go to my room and take what you want.\u201dIn the early hours of April 19, with Tamerlan dead and the suburban town of Watertown resembling a war zone, Dzhokhar, bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds, huddled in a boat parked in a backyard driveway.Inside the hull and on an overhead beam, he scrawled several messages that give some insight into his motivations, according to the indictment:\u201cThe U.S. Government is killing our innocent civilians; I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished; We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all; Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam.... stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.\u201dTrial as closureFor victims, for friends of the Tsarnaev family, for Chechen immigrants, for marathon runners, for arguably just about everyone in Massachusetts, the trial scheduled for Monday is likely to be a riveting spectacle.FILE - Demonstrators asserting that evidence in the Boston Marathon bombing was fabricated stand outside the federal courthouse ahead of a pre-trial conference for suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in Boston, Dec. 18, 2014.For some, it will be a chance at vengeance and punishment for a young man whose seeming potential crashed to a halt on April 15, 2013.For others, it will be a chance at learning something more about why a laid-back, average, 19-year-old college student decided to participate in a horrific attack on bystanders celebrating a beloved sporting event.\u201cI want to know why he did it. I want to know why he would go out of his way, what did he need when he already has everything,\u201d said Baieva, the childhood friend.On December 18, Dzhokhar appeared at the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse, on Boston\u2019s waterfront, his last appearance before the formal beginning of his trial. It was his first public appearance since July 2013, when, still visibly wounded from the manhunt, he told the court he entered a plea of not guilty.A courtroom sketch depicts Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, December 18, 2014.During the 30-minute appearance on December 18, Dzhokhar \u2013 sporting a shock of bushy hair and a thin beard \u2013 played nervously with his hands and smiled occasionally when talking with his lawyers.He stood when the judge addressed him directly, and he responded respectfully, saying \u201cyes, sir,\u201d and \u201cno, sir.\u201dFederal prosecutors have indicated they will seek the death penalty if Dzhokhar is convicted. His defense lawyers are expected to seek leniency from the jury, arguing that Dzhokhar was an accomplice, but decidedly under the sway of his older brother.Defense lawyers have also made a flurry of last-minute court filings, seeking to either delay the trial or move it out of state. A filing last Monday by Tsarnaev\u2019s lead lawyer, Judy Clarke, suggested that the defense was trying reach a deal with the prosecution: possibly a guilty plea in exchange for a life prison sentence.\u201cIf the government remains unwilling to relent in seeking death, and the case therefore must be tried, the defense is asking for nothing more than a trial that is fair,\u201d she wrote.A couple embraces at a memorial on Boylston Street to the bombing victims, April 21, 2013.The trial portends renewed grief not only for the victims of the bombing. For the refugees of the Chechen wars and oppression, who came to the New England over the past two decades, settling in the United States was a chance for them to rebuild a semblance of peace and prosperity. The Boston Marathon bombings shattered that dream.Upon reaching the United States, \u201cfor the first time in my life I felt that I, my kids, my family \u2013 that we are safe and happy here. I prayed for America every evening,\u201d said Madina Khadzhimuradova, the Tsarnaev family friend.\u201cNow it is all gone. I am living in fear again, just like in the old times in Chechnya. We spoke about moving somewhere else, but where can we go? There is no place for Chechens on this Earth.\u201d", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack Bombing <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing Trial

{"text": "SURREY, British Columbia \u2014 A Boston Marathon-style attack on Canada Day festivities Monday was disrupted when the Mounties nabbed an al-Qaeda-inspired couple and seized pressure cooker bombs, police said.John Stewart Nuttall and Amanda Marie Korody were inspired by al-Qaeda ideology but were self-radicalized, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner James Malizia said yesterday. He called it a domestic threat without international connections.Malizia said there was no evidence to suggest a link to the deadly Boston Marathon bombings in April. But the plot outlined by the RCMP appears to parallel the case in Boston, where federal prosecutors say the Tsarnaev brothers learned how to make pressure cooker bombs from an online al-Qaeda magazine, and downloaded Islamic extremist texts meant to inspire lone wolves who operate on their own initiative.Nuttall and Korody were arrested on Monday, the same day that thousands attended the Canada Day celebrations at the provincial legislature in Victoria. Police said the bombs were found outside the legislature before the crowds gathered.\u201cThis self-radicalized behavior was intended to create maximum impact and harm to Canadian citizens at the B.C. legislature on a national holiday,\u201d RCMP Superintendent Wayne Rideout said. \u201cThey took steps to educate themselves and produce explosive devices designed to cause injury and death.\u201dPolice said a tip from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service led to a five-month investigation.

{"text": "An IRA member who was part of the group behind the Birmingham pub bombings has apologised.Michael Christopher Hayes \u2013 a self-confessed bomb maker \u2013 said he was sorry for the killing of innocent people in the 1974 blasts.Speaking to the BBC, Mr Hayes said he hoped his apology on behalf of all active republicans will help grieving relatives find \"closure\".He said: \"My apologies and my heartfelt sympathies to all of you, for the terrible, tragic loss that you've been put through. And all these years you've been trying to find closure. I hope at last God will be merciful and bring you closure.\"And I apologise not only for myself ... I apologise for all active republicans who had no intention of hurting anybody and sympathise with you.\"An eight-minute delay before police were warned of the bombs' location led to the death of 21 people and the injury of 182 others, when they exploded in a pair of city centre pubs. Mr Hayes said the bombs had not been intended to kill people.On the evening of the 21 November 1974, a man with an Irish accent called the Birmingham Post and Evening Mail newspapers to say two bombs were planted in the town centre.He finished the call by giving the official code used by the Provisional IRA to authenticate a warning call and allow civilians to be evacuated.Former IRA officials have since said there was an unintentional delay in issuing the warning.Mr Hayes said the IRA unit in Birmingham had been shocked by the death toll.\"That wasn't meant. It wouldn't have been done if that was the case,\" he said.The wreckage left at the Mulberry Bush pub in Birmingham after a bomb exploded on 21 November 1974 (PA)The Birmingham pub bombings caused the worst single losses of life in the Troubles. Six men were wrongfully convicted for the blasts but no-one has ever been brought to justice.Mr Hayes, 69, who now lives in south Dublin, said he personally defused a third bomb on Birmingham's Hagley Road after he became aware of the death toll in the first two blasts.He refused to say who planted the bombs in the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town but he said he wanted to speak out to give \"the point of view of a participant\".But relatives of those who were killed said the apology was \"gutless and spineless\".Mr Hayes' apology came as an inquest into the bombings was reopened by a coroner stating \"a wealth of evidence\" had not yet been heard.West Midland Police said their investigation remained open but that no further comments on the suspects' identities will be provided until the proceedings have concluded.Victims' families have repeatedly asked for the names of the suspects to be disclosed.Mr Hayes was arrested and questioned by West Midlands Police about the bombings in 1974 but he was released.He said he had been a member of the IRA for more than 30 years in both Ireland and England and had participated in the group's activities in Birmingham as \"an active volunteer\".UK news in pictures Show all 50 1 /50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 18 September 2020 A model presents a creation during the Bora Aksu catwalk show at London Fashion Week 2020 Reuters UK news in pictures 17 September 2020 World kickboxing champion Carl Thomas during his attempt to run a marathon while pulling a plane at Elvington Airfield near York.

{"text": "CNN interviews man claiming to be Maduro assassination attempt organizerImage: CNNIn this frame from CNN footage aired on March 14, a DJI Matrice M600 Pro equipped with the A3 Pro positioning system (the white discs), apparently the same model used in the attack in Caracas last August.Cable News Network (CNN), the American news outlet, has published a report with video following an interview with a man claiming to be the organizer of the August 4 assassination attempt in Caracas on Venezuela\u2019s president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, using two drones.Seven people were injured in the two explosions.A number of arrests were made following the attack, but it is unclear if the suspects had anything to do with the incident.The man, whose identity was not revealed, provided CNN with cellphone footage said to be from a rented farm at a remote site in Columbia.The videos show men unboxing and assembling two D\u00e0-Ji\u0101ng Innovations (DJI) Matrice M600 Pro c-drones on a billiards table.Scenes purporting to show an explosive charge mounted underneath one of the drones and a DJI flight controller were partially blurred by CNN editors.Video footage said to be taken on the grounds of the farmhouse show two DJI Phantom quadcopter drones being flown simultaneously in what was described as practice piloting.CNN did not specify that the Phantom quadcopters shown in the practice runs differ from the larger M600 Pro hexacopters shown being prepared for the attack.The man interviewed claimed that following the assassination attempt, he met with US officials on three occasions to answer their questions and solicit assistance, which he said was not forthcoming.The footage shows clearly that both of the M600 Pro drones are equipped with DJI\u2019s A3 Pro positioning system, a set of three redundant GPS units and controllers meant to provide more precise and reliable positioning than the stock single A3 system delivered on the original M600 model.The C-Drone Review had identified such a three-sensor system on one of the M600 drones which exploded in August from analysis of Telemundo footage.Although CNN in their report said the drones used in the attack were \"small\", the M600 Pro model is an industrial-grade hexacopter c-drone with a payload of 13lb (6kg) and is larger than the Phantom models shown flying in the footage.Video from last August in Caracas shows that the landing struts of the M600 Pros had been removed, lightening the drones for their one-way trips.The M600 Pro folds to a smaller size than the original M600; CNN said in their report they were told that the drones used in the attack were dismantled, taken over the border from Columbia to Venezuela, and reassembled there.Contacted, DJI could not definitively confirm that some of its drones appear in the footage aired by CNN, although that appears to be the case.A spokesman for DJI, Adam Lisberg, sent the following statement to the C-Drone Review:DJI makes drones entirely for peaceful purposes, and we absolutely deplore any attempt to use our drones to cause harm.We build safety features into our products to help drone pilots avoid flying in restricted areas, and we developed our AeroScope system to allow authorities to remotely identify and track airborne drones.We have little ability to control what people do with our products after purchase, but anyone who deliberately misuses our products should expect to be held responsible for their actions.Venezuela is in crisis, with widespread shortages of staple foodstuffs and medical supplies, rolling power outages, and thousands of inhabitants leaving the country every day.President Maduro has accused Columbia and the United States of conspiring against him, without proof.The US withdrew its last embassy personnel from Venezuela last week, as opposition politician Juan Guaid\u00f3 seeks to oust Maduro from power.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Contact interviews <extra_id_0> Participant man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact aired <extra_id_0> Communicator CNN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble equipped <extra_id_0> Artifact Matrice M600 Pro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components A3 Pro positioning system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact published <extra_id_0> Communicator CNN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact interview <extra_id_0> Participant man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosions  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble assembling <extra_id_0> Components Matrice M600 Pro c-drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble mounted <extra_id_0> Artifact drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components explosive charge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle dismantled <extra_id_0> Artifact the drones used in the attack <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble reassembled <extra_id_0> Artifact the drones used in the attack <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact met <extra_id_0> Participant officials <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flown <extra_id_0> Vehicle Phantom quadcopter drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassination <extra_id_0> Attacker man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Nicol\u00e1s Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrests <extra_id_0> Detainee suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize identified <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject three-sensor system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Defendant Columbia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation withdrew <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact personnel <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize claimed <extra_id_0> Identifier The man interviewed <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The 2001 shoe bomb attempt was a failed bombing attempt that occurred on December 22, 2001, on American Airlines Flight 63.The aircraft, a Boeing 767-300 (registration N384AA) with 197 passengers and crew aboard, was flying from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France, to Miami International Airport in the U.S. state of Florida.The perpetrator, Richard Reid, was subdued by passengers after unsuccessfully attempting to detonate plastic explosives concealed within his shoes.The flight was diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston, escorted by American jet fighters, and landed without further incident.Reid was arrested and eventually sentenced to 3 life terms plus 110 years, without parole.==Incident==As Flight 63 was flying over the Atlantic Ocean, Richard Reid \u2013 an Islamic fundamentalist from the United Kingdom, and self-proclaimed Al-Qaeda operative \u2013 carried shoes that were packed with two types of explosives.He had been refused permission to board the flight the day before.Passengers on the flight complained of a smoke smell shortly after meal service.One flight attendant, Hermis Moutardier, walked the aisles of the plane to locate the source.She found Reid sitting alone near a window, attempting to light a match.Moutardier warned him that smoking was not allowed on the airplane, and Reid promised to stop.A few minutes later, Moutardier found Reid leaning over in his seat, and unsuccessfully attempted to get his attention.After she asked him what he was doing, Reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse leading into the shoe, and a lit match.He was unable to detonate the bomb: perspiration from his feet dampened the triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and prevented it from igniting.Moutardier tried grabbing Reid twice, but he pushed her to the floor each time, and she screamed for help.When another flight attendant, Cristina Jones, arrived to try to subdue him, he fought her and bit her thumb.The  tall Reid who weighed about 215 pounds (97kg) was subdued by other passengers on the aircraft and immobilized using plastic handcuffs, seatbelt extensions, and headphone cords.A doctor administered diazepam found in the flight kit of the aircraft.Many of the passengers only became aware of the situation when the pilot announced that the flight was to be diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston.Two F-15 fighter jets escorted Flight 63 to Logan Airport.The plane parked in the middle of the runway, and Reid was arrested on the ground while the rest of the passengers were bussed to the main terminal.Authorities later found over 280\u00a0grams (10\u00a0oz) of TATP and PETN hidden in the hollowed soles of Reid's shoes, enough to blow a substantial hole in the aircraft.He pleaded guilty, was convicted, sentenced to 3 life terms plus 110 years without parole and incarcerated at Supermax prison ADX Florence.== Aftermath ==Six months after the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in Queens, New York on November 12, 2001, Mohammed Mansour Jabarah agreed to cooperate with American authorities in exchange for a reduced sentence.He said that fellow Canadian Abderraouf Jdey had been responsible for the flight's destruction, using a shoe bomb similar to that found on Reid several months earlier.This claim remains unsubstantiated by the investigation into the cause of the crash; Jabarah was a known colleague of Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, and said that Reid and Jdey had both been enlisted by the al-Qaeda chief to participate in identical plots.In 2006, security procedures at US airports were changed to have people remove their shoes before proceeding through scanners, in response to this incident.The requirement was phased out for some travelers, particularly those with TSA PreCheck, in the 2010s.Flight Number AAL63 continues to be used on the route from Paris to Miami.==External links==* Bomb on Flight 63 Telegraph Media Group

{"text": "Investigation of the Belated Production of Documents in the Oklahoma City Bombing Case\"The bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on April 19, 1995, was, at the time, the most significant act of terrorism that had ever taken place in the United States. Government agencies, led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), immediately began an extensive investigation to identify and prosecute the culprits. The investigation, known as OKBOMB, was run by a Task Force that consisted primarily of FBI investigators and support personnel and Department of Justice prosecutors. Within a few months, three individuals-Timothy McVeigh, Terry Nichols, and Michael Fortier-were indicted for crimes relating to the bombing. McVeigh and Nichols were convicted after trials, and Fortier pled guilty as part of a plea agreement with the government. McVeigh, who had devised the plot to bomb the Murrah Building and had planted the bomb, was sentenced to death. On May 8, 2001, one week before McVeigh's scheduled execution date, the Department of Justice and the FBI revealed to McVeigh's and Nichols' attorneys that over 700 investigative documents had not been disclosed to the defendants before their trials. The government acknowledged that it had violated a discovery order in the case, and the Attorney General stayed McVeigh's execution for one month in order to resolve the legal issues arising from the belated disclosure. Following the public revelation of the problem, and after finding and releasing more than 300 additional OKBOMB documents to the defense, the FBI came under severe criticism for its handling of the OKBOMB documents.\"United States.

This city has not experienced such a day of death and destruction since the German blitz of 1941. With the callous lack of remorse now so typical of the Provos they audaciously accept responsibility for what was an operation clearly requiring considerable planning and manpower. Throughout the 32 counties Irish men and women should ponder how a virulent Nazi-style disregard for life can lodge In the hearts of our fellow countrymen; all the more virulent in that once again the Innocent have been the main sufferers. Hitler In his Berlin bunker decided that the German people were no longer worthy of him and deserved not to survive. Yesterday's dead and injured and testimony to something similarly rotten in our philosophy of life. Every Irishman and woman must stand appalled and ashamed at the horror of what was perpetuated In Belfast yesterday In the name of Irish unity. Belfast is rocked and racked by the most ferocious blitz yet mounted by the IRA. Not even the German bombs could inflict more devastation on the capital of Ulster in the last war. On this unforgettable day 26 bombs, borne by car and planted to take the greatest toll of life, shattered the bodies of men, women and children in a fiendish holocaust of murder and hate. The wanton killing of non-combatant men, women and children-the inevitable consequence of exploding so many bombs without adequate warning - is yet another cruel act which will not be forgotten.A wanton attack on innocent men,women and childrenTHE FOLLOWING STATEMENT WAS MADE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND, MR. WILLIAM WHITELAW, IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, 24 JULY 1972:- As the House will know, the City and people of Belfast suffered a murderous sequence of explosions last Friday. Most of the 27 explosions in Belfast that day occurred within a 3\u00bd hour period in the afternoon-at a time when, and at places where high civilian casualties must have been expected and intended. No adequate warnings were given. Seven civilians and two soldiers were killed and at least 130 civilians injured-many gravely. I hardly need point out that all sections of the community are indiscriminately affected by these outrages. Of the dead two were Roman Catholics. Of the 130 injured at least 40 were Roman Catholics. 53 were men and boys, 77 women and children. I am sure the whole House will wish to join with me in expressing sympathy to the families of all those involved in this wanton attack on innocent men, women and children. After the appallingly bloodthirsty and criminal events of last Friday, there cannot be any remaining shred of support for the men who perpetrate them. Even those sectors of Roman Catholic opinion throughout the world which have traditionally identified themselves with and perhaps given the benefit of the doubt to any group of men who claimed to speak for the Irish Republican movement can surely no longer continue to uphold the men who were responsible for Friday's horrible catalogue of slaughter. Supporters of the Republican movement in this country, in Northern Ireland, in the United States and elsewhere, will no doubt notice the revulsion in some circles in the Irish Republic. Since Parliament at the end of March entrusted the Government with complete responsibility for all administration in Northern Ireland, we have made the most patient and reasoned effort to secure the end of violence. No one can deny that Her Majesty's Government have now an absolutely unchallengeable right to ask this House, this country, and indeed the whole world for their support in an absolute determination to destroy the capacity of the IRA for further acts of inhumanity. They have degraded the human race, and it must now be clear to all that their sole object is to promote their aims by violence and by violence alone.DESTRUCTION In Oxford Street bus station where death came to six people and scores were injured. The station was crowded when the bomb exploded. It was the worst of the afternoon's 19 murderous bombings.DESTRUCTION at Smithfield bus station, scene of the first of the vicious series of attacks on innocent people. Mercifully the buses here seen ablaze had not started filling up with passengers.DESTRUCTION in York Road railway terminus where the bomb was in an innocent-looking suitcase left on the platform.Letters to the Editor Funeral with no shouted commandsbut only sobs of four small childrenTO-DAY (Monday) I went to a funeral-that of one of \"Bloody Friday's\" victims. It wasn't one of those funerals we know so well in Belfast, with the uniformed men, the ceremonial shots, the shouted commands, the graveside oration. The only uniforms were the black and white vestments of the clergy. The only arms were those of Christ crucified on the Cross which led the Cortege. No shouted commands- only the sobbing of four small children. No graveside oration, only the tears in the eyes of a husband as final tribute. If there is power in the sobs of children and the tears of husbands and fathers, wives and mothers then the cause espoused by the terrorist is on the point of death: its followers now are but walking. dead, animated husks, soulless and mindless. rejected and disowned by any creature capable of pity and compassion. The earth which thudded on that coffin covered only a body, not the bestial deed which sent it there, an ever-pointing finger of condemnation to all involved - the terrorists who planned the bombing campaign, the terrorists who made the bombs, the terrorists who planted them: the politicians who wouldn't talk until all their demands were met and the politicians who talked too much and too often said the wrong thing; the leading churchmen, who merely mouthed pious attitudes. condemning violence in general but never aiming at specific deeds and organisations: The trade unionists who permitted discrimination to be the unwritten rule in our industrial life and the industrialists and businessmen who bowed to this evil on their premises; the neighbours, who were true neighbours and friends-until intimidation entered their street. To-day's victim had the dignity and honour of innocence and motherhood to take to her grave and Maker, and leaves her legacy of a peace-loving, and In the course of time, happy family. Her killers will face their Maker with her blood and many others on their hands and can only leave a. their legacy hatred, sorrow and despair.A FACE IN THE CROWD,Belfast 13.DESTRUCTION In Botanic Avenue after a bomb exploded in a hi-jacked bread van parked outside the York Hotel. Cars and houses suffered in the blast and there were the inevitable casualties.DESTRUCTION at the busy Antrim Road-Limeston Road corner. The wreckage in the forefront is all that was left of the stolen van in which the bomb had been planted. Women shoppers were among the casualties.DESTRUCTION at the shopping centre on the Cavehill Road, where one of the last of the bombs killed three people, including a mother of seven and a boy of 14.REPORTS 'Streets swept by terror' \"Such warnings as were given were so vague and imprecise as to be almost useless; For much of the afternoon Belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic. Girls and men wept openly, hugging each other for safety in the main streets as plumes of smoke rose around them and dull thuds echoed from wall to wall. It was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe As each bomb exploded there were cries of terror from people who thought they had found sanctuary but in fact were just as exposed as before. Report in the Guardian.'A day of horror and shame' Friday, July 21, 1972, was a day of horror and shame in this stricken city. Even hardened newsmen recoiled with shock from the scenes of carnage witnessed in Belfast as firemen lifted the mangled bodies where bombs ripped through crowds of unsuspecting men, women and children at bus depots and other locations. In all my years of journalism, which included the worst days of the wartime blitzes, I have never seen scenes so horrible in this city and one felt a deep feeling of anger and shame that such deeds were planned and carried out by fellow Irishmen. All Ireland has been shamed by the events of this terrible July afternoon in Belfast. Report in the Irish Independent, Dublin.'A deed of sick men' \"The chief injury is not to the British Army, to the Establishment or to big business but to the plain people of Belfast and Ireland. Anyone who supports violence from any s i d e after yesterday's events is sick with the same affliction as those who did the deed. \"Can anyone now believe that anything worth while can be established by these methods? That the country of anyone's vision can live with more memories of this kind?\" \"Irish Times\", Dublin. 'The cold-blooded, co-ordinated bomb outrages are a shocking crime against an already innocent population who have already suffered too much. These were brutal murders which will be totally condemned by every decent person in the United Kingdom.'Mr. Harold Wilson, Leader of the OppositionTHE BOMBERS STRIKE - AND THIS IS SOME OF THE SUFFERING THEY LEFTScenes of anguish in Oxford Street Bus Station where six people died - as pictured in the Daily Express \"A black sin ... that will never be erased\" By the Editor of theSunday IndependentDublin These are dark days for Ireland. We live in an age of cowardice, with the guilt spread evenly between the highest and the lowest in the land. We fostered the men who planned the murders of innocent men, women, boys and girls in Belfast on Friday. We fed these people with propaganda. We took advantage, when we could, of their exploits. And because we are not a morally courageous people, we never seriously tried to stop their terrible excesses. Those among us who could have acted to halt the course of tragedy preferred to do nothing. Those who could have spoken out, when words might have meant something, chose to hold their tongues. And the rest of us were content to let matters slide. Now all of us must pay the price for this neglect. There is a black sin on the face of Irish Republicanism today that will never be erased. Murder now lies at the feet of the Irish nation and there is no gain-saying that fact. We cannot change past, however much we regret its record. But if we wish to restore the honour of our people, now is the time to act. We must break the paralysis that leaves the good name of the Irish people in the hands of unscrupulous men. And we must find a way to make restitution for our failings. The gallantry of those who planted bombs in the middle of Belfast's shopping areas on Friday (and then ran like hell) will be sanctified by the almighty god of Irish republicanism and reverently embalmed- in what we are pleased to call our national heritage. We won't have a ballad to commemorate the butchered fragments of a woman we saw on the telly being shovelled up by a fireman. Who said Dan Breen is dead?

{"text": "Teaching student jailed over Sweden terror plotThe 20-year-old and his lawyer.Photo: Janerik Henriksson/TTA 20-year-old former teaching student has been locked up for five years for plotting a suicide attack in Sweden.Aydin Sevigin was arrested in February, suspected of having tried to build a bomb.Police found six bottles of aceton, duct tape, a mobile phone and bullets during a search of his home.A receipt for Christmas tree lights and surveillance footage showing him buying a pressure cooker from Ikea were also part of the case.The 20-year-old, who grew up in the well-off suburb Danderyd north of Stockholm, denied the claims, but refused to explain why he bought the ingredients, which can be used to build bombs.\"My opinion is that he acquired, stored and collected liquids and objects to make and then blow up a suicide bomb in order to become a martyr.The criminal act being prepared could seriously have hurt Sweden,\" prosecutor Ewamari H\u00e4ggkvist said ahead of the verdict.Attunda District Court, north of Stockholm, sentenced him to five years in jail on Thursday morning for \"preparing to commit a terror crime\".It said it had reduced the sentence by one year because he is aged under 21.\"It is not clear what would have been the target of a bomb attack.But we believe that blowing up a shrapnel bomb of this kind would have been able to harm Sweden and that the purpose of such a bomb must have been to instil fear in the way referred to by terrorism legislation,\" said the chairman of the court, Mikael Swahn, in a statement.Sevigin's relatives had raised the alarm several months before he was arrested.In June last year one of his family members called the police, saying he was concerned about the 20-year-old, who had then disappeared.He was shortly thereafter stopped in Turkey on two occasions.The first time he was made to return to Greece, the second time he was flown back to Sweden from Istanbul.His intention is believed to have been to travel onwards to Syria to join Isis.Several of his relatives stated during the investigation and trial that the 20-year-old had been experiencing symptoms of depression, isolating himself from others and expressing radical opinions sympathizing with Isis.It was not immediately known if his legal team would attempt to appeal the sentence.The verdict came on the same day as a separate terror trial got under way in Sweden.A 25-year-old man is charged with attempting to travel to Syria to join a militant group.The trial is the first of its kind applying Sweden's new anti-terror laws making it illegal to travel abroad to join terror organizations.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain jailed <extra_id_0> Detainee Teaching student <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer Sweden <extra_id_1>

{"text": "A 40-year-old Japanese man admitted he landed an unmanned drone in central Tokyo carrying radioactive sand atop Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's office to protest nuclear power, police said Saturday.The drone, which had a sign on it saying it was radioactive, was carrying a camera and plastic container with sand contaminated with radioactive cesium, Japanese media said. The police said the radiation was low and did not pose a threat. The stunt initially brought fears of a terrorist attack.Yasuo Yamamoto, who is unemployed, faces a maximum three years in prison if convicted on charges of obstruction of official business. Local media reported that the police said the landing was a protest against nuclear power.Abe is pushing to restart Japan's nuclear reactors which are offline in the wake of the Fukushima disaster caused by a tsunami in 2011. Public broadcaster NHK said the sand the drone was carrying came from an area near the Fukushima meltdown.The drone was discovered Wednesday when new employees were taking a tour of the roof. It was believed to have landed there two weeks ago.\u201cI was operating the drone around 3:30 in the morning on April 9 to express my opposition to nuclear power generation,\u201d police quoted the alleged drone operator as saying.The Asahi Shimbun said the man surrendered to police on Friday.

{"text": "HOUSTON \u2013 A 26-year-old man has been sentenced to federal prison following his conviction for attempting to maliciously damage property receiving federal financial assistance, announced U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick. Andrew Schneck pleaded guilty March 27, 2018.Today, U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. handed Schneck a 78-month sentence to be immediately followed by three years of supervised release. The court also imposed a $10,000 fine.On the evening of Aug. 19, 2017, a Houston park ranger observed Schneck kneeling among the bushes in front of the General Dowling Monument located in Hermann Park in Houston. Schneck was holding two small boxes with various items inside to include what appeared to be duct tape and wires. After placing the boxes on the ground per the ranger\u2019s request, Schneck took a drink of clear liquid from a plastic bottle, spit it out and poured the remainder on the ground. The ranger then noticed a timer and wires in the box and notified the Houston Police Department (HPD).The HPD Bomb Squad tested the clear liquid and a white powdery substance found in a small, black aluminum tube which revealed they were nitroglycerin and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), respectively. HMTD is a high explosive organic compound used as an initiating, or primary, explosive. Nitroglycerin is used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of explosives. ln its pure form, nitroglycerin is a contact explosive with physical shock causing it to explode and which degrades over time to even more unstable forms. Nitroglycerin is highly dangerous to transport or use.The FBI Explosive Unit Laboratory examined the items in Schneck\u2019s possession on Aug. 19 and determined them to comprise a fully functioning improvised explosive device.Schneck has been and will remain in custody pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.The FBI and HPD conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorneys S. Mark McIntyre and Craig M.

{"text": "Bologna, August 2, 1980. It was a hot Saturday morning, the first weekend of Italy\u2019s traditional holiday month, and thousands of vacationers jostled their way to and from the trains in Bologna\u2019s central railroad station. In the midst of that noisy crowd someone stopped midway between the second-class waiting room and the coffee bar, put down a heavy suitcase, and quickly left the station. The suitcase contained over forty pounds of explosives, perhaps stable nitroglycerine, connected to a timer. At exactly 10:25 AM it exploded, ripping through the crowd, tearing apart the reinforced concrete walls, and bringing the roof crashing down on hundreds of bodies and parts of bodies.In the bloody aftermath, rescue squads worked for over twelve hours to pull the dead and maimed from the rubble. As they labored, a young neofascist entered a telephone booth across town and dialed Bologna\u2019s leading newspaper. \u201cThis is the Armed Revolutionary Nuclei,\u201d he said. \u201cWe claim responsibility for the explosion in the railway station.\u201d The final toll: eighty-five dead\u2014the eldest an eighty-six-year-old man, the youngest a three-year-old child\u2014and more than two hundred wounded.Eight weeks later, on the evening of September 26, a young man, Gundolf Koehler, tried to place six pounds of explosives in a refuse can at the entrance to Munich\u2019s Oktoberfest. The bomb went off, killing him and twelve others, wounding 215 people. On Koehler\u2019s body were found documents linking him to the illegal paramilitary Defense Sport Group of the neo-Nazi Karl-Heinz Hoffmann, who styles himself the \u201cspiritual descendant\u201d of Adolf Hitler and who has organized military maneuvers in southern Germany for his followers. Arrested along with twenty-four of his militants, Hoffmann was later released for lack of evidence.A week later in Paris a twenty-six pound bomb exploded in front of the rue Copernic synagogue, where hundreds of Jews were gathered for sabbath services. The bomb killed four persons and wounded thirteen; if it had gone off twenty minutes later, when services would have ended, it would have killed scores of worshipers leaving the synagogue. The act was claimed by the European National Fasces (FNE), the same group that had machine-gunned five Jewish buildings in Paris a week earlier.These latest of neofascist massacres have awakened Europeans to what many of them had managed not to see: the maturation over the last five years of what analysts now call Eurofascism\u2014loosely associated but politically aligned neo-Nazi groups, many of them dedicated to terrorism, all of them intent on saving Europe from the twin evils of capitalism and Marxism. While their membership is relatively small, they are well funded and some have access to training camps in Lebanon. In an interview given eight days before the Munich explosion, the PLO leader Abu Ayad revealed that in late 1979 two members of Hoffmann\u2019s group were captured in Lebanon and confessed to him that they and some thirty other European fascists were training at the Falangist camp at Aquru, northeast of Beirut.

Perez confirmed that so far in 2014, there have been 398 cases of chikungunya and 45,745 cases of dengue fever in the country.Both diseases are mosquito-borne. The mortality rate for dengue fever ranges between 1-5%. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the mortality for chikungunya during an outbreak in Africa in 2005-2006 was nearly 0%.Perez conceded that the country is experiencing a shortage of acetaminophen, a medicine used as a pain killer and fever reducer used to combat the symptoms of the diseases. However, Perez assured, the government is doing all it can to resolve the shortage.Doctors Want Emergency DeclaredThe head of the infectious diseases department at the Hospital Universitario de Caracas, Maria Eugenia Landaeta, called on the government today to declare the chikungunya outbreak an emergency. Landaeta said:It\u2019s the first thing you should do because that allows for planification and for the allocation of resources to attack the virus.Landaeta also speculated that the nine unexplained deaths over the last week in Aragua might have been the result of complications from the disease. She said:What we\u2019re thinking, based on the symptoms, is that it could be an instance of complicated cases of chikungunya.She also dismissed the rumours that the disease might be ebola, saying that as far as she was aware none of the victims had any contact whatsoever with anyone from Africa. Landaeta also called on Venezuelans to think critically, and to not fall into a \u201ccollective panic\u201d regarding these diseases.Alleged Ongoing Confrontation Leaves Students InjuredAn alleged ongoing confrontation in or around the Universidad de Los Andes campus in Tachira state between students and security forces has left at least one student injured.

{"text": "Prosecutors Push Death Sentence for Boston Bomber TsarnaevNearly two weeks after convicting accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev of all 30 charges against him, jurors Tuesday heard reasons he should be put to death.U.S. prosecutors showed the 12-member jury a photo of Tsarnaev giving the middle finger to a surveillance camera the day of his first court appearance in 2013.\"This is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini. \"Unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged.\"The 21-year-old, an ethnic Chechen U.S. immigrant-turned-citizen, was found guilty of working with his older brother, Tamerlan, to carry out the April 15, 2013 attack. The twin pressure cooker bombs they set off killed three people and wounded 264. The two brothers also fatally shot a police officer as they tried to elude a massive police manhunt. The elder Tsarnaev was killed days after the bombings during their attempted escape.The court Tuesday was shown large photos of the four dead victims.\"They were all beautiful, and they're all now gone,\" said Pellegrini. She described the killings as \"unbearable, indescribable, inexcusable and senseless,\" labeling the younger Tsarnaev \"America's worst nightmare.\"Witnesses who lost limbs or loved ones in the bombings also were called to the stand, recounting the horror of the attack.Jurors must now determine whether Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death or life in prison. The penalty phase of the trial could last a month. If the jury does not agree unanimously on a death sentence, a life without parole sentence will be imposed automatically.Tsarnaev's attorneys, pushing for life behind bars, have argued that his radicalized older brother was the driving force behind the attack, and that Dzhokhar played a secondary role out of a sense of sibling loyalty.Some survivors and the parents of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who died in the attack, also have lobbied publicly against a death sentence.\"We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty,\" Bill and Denise Richard wrote in an essay in The Boston Globe last week, \"but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong the most painful day of our lives.\"Over the past 15 years, only three people have been put to death by the federal government - Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, drug smuggler Juan Raul Garza and kidnapper Louis Jones. Tsarnaev's lawyers acknowledged from the start of the federal trial that he was involved in the plot to detonate the bombs. But defense attorney Judy Clarke, who has successfully kept other notorious U.S. murder convicts off death row, told the jury at the end of the first phase of the trial, \"If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened.\"The elder Tsarnaev died after being shot by police and inadvertently driven over by Dzhokhar as the two brothers attempted to flee the Boston area.Dzhokhar was later found hiding in a boat parked in the backyard of a suburban Boston home. Prosecutors say he scrawled a motive for the attack on the inside wall of the boat, writing that the brothers were trying to avenge American attacks on Muslims in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Sentence Sentence <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt Prosecutors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant Bomber Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicting <extra_id_0> Defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact heard <extra_id_0> Participant jurors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Topic Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Participant U.S <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact showed <extra_id_0> Participant jury <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker 21-year-old <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim 264 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die shot <extra_id_0> Victim officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer brothers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation elude  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation escape  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact described <extra_id_0> Participant She <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Martin Richard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die death <extra_id_0> Victim Louis Jones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shot <extra_id_0> Attacker police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack driven over <extra_id_0> Attacker Dzhokhar <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flee <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact brothers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin area <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact wrote <extra_id_0> Participant Denise Richard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic death penalty <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Pellegrini <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

Surrounding buildings and two cars were severely damaged. Local people said rumours of bomb threats had been sweeping the Brick Lane area all week.Police are linking the explosion with last Saturday's bomb in Brixton which injured 39 people. Responsibility for that bomb has been claimed by four racists groups.Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry, head of anti-terrorist branch, said: \"The device has similarities to the device that exploded in Brixton with terrible consequences last Saturday. I am linking the crimes. We are treating this as a racist offence.\"Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking in Washington where he is attending a Nato summit said: \"These things are outrageous and we will not tolerate them and we will make every effort to find out those responsible and bring them to justice.\"A spokesman for The Royal London Hospital at Whitechapel, close to the scene of the explosion, said it had treated five casualties from the blast, two women and three men, all middle-aged.Superintendent David Finnimore said he believed a man was driving the device to Brick Lane police station, a local office closed at weekends, when it went off. Amazingly, the man suffered only slight injuries. The blast destroyed a green Volvo and a maroon Ford Sierra.Police cordoned off the area and evacuated hundreds of people before checking under rows of parked cars in case there were any more devices primed to go off.Louise Allan, 29, of New Zealand, was 20 metres away when the bomb went off. She said: \"We were sitting in Brick Lane and I heard a hollow sound and I said to my friend that it sounded like a bomb. We went down the road and saw smoke. The whole of the road was filled with thick black smoke.\"A Tower Hamlets councillor told how he ran to the scene after hearing the blast. Raja Miah said: \"When I got there it looked like a scene from a war zone. I saw a car ablaze with pieces of shrapnel and debris all over the place.

US officials have met Taliban representatives in a number of countries. The Taliban has refused to meet Afghan government officials, calling them \u201cpuppets\u201d.US Senator Lindsey Graham said in Pakistan on Sunday President Donald Trump should meet Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan as soon as possible to reset long-difficult US relations and push for a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan.US relations with Pakistan have been strained by suspicions that elements in the Pakistani establishment were aiding the Taliban, a charge Islamabad strongly denies.

{"text": "Video: Utah trooper hit from behind by runaway car in Sardine CanyonA Utah High Patrolman was hospitalized after a sliding car hit him from behind in Sardine Canyon on Sunday.(Courtesy of Utah Department of Public Safety)SALT LAKE CITY, Utah (KUTV) - A Utah highway patrolman was hospitalized after a sliding car hit him from behind in Sardine Canyon on Sunday.Sergeant Cade Brenchley, a second-generation trooper, was responding to multiple cars that had slid off the road in the canyon.The trooper was walking toward a stranded white car when he was hit from behind by a black runaway car that was sliding.When Brenchley was hit, the video shows him launched into the air before landing beside the white car.On Tuesday, Brenchley spoke to the media for the first time since he was hit.\"I am extremely grateful to be alive ,\" he said.Brenchley suffered broken ribs and a broken scapula.He was transported to the Logan Regional Hospital.\"I remember thinking to myself, I\u2019ve been hit.Holy crap, I\u2019ve been hit,\" Brenchley said.His wife and four children joined him during the press conference.They said they are extremely grateful he is okay.\"It could have taken me away from my kids and we watched the video and by all means it probably should have,\" Brenchley said.He is happy to share his story if it means preventing future accidents.\"We\u2019re all trying to get to our destination.We\u2019re trying to get there safely, but we\u2019ve got to pay attention to what\u2019s going on around us,\" he said.According to a Utah Department of Public Safety news release, this marks the 11th trooper hit on Utah roads this year.\"Our department is thankful to the multiple bystanders who came to the aid of Sgt.Brenchley after he was struck,\" the news release states.\"The dash cam video shows many people on the scene who stopped to offer aid and called for help on his car radio.Some of the Cache Valley first responders included three of Sgt.Brenchley's cousins.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Injure hit <extra_id_0> Victim trooper <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument car <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Intervention hospitalized <extra_id_0> Patient Patrolman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure hit <extra_id_0> Instrument car <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Intervention hospitalized <extra_id_0> Patient patrolman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure hit <extra_id_0> Instrument car <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure hit <extra_id_0> Victim he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument car <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure hit <extra_id_0> Victim Brenchley <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure hit <extra_id_0> Victim he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation transported <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination Logan Regional Hospital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation get <extra_id_0> Destination destination <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure hit <extra_id_0> Victim trooper <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure struck <extra_id_0> Victim he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact called <extra_id_0> Participant people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "A statement after a two-hour emergency meeting at Stormont Castle, said that Mr Whitelaw, the defence secretary, Lord Carrington, and army and civilian advisers, had considered the Provisional IRA's \"bombing outrages\".\"They deplored the slaughter and maiming of men, women and children, which took place today on Provisional IRA orders, clearly acting with the utmost ferocity. In the light of these murderous attacks, the ministers authorised certain operations against the terrorists to be undertaken forthwith.\"Early today Mr Whitelaw gave an interview to the BBC about forthcoming security measures. He said: \"I am going to make an immediate and clear response to the ghastly attacks on innocent people that have taken place in the last 24 hours.\"This will be a clearly determined operation that will do everything possible to root out those responsible for these appalling crimes.\" He added that the measures would become apparent \"very soon\".On the question of the possible reintroduction of internment, he said: \"The internment of suspects is never ruled out, but I don't contemplate it with any pleasure.\"Shootings in Belfast had continued last night. In one incident, a man was killed and five more were wounded, in a battle between troops and terrorists in the Markets area. The army claimed to have hit three gunmen.Later, a man was shot dead when he answered a knock at his door in Deerpark Road, in the Old Park district of the city.Just after 11.30pm a wave of shooting broke out in the main Catholic areas. The army said that the initial shooting incidents did not involve the security forces, but that after midnight their posts in Anderstown and the Old Park Road came under intense gunfire. There were no military casualties.In the afternoon, during an hour of concentrated bombing at least 11 people died. They included two soldiers, a little girl and a messenger boy. Ninety six people were detained in hospital, and about 24 others were allowed home after treatment.The Provisional IRA accepted responsibility for the bombings, which seemed to be aimed at civilians. It claimed that at least 30 minutes' warning was given before each explosion, but the warnings which were received were so vague as to be almost useless.A spokesman for the Belfast Brigade of the Provisional IRA pointed out that telephoned warnings were given to the Samaritans, the police, newspapers and the local Rumour Service and Public Protection Service at least thirty minutes before each explosion. In the case of the two worst explosions at Oxford Street and the Cavehill Road, warnings were given well in advance. The Oxford Street warning was heard over the military radio net at 2.10pm, and a woman telephoned the police telling of a box in the back of a car on the Cavehill Road an hour before the explosion.Huge explosive decides were detonated at places certain to be thronged with people - bus termini, railway stations, and shopping centres. It was calculated that over 1,000lb of explosives had been used.At 2.45pm, when the bombing began, and for much of the afternoon, Belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic.Girls and men wept openly, hugging each other for safety in the main streets, as plumes of smoke rose around them, and dull thuds echoed from wall to wall.It was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe. As each bomb exploded there were cries of terror from people who thought they had found sanctuary, but in fact were just as exposed as before.Thousands streamed out of the stricken city immediately after the attacks, and huge traffic jams built up. All bus services were cancelled, and on some roads hitch hikers frantically trying to get away lined the pavements.By the time it was all over, some 21 bombs had gone off in Belfast and there were fears of more to come. Sources close to the Provisionals indicated that more were planned for last night and for the weekend.Mr Whitelaw and Lord Carrington immediately flew back to Belfast in an RAF transport plane for their emergency meeting. The army GOC, Sir Harry Tuzo, the acting chief of the RUC, Mr David Corbett, and one of Mr Whitelaw's juniors, Mr David Howell, also attended.From at least two Ulster Protestant politicians, there were urgent demands last night for an immediate resumption of the internment policy. One of them, Mr William Craig, leader of Ulster Vanguard, and a former Stormont Cabinet Minister, called for its \"immediate massive resumption\".While this course was not thought one of those Mr Whitelaw was more likely to pursue, it was felt that stringent security measures must now be enforced.The possibility that a major cordon-and-search operation may now be undertaken in one of the prime Republican areas - possibly even in the Andersonstown estate where the Belfast IRA leaders meet and plan their main operations - is becoming very real indeed.If Mr Whitelaw does not act swiftly, there is little doubt here that understandably militant Protestants, headed by the huge and formidably well disciplined Ulster Defence Association, may decide to take the law into their own hands.Last night the UDA leaders were meeting in emergency session in a house in the city and refused to comment on their plans. They did stress, however, that no action was contemplated for some hours. But only four hours after the bombing, UDA car and foot patrols were seen on the streets in East Belfast. Presumably they were there in a defensive role for a very frightened and intimidated Protestant population.The bombs began to explode before 3pm. Then for roughly 20 minutes they exploded roughly at one a minute. Smoke appeared in all directions above the roofs of shops and offices. As the attacks continued, and the whole city centre echoed to the crack of the bombs, a few people began to panic.

{"text": "The Tokyo District Court handed down a suspended sentence Tuesday to the man who landed a drone on the rooftop of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office last April.Yasuo Yamamoto, 41, was sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for four years.Presiding Judge Mihoko Tanabe also ordered the drone confiscated.According to the complaint, Yamamoto, a resident of Obama, Fukui Prefecture, flew the drone out of a parking lot near the Prime Minister\u2019s Office in Chiyoda Ward on April 9 and intentionally landed it on the roof of the government building.The drone, equipped with flares and a container filled with radioactive soil and affixed with a radiation sticker, was discovered by officials nearly two weeks later on April 22.Although his action did not endanger anyone, his intention to interrupt official duties at the office was clear, Tanabe said in handing down the sentence.Yamamoto had pleaded not guilty. His lawyers said he intended to challenge the Abe administration\u2019s policy on nuclear energy, and that as a form of protest the move did not break any laws.Prosecutors had demanded a three-year prison term for Yamamoto as well as the confiscation of his drone. They said his actions were premeditated and clearly intended to interfere with official duties.An expressionless Yamamoto, who appeared at the court in a gray sweatshirt and sweatpants, sat with his head down as the sentence was read out.The incident ignited a heated discussion about the need for regulations for drones.In September, the government revised the Aviation Law to set the first restrictions on how to operate drones.The law, which has been in effect since December, bans drones from areas near airports and above densely populated areas, including all 23 wards in central Tokyo, unless granted government permission.

He spoke Arabic intermittently during his statement, and then translated for the court.He was also convicted of attempted murder of US officers or employees, and four counts of possessing a weapon in furtherance of a federal crime of violence.Abdo told police in a recorded interview he planned the attack \"because I don't appreciate what my unit did in Afghanistan\".According to authorities, he intended to set off a bomb in a Chinese restaurant popular with Fort Hood soldiers and their families. Then Abdo planned to wait outside and shoot any survivors.He believed he would become a martyr when police killed him, they added.Abdo referred to Maj Nidal Hasan, an army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 people in a 2009 shooting at Fort Hood, and told the court he remained in the accused's shadow despite \"efforts to outdo him\".", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker Naser Jason Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Fort Hood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blow up <extra_id_0> Attacker US soldier <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target troops <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Texas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict guilty <extra_id_0> Defendant Naser Jason Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Fort Hood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Fort Hood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place motel room <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing trial <extra_id_0> Defendant Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt judge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing telling <extra_id_0> Defendant Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt judge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing appeared <extra_id_0> Defendant He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing statement <extra_id_0> Defendant Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack murder <extra_id_0> Target officers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> Target soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Chinese restaurant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shooting <extra_id_0> Attacker Maj Nidal Hasan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Fort Hood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "A Canadian academic was charged in Paris on Saturday over the deadly 1980 bombing of a Paris synagogue, the man\u2019s lawyer said.University professor Hassan Diab, a Canadian of Lebanese descent, appeared before an anti-terror judge just hours after arriving from Montreal after losing a six-year legal battle against extradition.The October 3, 1980, bombing of a synagogue on rue Copernic in Paris killed four people and marked the first fatal attack against the French Jewish community since the Nazi occupation in World War II.Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign UpThe 60-year-old sociologist had been fighting his extradition to avoid what he said would be an unfair prosecution in France for a crime he insists he did not commit.Diab\u2019s extradition came after Canada\u2019s supreme court refused on Thursday to hear his final plea to halt the procedure.Diab was arrested at his home in an Ottawa suburb in November 2008 at the request of French authorities who alleged he was a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.The extremist group pioneered armed jetliner hijackings in the 1960s and was believed to be behind a string of deadly attacks in Europe, including the Paris bombing.Canada\u2019s justice minister signed an order in April 2012 to send Diab to France after a Canadian court approved his extradition, despite its concerns that the French case was \u201cweak\u201d.Diab has said he has \u201cabsolutely no connection whatsoever to the terrible 1980 attack,\u201d while his legal team argued he should not be extradited because a conviction in Canada would be unlikely.Synagogue packedThat attack on the synagogue happened on a Friday evening, the eve of the Jewish sabbath when it was packed with some 300 worshipers.Ten kilograms of explosives packed in the saddlebags of a parked motorcycle were detonated and the ensuing blast killed three Frenchmen and a young Israeli woman and wounded some 40 people.Police first focused on the far right as possible perpetrators of the bombing before turning their attention to extremist groups in the Middle East, but made no headway in the case for years.The probe was relaunched in October 2007 to gain information from the United States on Diab, who had spent several years in the country.Diab became a Canadian citizen in 2006 and is now the father of a nearly two-year-old girl with his common-law wife.He has claimed that he was studying in Beirut at the time of the bombing and has said that he had been confused with someone with the same name.Diab\u2019s lawyers in Canada have mainly sought to discredit what they called \u201cfatally flawed\u201d handwriting analysis of a Paris hotel slip that French authorities say was signed in the same false identity that was also presented to purchase the motorcycle used in the bombing.Diab\u2019s lawyers have said that the fingerprint evidence does not match Diab\u2019s and that the person who signed the hotel slip was described by witnesses as being middle-aged, whereas Diab would have been 26 at the time.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant academic <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Paris <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target synagogue <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Paris <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target synagogue <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place rue Copernic <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target community <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing appeared <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt judge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant Hassan Diab <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation arriving <extra_id_0> Origin Montreal <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Hassan Diab <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Diab <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Place Europe <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Paris <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target synagogue <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim woman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime probe <extra_id_0> Defendant Diab <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell purchase <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity motorcycle <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "FBI Looking for 2 Men Who Allegedly Found Explosive Device in NYCThe U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is asking the public for help in locating two men who allegedly found a piece of luggage on a New York sidewalk that contained an explosive device that may be tied to the suspect in Saturday's bombings in New York and New Jersey.On Wednesday the FBI issued a statement and a photo of two men that was taken on Saturday, September 17, in the same hour an explosive device detonated. The FBI said the men took the luggage, which was located only four blocks or so from the New York bombing site, and left the device behind. That device did not detonate.Federal investigators said during a news conference Wednesday the men are wanted as witnesses only.Federal investigators said earlier the suspect in Saturday's bombings in New York and New Jersey has been charged with use of a weapon of mass destruction in the weekend attacks. Investigators said he bought components on eBay and used as triggering devices cell phones purchased from a store 500 meters from an address he once listed as his home.Evidence teams investigate at the scene of Saturday's explosion on West 23rd Street in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood in New York, Sept. 19, 2016. Ahmad Khan Rahami, a U.S. citizen of Afghan descent has been charged in the bombing.Multiple federal chargesThe details are contained in criminal complaints made public Tuesday spelling out multiple federal charges against 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami. Most of the charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.Authorities arrested Rahami on Monday after an exchange of gunfire with police that left him and two officers wounded.According to the court documents, investigators believe Rahami used an eBay account with the username \"ahmad rahimi\" to buy citric acid, a circuit board, electric igniters and hundreds of ball bearings between June 20 and August 10. The items were shipped to a business in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, where Rahami worked until September 12.Ball bearings were found in two pressure cooker bombs placed four blocks apart in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York late Saturday. One of them exploded, injuring 29 people, while the other was recovered intact. Investigators said the second bomb had \"numerous\" electric igniters.That second device was tested for fingerprints, and the criminal complaint said all 12 prints found were matches for Rahami. The documents say his prints were also found on items inside of a backpack that was discovered late Sunday at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, just outside of New York. The bag contained multiple explosive devices, including one that blew up as police tried to disarm it with a robot.Authorities also tied Rahami to a bomb that blew up in a trash can in Seaside Park, New Jersey, early Saturday.That link involved one of the cell phones that investigators said were shipped last year to a store in Perth Amboy near the address that Rahami provided as his home in a 2012 passport application. They said a second phone shipped to the same place was used in the bomb that blew up in Chelsea.A third phone, one found with the other Chelsea bomb, was once registered to one of Rahami's family members, the documents said.A still image captured from a video from WABC television shows New York bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami being loaded into an ambulance after a shoot-out with police in Linden, New Jersey, Sept. 19, 2016.Surveillance videoInvestigators also said they used surveillance video to tie Rahami to the Chelsea bombs, with cameras putting him near the explosion site about 37 minutes before the blast and near where the other bomb was found two minutes after the first one went off. That second video, they said, showed him pulling a suitcase and then a short time later walking without it.The documents contain some pieces of writing from a journal found on Rahami when he was arrested.

{"text": "Boston Bomber Sentenced to DeathConvicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been sentenced to death over the April 2013 attack that killed three people and wounded 264 others.A Boston jury, consisting of seven men and five women, reached the decision Friday in the penalty phase of the trial after deliberating for more than 14 hours over three days. The jury unanimously determined that, based on the \"aggravating and mitigating circumstances,\" Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death.Karen Snyder, right, and Kathryn Vanwie react to the announcement of the death penalty verdict for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev outside the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in Boston, May 15, 2015.Unanimous decisionThe jury had to reach a unanimous decision for Tsarnaev to receive the death penatly. Otherwise, he would have spent the rest of his life in prison without parole.VOA's Fatima Tlisova reported from the courtroom that some of the jurors were crying as Tsarnaev sat with his head down.In a statement following the verdict, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch accused Tsarnaev of \"coldly and callously\" perpetrating a terrorist attack. She said no verdict can \"heal the souls of those who lost loved ones, nor the minds and bodies of those who suffered life-changing injuries.\"But she said the death penalty is a \"fitting punishment for this horrific crime\" and said she hoped the case's completion brings closure to the victims and their families.U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, who prosecuted the case, said at a news conference that the verdict was \"fair and just.\" She said Tsarnaev believed in an ideology of hate and expressed that ideology by killing and maiming Americans, noting that he will \"pay with his life.\"Vincent Lisi, the FBI special agent in charge of the case, said the bombing victims motivated and inspired the investigators every day.Tsarnaev, 21, was found guilty last month of all 30 terrorism and other charges. Of those, 17 carried the possibility of the death penalty.Jurors' deliberationsJurors were required to fill out a lengthy, complicated verdict form that asked them to make findings on 12 aggravating factors prosecutors said support a death sentence and 21 mitigating factors Tsarnaev's lawyers said instead support a sentence of life in prison.The jurors then had to weigh any mitigating factors against any aggravating ones to determine Tsarnaev's sentence.During the penalty phase of the judicial proceedings, prosecutors brushed off defense arguments that Tsarnaev was under the strong influence of his older, radicalized brother, Tamerlan, who was killed in a police shootout.They said even though he was only 19 at the time of the marathon bombing, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was old enough to know right from wrong, and he wanted to avenge U.S. wars in Iran and Afghanistan.The Boston Marathon bombing was one of the bloodiest terrorist attacks in the United States since September 11, 2001.Two pressure-cooker bombs packed with shrapnel exploded near the marathon finish line on April 15, 2013. The Tsarnaev brothers also killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer days later.Mike Eckel and Mike Richman contributed to this report from Washington.

That sentence is the maximum agreed to when Kadyrbayev pleaded guilty last year to impeding the bombing investigation.Kadyrbayev is being sentenced June 2. A message seeking comment from his attorney wasn't immediately returned Wednesday.Prosecutors said there's no evidence Kadyrbayev knew about the plot to detonate two pressure cooker bombs loaded with shrapnel near the marathon's finish line. They said he recognized Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's photo when authorities released it and he removed Tsarnaev's laptop and backpack from his dorm room at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.\"Had the defendant done the right thing, and called the police,\" Rogers said, \"the Tsarnaev brothers' murderous rampage across Cambridge and Watertown may have been prevented.\"Tsarnaev's lawyers acknowledged his role in the deadly bombings, and he was convicted of many criminal charges. A jury last month sentenced him to death.Two more of his friends -- Azamat Tazhayakov and Robel Phillipos -- have been convicted of impeding the investigation.

The older of the alleged Marathon bombers, Tamarlan Tsarnaev, started attending Friday prayers at the Islamic Society of Boston, in Cambridge, about a year-and-a-half ago.Anwar Kazmi, a member of the executive board of the Islamic Society of Boston, addresses reporters Monday. (Fred Thys/WBUR)Tsarnaev called attention to himself during one prayer service earlier this year. It happened on Jan. 18 \u2014 the Friday prayers just before Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\"The theme of the sermon was about great men like Dr. Martin Luther King, like the prophet, what drove them, their sense of mission, what we could learn from their lives and how we could be inspired by their example, and so when the person who was giving the sermon began to talk about King, [Tsarnaev] got up and objected and raised his voice, which is against the etiquette of the sermon,\" Anwar Kazmi, a board member of the Islamic Society of Boston Trust, told reporters Monday in front of the small mosque on busy Prospect Street in Cambridge.Kazmi said different people have different memories of what Tsarnaev said that day. Kazmi said some people reported Tsarnaev objected to comparing King to the prophet Mohammed. Others have reported he called the speaker a hypocrite. Kazmi said after the incident, people sat down with Tsarnaev and explained to him that he could not interrupt the sermon.\"And he seemed to understand and nothing happened after that,\" Kazmi said. \"He continued to come to the mosque even after the incident.\"Kazmi said one man remembers a positive experience with Tsarnaev. The man ran out of gas, and Tsarnaev ran over to his apartment, got a gas can, filled it up, and brought it to the man.Kazmi said Tsarnaev's younger brother, Dzhokhar, only came once to Friday prayers.\"And I have been told that on occasion, they would also come here for the dawn prayers, and that the younger one sometimes came accompanied by his older brother,\" Kazmi said. \"The younger one never came here by himself.\"Kazmi said several members of the congregation are still being interviewed by the FBI about the brothers.

Planting bombs at the Boston Marathon one year and 51 weeks ago was a senseless act,\" Clarke said.But in a counterpoint to the blunt \"it was him\" admission of her opening statement, Clarke told the jury that Tamerlan, who died four days after the bombing following a gunfight with police, had planned the attack and built the bombs.\"Tamerlan did that,\" she said. \"We need to understand who was leading and who was following.\"By shifting some of the blame to the older brother, Tsarnaev's lawyers are trying to persuade the jury, if they find the defendant guilty, to sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of parole rather than death.The jury on Monday also viewed video of Tsarnaev standing with a backpack in the crowd at the marathon's finish line minutes before the blasts that killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, 23, and 8-year-old Martin Richard.Tsarnaev is also accused of the fatal shooting of Massachusetts of Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, 26.'Wanted to Punish America'Prosecutors argued that the younger Tsarnaev shared his brother's violent ideology.\"The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahedeen, the holy warriors,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. \"He wanted to terrorize this country. He wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people.\"Chakravarty noted that evidence showed that Tsarnaev, who moved to the United States from Russia a decade before the attack, had copies of al-Qaida's \"Inspire\" magazine on his computers.\"These were political choices,\" he said of Tsarnaev's actions. \"He was making a statement, 'an eye for an eye.'\"Hours after the gunfight with police, which ended when Dzhokhar sped off in a car, running his brother over in the process, the defendant hid in a boat parked in a backyard. While there, he wrote a note suggesting the attack was an act of retribution for U.S. military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries.Monday's closing statements could be a preview of the arguments each side plans to make during the next phase of the trial, when the same jury will hear a fresh round of witness testimony before determining whether to sentence Tsarnaev to life in prison without possibility of parole, or to death.Richard's parents, William and Denise; dancer Heather Abbott, who lost both legs in the blast, and former Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis were among the people who packed the courtroom for closing arguments.The defendant sat quietly in court on Monday, dressed in a white shirt, dark jacket and no tie. He did not speak.The surveillance video viewed by the jury on Monday shows a bomb, which the defendant is charged with leaving in front of the Forum restaurant near the finish line, going off with a blinding flash, killing Richard and Lu. The jury also saw video taken by a man injured in the blast.The graphic video captures the chaos of the immediate aftermath, with one responder yelling that he was worried about the possibility of an additional blast and another voice screaming, \"We're on fire here. We're on fire.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker brother <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Martin Richard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation moved <extra_id_0> Destination United States <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin Russia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Killer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble built <extra_id_0> Artifact bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler Tamerlan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "ISIS Is Reportedly Packing Drones With Explosives NowAn unconfirmed report from Syria suggests that ISIS has started using small drones packed with explosives as weapons.The first attack was a failure, but if the report is accurate, then it signals a dangerous new terror threat.The report showed pictures of the remains of a homemade attack drone.It was apparently shot down, along with a second drone that exploded, by Kurdish YPF (\"People's Defence Units\") fighters in Syria.The caption says that both drones carried explosives, and that no YPF fighters were injured in the incident.Unlike many jihadi groups, ISIS has proven itself tech-savvy\u2014the organization is known for its use of social media, for instance.This latest development is not surprising, as it follows a long history of drone usage.In late 2014, during the battle for Kobane, ISIS started using footage taken from dronesin their propaganda videos.Around the same time, ISIS started using quadrotors for battlefield reconnaissance.A number of them, mainly DJI quadrotors, were reportedly shot down or captured by Kurdish fighters, according to a news report from December 2014.These drones were apparently used as artillery spotters, finding targets and correcting the fall or fire for mortar crews.By early this year, ISIS drones had become important enough to be targeted by U.S. airstrikes.A CENTCOM report in March mentions that \"Near Fallujah, an airstrike destroyed an ISIL remotely piloted aircraft and an ISIL vehicle.\"\"We observed it flying for approximately 20 minutes.We observed it land.We observed the enemy place it in the trunk of a car and we struck the car,\" according to Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren.Warren described the drone as \"a model airplane\" and \"commercially available, remotely piloted aircraft, really something anyone can get.\"Another ISIS drone (\"remotely piloted vehicle\") was destroyed in an airstrike in June, and a third in August.Friends of YPG YPJIn fact, ISIS tactical drones seem to be appearing all over this year.In September the Levant Front (or Jabhat al-Shamiyya) released pictures of a camera-carrying Talon drone they brought down, which they say was flown by ISIS.The X-UAV Talon is available in kit form for about $100; it is made of plywood with a six-foot wingspan and has a large fuselage compartment for cameras or other payloads.In October, Iraqi police shot down a fixed-wing ISIS drone near Ramadi.Again it was of the small, hand-launched variety, though a different model, and the Iraqis say it was photographing military units.Even al-Qaeda has released pictures and video of what is claims was a downed ISIS drone.This flurry of drone activity is a reflection of just how easy it has become to acquire and fly drones.Just as home computers were once confined to dedicated hobbyists but found a wider market, drones have broken into the mainstream with models that require no piloting or technical skills to fly.This gives ISIS access to aerial reconnaissance that would otherwise be impossible in the face of the air superiority of Syrian, Russian, and Western forces.The pictures of the ISIS attack drone were posted by a user called \"Catelyn Carrigan\" on the Facebook page of the group \"Friends of the YPG YPJ\" with the headline \"YPG Shoots Down 2 ISIS Drones.\"The location of the new pictures is given as \"Southern Koban\u00ea, Qracoezag province near the bridge.\"We received no response to queries for more information on the pictures.This would not be the first terrorist drone strike.Hamas and Hezbollah, for example, both have used fixed-wing kamikaze drones with explosive warheads, but those were larger, modified versions of military Mirsad and Ababbil drones supplied by Iran.The ISIS drones do not rely on imported military technology, but can be assembled in a garage, for cheap.Some eagled-eyed redditors believe the drone in question today is the Skwalker X7 or X8, which costs $179 for the kit.As we've recently noted, small drones make effective battlefield weapons.The Switchblade by American company AeroVironment and the Israeli Hero-30 have both proven lethal, giving a foot soldier the power to launch his own airstrike to locate and hit a target from several miles away from behind cover.These military drones boast jam-proof communications, sophisticated terminal guidance, and advanced warheads.But even a crude, home-made version might be deadly in a terrorist attack against a soft target.During the recent terror attacks in Paris, the attackers were unable to gain access to the Stade de France, which was packed with fans for a soccer game.But drones cannot be stopped by walls or fences.While they can only carry a small amount of explosive compared to a suicide bomber, they can be deployed in significant numbers, and they can be directed with great accuracy against vulnerable targets.Of course, security forces are already looking at how to mitigate the threat from small drones, and various defensive measures are already in place, from nets to electronic detectors and jammers.Commercial drones can be stopped easily enough by jamming their control frequencies, or even hacking them to take over the drone, but purpose-built attack drones will be much harder to combat.Small drones can be built for a few thousand dollars in any home workshop.3D printed drones are no longer a novelty, and how-to guides can be shared easily over the internet.It is far too late to stop this technology from proliferating.ISIS first drone attack may have failed, but it is not likely to be the last.It may be time to get serious about defending against small drones.David Hambling's new bookSwarm Troopers: How small drones

{"text": "DJI responds to drone attacks: \u201cWe have limited ability to control what people do with our products\u201dThe world\u2019s largest drone manufacturer, DJI, has issued a statement after two of their drones armed with explosives were used in an apparent assassination attempt against Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro last week.The drones in question appeared to be Matrice 600s; commercial-level UAVs intended for aerial photography and costing around $5000 each.The Venezuelan government claims that each Matrice was packed with a kilo of C4 and were intended to kill Maduro and other important Venezuelan political figures.https://www.wetalkuav.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1024x576_MP4_4439375926361635711.mp4A video of the drone exploding from media at the eventDJI spoke with Dezeen magazine and told them that \"DJI makes products purely for peaceful purposes.\"\"While we build some prudent safety and security features into our products, we have limited ability to control what people do with them.\"They stated that the overwhelming majority of DJI drone operators use their drones peacefully, and they \"deplore any use of our products to bring harm to anyone.\"\"As with any technology, if people decide to misuse our products in any way, they have to be responsible for their actions,\" they said.Two DJI Matrice 600\u2019s were seemingly used in an attack against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela last week.Who was responsible for the drone attacks and why did they fail?It is, as yet, unclear who exactly was reponsible for the attacks.One group calling themselves \u2018Soldiers in T-shirts\u2018 claimed responsibility on Twitter.Maduro alleged Venezuela\u2019s ultra-right in alliance with Colombia\u2019s ultra-right and their outgoing president, Juan Manuel Santos were behind the assassination attempt.The Venezuelan government has used the attacks as justification for a further crackdown on political opponents and have arrested at least 6 people.Neither drone ultimately made it to their intended targets.According to Venezuela\u2019s Attorney General, this was because they were deflected from reaching their intended course through protective radio emissions eminating from Venzuelan intelligence personnel (similar to drone killing devices we\u2019ve written about previously).Video footage from multiple angles since the attack suggest that one drone exploded above the soldiers on parade (causing 7 injuries) while the other crashed into the window of an apartment, causing the apartment to catch fire (this was initially reported in some outlets as the result of gas explosion).The website Bellingcat has an excellent rundown of all evidence related to the drone attack including video footage and photos from multiple angles, if you\u2019re interested.A soldier injured by the exploding drone at the Venezualan National Guard celebration parade in CaracasDespite some claims in media, it seems unlikely the government would stage an attack against itself.As the Economist noted, \"Dictators depend on projecting an image of omnipotence\u2026 in the television footage, Mr Maduro looked befuddled; the massed ranks of the National Guard broke discipline and ran off in panic.\"In essence, the attacks made Maduro look weak, not strong.False flag operations have happened throughout history but thus far, this does not appear to be one of them.Story continues on page 2", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble armed <extra_id_0> Artifact drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime assassination <extra_id_0> Victim president <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble packed <extra_id_0> Artifact Matrice <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components C4 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack kill <extra_id_0> Target Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice C4 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploding <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target Nicol\u00e1s Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument Matrice 600\u2019s <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument other <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim soldier <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploding <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target soldier <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker government <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "FBI Increases Reward for 2008 Times Square Bombing InformationNEW YORK \u2014\u00a0U.S. federal authorities on Wednesday announced an increased reward of $115,000 for information leading to the conviction of individuals responsible for the 2008 bombing in New York's Times Square.The FBI, which had offered a $65,000 reward in 2013, said it was actively pursuing several \"persons of interest,\" and has identified the origin of the explosive device's components.\"However, we're going to need more input and information from the general public if we're going to solve this case,\" Peter Tzitzis, an FBI special agent, told reporters.The bomb exploded at about 3:45 a.m. local time on March 6, 2008, at the Armed Forces Recruiting Station, a small, stand-alone building in the heart of Times Square. No one was wounded by the blast which caused only minor damage.Authorities have said a suspect on a blue Ross bicycle dismounted, placed the bomb at the recruiting station, lit the fuse and fled. The bicycle was found in a dumpster several blocks away.The suspect appeared to be working alone but could have had a lookout or a surveillance team of as many as five others, authorities said.At a press conference on Wednesday, FBI and New York Police Department officials said they believed the person who planted the device was male and that the incident was not tied to any foreign organizations.The explosion might be connected to two other New York bombings, one at the British Consulate in 2005 and another at the Mexican Consulate in 2007, the FBI said.The consulate bombs were also placed by someone on a bicycle and detonated between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m., authorities said.The explosive device used in Times Square was detonated with a time fuse and built using an ammunition can commonly found on battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, the FBI said.The announcement of the new reward came as Boston marked the second anniversary of the attack on its annual marathon that killed three people and injured 264.While no one was harmed in the Times Square incident, the FBI said the case remained a \"top priority.\"In May 2013, Gerald Koch, a self-described anarchist from Brooklyn, was jailed after refusing to testify as a witness before a federal grand jury thought to be investigating the explosion. A federal judge ordered Koch's release in January 2014.The FBI's Tzitzis said several other individuals have come forward with information and \"good progress\" was being made.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Armed Forces Recruiting Station <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Times Square <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 264 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain jailed <extra_id_0> Detainee Gerald Koch <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "On 10 January 2015, nine people were killed and more than 30 wounded when two suicide bombers blew themselves up in a crowded caf\u00e9 in Jabal Mohsen, Tripoli, Lebanon.==Events==After the first explosion, the second suicide bomber approached the Abu Imran caf\u00e9.Before he could blow himself up, 60-year-old father of seven \"Abu Ali\" Issa Khaddour rushed and tackled the bomber, and prevented many deaths.The wounded were taken to the hospital in Zgharta, as Jabal Mohsen residents were afraid that Sunni Islamist mobs would kill Alawite wounded if taken to a hospital in Tripoli.The dead were buried on January 12.The al-Qaeda affiliated terrorist group Nusra Front took responsibility for the attacks, which targeted members of the Alawite sect.It was the first suicide attack on a civilian neighbourhood in nearly a year, following a security sweep that temporarily calmed the Bab al-Tabbaneh\u2013Jabal Mohsen conflict between Sunnis and Alawites of Tripoli.Nusra claimed the attack was in revenge for the Syrian government's attacks on Sunnis in the Syrian civil war, and for a bombing of Sunni mosques that was blamed on Alawites.The interior minister of Lebanon, Nohad Machnouk, said on January 11 that the attack was carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.==Reaction==The US strongly condemned the attack.On January 11, the Qalamoun branch of the Nusra Front threatened to conduct more attacks against Jabal Mohsen and Hezbollah.On 10 April 2015, one of the men implicated in the bombings was killed by Lebanese security forces.A suicide bombing was also supposed to have taken place in another Jabal Mohsen caf\u00e9 simultaneously with the 2015 Beirut bombings on November 12, but the supposed bomber was detained.==References==", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer bombers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Jabal Mohsen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim 30 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injurer bombers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target neighbourhood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Bab al-Tabbaneh <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact claimed <extra_id_0> Communicator Nusra <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator Nohad Machnouk <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Lebanon <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim men <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer forces <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Jabal Mohsen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Place Beirut <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "(CNN) Colombia's National Liberation Army (ELN) is claiming to have carried out the car bomb attack at a police academy in Bogota last week that left at least 20 dead.In a statement, the leftist militant group said the attack was in retaliation for the government's bombings of its camps, despite a ceasefire being in place.\"Therefore, the operation carried out against said establishment and troops is legal per the 'right of war,'\" said the ELN, which reached a ceasefire agreement with the Colombian government in September 2017. However, that agreement has been tested by attacks from both sides.The group called upon the government to send a delegation to the negotiating table to continue peace talks, adding, \"War is not the future for Colombia, it is peace.\"Thursday's attack outside the Gen.

{"text": "On February 26, 1993, at 12:18 p.m., a small cell of terrorists, with links to a local radical mosque and broader Islamist terror networks, detonated approximately 1,200 pounds of explosives in a rental van in the underground parking garage at the World Trade Center. The explosion created a five-story, 150-feet-wide crater, filled with 4,000 tons of rubble, in the sub-grade levels of the towers and undermined the floor of an adjoining hotel.Hundreds of WTC tenants and visitors were trapped in elevators and on the observation deck, and thousands of others in the towers began to evacuate before first responders reached them. Within minutes, the North Tower lobby filled with thick black smoke. Reports of those trapped in the buildings soon overloaded the city\u2019s 911 system.Local, state, and federal agencies responded to the incident and contributed to what was then the largest coordinated rescue effort in New York City history. Some Port Authority of New York & New Jersey staff with specialized knowledge of the building remained in the towers to assist with the evacuation and rescue. New York City Police Department helicopters transported rescue personnel to the roof to assist in stairway evacuations of tenants on the upper floors.The general evacuation of WTC tenants took more than four hours. Rescuers checked more than 200 elevator cars\u2014freeing trapped people from 45 of them\u2014and searched each floor of the World Trade Center complex, more than eight million square feet of space. Later that evening, 28 people with medical conditions, including one woman in labor, were escorted to the roof by NYPD and airlifted to an EMS staging area.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> Place World Trade Center <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker terrorists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> Attacker small cell of terrorists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place World Trade Center <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
