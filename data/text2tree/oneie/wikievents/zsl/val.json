Social media began rumors about various deaths within the hospital caused by bacteria similar to Neisseria meningitides.Angel Sarmiento, president of Aragua Medical School, announced eight people died of the yet unidentified disease. He said it was not Ebola, meningitis, dengue or chikungunya. He added that the victims were four children and four adults.The symptoms exhibited by the dead were spots on the body that turned to boils, high fever, massive hemorrhaging stemming from smaller hemorrhagic incidents, and multi-organ failure. The disease took around 72 hours to run its course.\"We don't know what we are confronting,\" Sarmiento said. \"We don't know if it's a virus or bacteria. How can we heal what we don't know?\"However, there may not be any disease to battle. The governor of Aragua, who is also the state's leader of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, denies Sarmiento's claims, according to the Latin American Herald Tribune.Gov. Tarek el Aissami said, \"I need to start by categorically denying the existence of some virus or bacteria on the premises of the Maracay Central Hospital that is putting the lives of patients at risk.\"Aragua's governor refuted Sarmiento's claim and called them a \"terrorist matrix that has a basic purpose, which is to create alarm, anguish in Aragua's population.\" He added that the deceased died of different causes, including an old man dying of diabetes and one of the children from leukemia.\"What you are is a criminal, who, irresponsibly using your status as a doctor, launched this campaign without finding out the facts, without investigating, and in these last few hours you've caused terrible anguish among the people of Aragua,\" el Aissami said about Sarmiento.The governor called on the Attorney General's office to investigate Sarmiento.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak virus <extra_id_0> Place state <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak bacteria <extra_id_0> Place hospital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak disease <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak virus <extra_id_0> Place the Maracay Central Hospital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim patients <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak bacteria <extra_id_0> Place the Maracay Central Hospital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim patients <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "July 29, 2011 \u0097 -- When Army Pfc. Naser Jason Abdo, accused of plotting planning a deadly bombing and shooting attack on soldiers at Fort Hood, made his first appearance in court in Waco, Texas, today, he yelled the name of accused Fort Hood shooter Major Nidal Hasan.Hasan is facing the death penalty for allegedly killing 13 people and wounding more than 30 in an assault on Fort Hood in November 2009.Like Hasan, Abdo may have taken some of his inspiration from Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical American-born Islamic cleric who is among the leaders of the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). One senior U.S. official told ABC News that after Abdo was arrested at a Killeen, Texas hotel Wednesday, Abdo mentioned the name of al-Awlaki.Nidal Hasan had exchanged emails with Awlaki, according to U.S. authorities. Al-Awlaki is believed to have inspired several other terror plots in the U.S. as well, including the bungled Christmas Day underwear bombing of Northwest flight 253.According to senior law enforcement officials, when police searched Abdo's hotel room, in addition to firearms, ammunition and bomb-making materials, they also found an article from a jihadi magazine produced by al-Awlaki's organization, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.The officials told ABC News Abdo had apparently stashed in the room an article from the first issue of al Qaeda's \"Inspire\" magazine called \"How to Build a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.\"AQAP, a media-savvy affiliate of al Qaeda, has produced six issues of \"Inspire\" so far, each featuring praise for martyrs and instructional sections on firearms and explosives for the prospective terrorist.Abdo was charged Friday with the federal crime of possession of a non-registered firearm in addition to previous charges of possession of child pornography and going AWOL from his unit. As he was being led from the courtroom, he yelled out, \"Nidal Hasan!\", \"Fort Hood!\", and \"2009!\".READ: Soldier Arrested in Alleged Fort Hood PlotAbdo Went AWOL July 4Abdo, a Muslim soldier who was in the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell more than 800 miles away in Kentucky, attempted to leave the military in 2010 after protesting the U.S.'s involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.In August 2010 he told ABC News he should not have to participate in what he called an \"unjust war\".\"Any Muslim who knows his religion or maybe takes into account what his religion says can find out very clearly why he should not participate in the U.S. military,\" Abdo said then.READ: Devout Muslim Hopes to Avoid Deployment to AfghanistanThe Army approved Abdo's request to be discharged as a conscientious objector, but just days later the discharge was put on hold and he was charged with having child pornography on his government-issued computer. Military investigators had been looking at Abdo's computer files after he made \"radical statements,\" law enforcement sources told ABC News.After he was told he would face a court martial, Abdo went AWOL from Fort Campbell on July 4. Though vocal in his protestations against the mission in the Middle East, Abdo did not make any public threats against the military.But when he was discovered Wednesday, Abdo was apparently in the final planning stages of a deadly attack. He was caught in part because a wary local gun store owner called police after Abdo visited the store to buy ammunition and gunpowder. He was acting \"suspicious,\" Guns Galore owner Greg Ebert told ABC News.\"There was clearly something wrong with him,\" Ebert said. \"We made a decision to call the police and fortunately it worked out.\"After his arrest, Abdo admitted he planned to plant two bombs at a local restaurant frequented by Fort Hood soldiers and hoped to gun down any survivors of the dual blast, according to law enforcement documents obtained by ABC News.According to the documents, military officials believe the incident \"was likely isolated to the Fort Hood area and the suspect in custody, and that arrest of the suspect has mitigated any further threats related to this incident.\"Abdo's former lawyer, James M. Branum, declined to comment for an ABC News report except to say Thursday he hasn't spoken with his client \"in a long time.\"ABC News' Sarah Netter, Luis Martinez and Lee Ferran contributed to this report.Click Here for the Blotter Homepage.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker Naser Jason Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Fort Hood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact emails <extra_id_0> Participant Nidal Hasan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection searched <extra_id_0> Observer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place room <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation led <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin courtroom <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain Arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Soldier <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Fort Hood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation Went <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation Deployment <extra_id_0> Destination Afghanistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Muslim <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> EndPosition discharged <extra_id_0> Employee Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PlaceOfEmployment Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection looking <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Observer investigators <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict face <extra_id_0> Defendant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation went <extra_id_0> Transporter Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin Fort Campbell <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact protestations <extra_id_0> Communicator his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce threats <extra_id_0> Communicator Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient military <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell buy <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity gunpowder <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Giver Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact called <extra_id_0> Participant owner <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant Greg Ebert <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact call <extra_id_0> Participant We <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact say <extra_id_0> Participant ABC News <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact spoken <extra_id_0> Participant client <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place hotel <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant ABC News <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target flight 253 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument underwear <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime possession  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime AWOL <extra_id_0> Perpetrator his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime pornography <extra_id_0> Victim child <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation going  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact yelled out <extra_id_0> Communicator he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic 2009 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime AWOL <extra_id_0> Perpetrator Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protesting <extra_id_0> Target U.S <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Afghanistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrator Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack war  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> EndPosition discharge  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime pornography <extra_id_0> Perpetrator his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime AWOL <extra_id_0> Perpetrator Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack gun down <extra_id_0> Target survivors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack plant <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place restaurant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain custody <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Two drones packed with explosives reportedly flew toward Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Saturday night in what the government has described as a failed assassination attempt.Here's a look at the details:What happened?Assailants launched two drones filled with a total of more than 4 pounds of plastic explosives toward Maduro, his wife and other top Venezuelan leaders, according to the Associated Press.The attack occurred while Maduro was making a speech at a huge outdoor event in Caracas to celebrate the 81st anniversary of the country's national guard. One of the drones was set to explode above the president while the second was set to detonate in front of him, according to Interior Minister Nestor Reverol.The Venezuelan military knocked one of the drones off-course electronically. The second drone crashed into an apartment building about two blocks from where Maduro was speaking to hundreds of troops, Reverol said.Photos taken at the event showed security officers surrounding Maduro with some sort of large black shields as they escorted him away.\"That drone came after me,\" Maduro said. \"But there was a shield of love that always protects us. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll live for many more years.\"Who launched the drone attack?The Venezuelan government alleges that Maduro's political opponents conspired with individuals in Miami and Bogota, Colombia, to try to kill Maduro. They have so far offered no real proof to support this claim, and opposition leaders charge that Maduro is using the attack as an excuse to crack down on his critics.Government authorities said Sunday that they have detained six people \u2013 whom they described as \"terrorists and assassins\" \u2013 in connection with the attack. Among those detained: a man who took part in 2014 protests against the government and a man who had a warrant out for his arrest for attacking a military barracks.Maduro accused the \u201cfar right,\u201d working with conspirators in Miami and Bogota \u2013including Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos \u2013 of launching the attack. Colombia\u2019s government has denied any role in the violence.Maduro, who accuses the U.S. of supporting his opponents, called on President Donald Trump to hold the \"terrorist group\" accountable.John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, said Sunday he would like to see solid evidence to support Maduro's claims.\"If the government of Venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of U.S. criminal law, we\u2019ll take a serious look at it,\" Bolton said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"What is the political and economic situation in Venezuela?Venezuela is in the midst of an economic crisis that has been described as worse than the Great Depression that devastated the United States and much of the rest of the world in the 1930s.The inflation rate is set to hit a stunning 13,000 percent this year. There are shortages of food and medicine and a soaring crime rate, spurring refugees to flee into neighboring countries. More than 600,000 Venezuelans have crossed into Colombia, and Brazil has declared a state of emergency because of all the Venezuelans sweeping into that nation.Maduro is viewed by the United States and other democratic countries as a corrupt, left-wing dictator who imposes strict controls on his people and on the press. He won re-election to a six-year term in May, but the process was widely viewed as a rigged farce.The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Venezuela immediately after the election in an effort to stop Maduro from selling off government debt to enrich himself.What could happen next?Reverol said there could be more arrests. Critics fear an even greater government crackdown on Maduro's political opponents.\"The investigation will get to the bottom of this,\" Maduro said. \"No matter who falls.\"More:Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says drone attack was 'attempt to kill me'More:Venezuelan opposition leaders taken from their homes by state security agents", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Crash crashed <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> CrashObject building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flew <extra_id_0> Vehicle drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation launched <extra_id_0> Transporter Assailants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact speech <extra_id_0> Communicator Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation escorted <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transporter they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack kill <extra_id_0> Target Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain detained <extra_id_0> Jailer authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee whom <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protests <extra_id_0> Topic the government <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrator who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacking <extra_id_0> Attacker who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target barracks <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassination  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand called <extra_id_0> Recipient Donald Trump <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flee <extra_id_0> Destination countries <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact refugees <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation crossed <extra_id_0> Destination Colombia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack kill <extra_id_0> Target me <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain taken <extra_id_0> Detainee opposition leaders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer state <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "By MARI YAMAGUCHI, Associated PressTOKYO (AP) \u2014 Japanese police have arrested a man who admitted to landing a drone with low-level radioactive sand on the roof of the prime minister's office to protest the government's nuclear energy policy, officials said Saturday.Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto, 40, turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan.The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices, the prime ministers' office has said. The infiltration at Japan's political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there.No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident.Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister's office. He has not been indicted and faces further questioning.Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government's nuclear energy policy.Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan's 48 reactors, which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami-triggered Fukushima plant disaster. Abe's administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible.The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium, levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment.The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima, where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai-ichi meltdowns, NHK said.The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities. Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial, service and entertainment use. At a meeting Friday, task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones.It is not clear exactly when the drone landed because workers at the office in central Tokyo rarely go up to the roof. An official taking new employees on a building tour reportedly spotted the drone.A blog with an anti-nuclear theme managed under the name \"Kantei (prime minister's office) Santa\" contained photos of a drone that looked like the one found Wednesday. In one entry, the anonymous writer said he drove from his hometown in Obama city in Fukui to Tokyo and flew the drone in the early hours of April 9, trying to have it land in the yard of the prime minister's office, but that he eventually lost track of the device.In the United States in January, a drone flown by an off-duty intelligence employee crashed on the White House grounds.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Jailer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize found <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Crash crashed  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak disaster  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Yamamoto <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer Police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime obstructing duties  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Instrument unmanned aerial devices <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "HOUSTON \u2013 A 26-year-old man has been sentenced to federal prison following his conviction for attempting to maliciously damage property receiving federal financial assistance, announced U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick. Andrew Schneck pleaded guilty March 27, 2018.Today, U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. handed Schneck a 78-month sentence to be immediately followed by three years of supervised release. The court also imposed a $10,000 fine.On the evening of Aug. 19, 2017, a Houston park ranger observed Schneck kneeling among the bushes in front of the General Dowling Monument located in Hermann Park in Houston. Schneck was holding two small boxes with various items inside to include what appeared to be duct tape and wires. After placing the boxes on the ground per the ranger\u2019s request, Schneck took a drink of clear liquid from a plastic bottle, spit it out and poured the remainder on the ground. The ranger then noticed a timer and wires in the box and notified the Houston Police Department (HPD).The HPD Bomb Squad tested the clear liquid and a white powdery substance found in a small, black aluminum tube which revealed they were nitroglycerin and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), respectively. HMTD is a high explosive organic compound used as an initiating, or primary, explosive. Nitroglycerin is used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of explosives. ln its pure form, nitroglycerin is a contact explosive with physical shock causing it to explode and which degrades over time to even more unstable forms. Nitroglycerin is highly dangerous to transport or use.The FBI Explosive Unit Laboratory examined the items in Schneck\u2019s possession on Aug. 19 and determined them to comprise a fully functioning improvised explosive device.Schneck has been and will remain in custody pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.The FBI and HPD conducted the investigation.

The republic is also famed for its ethnic and linguistic diversity, being home to more than 30 languages.Several dozen Muslim peoples have settled among the high valleys over the centuries.image copyright AFP image caption Villages cling to steep hillsides in Dagestan's spectacular mountainous interiorThe Avars form the largest ethnic group and account for about a fifth of the population. A further substantial proportion is made up of Dargins, Kumyks and Lezgins. About 10 per cent are ethnic Russians. There are also Laks, Tabasarans and Nogai, to name but a few of the other significant groups.The republic's constitution declares the protection of the interests of all of Dagestan's peoples to be a fundamental principle. It is a delicate balance to maintain, in what is Russia's most ethnically diverse province.The republic has oil and gas reserves and also the fisheries potential offered by a share in the resources of the Caspian sea. However, it is prey to organized crime and regional instability. The crime barons may prosper but the people are amongst the poorest in Russia.HistoryDagestan was the birth place of Imam Shamil, the legendary fighter who in the 19th century spearheaded fierce resistance by tribesmen of Chechnya and Dagestan to the spread of the Russian empire. His name is still revered by many in both republics.image copyright AFP image caption Federal troops were deployed to repel incursions by Chechen militants in the 1990sWhen the Bolsheviks sought to enforce control in the Caucasus in the early 1920s, Dagestan became an autonomous Soviet republic within the Russian Federation. During the Stalinist period, its peoples escaped the mass deportation inflicted on their Chechen neighbours and many others.After the fall of the Soviet Union, the republic's authorities stayed loyal to Russia, but the region became infamous for its lawlessness and corruption. Organised crime is reported to flourish and kidnappings and violence are commonplace. Firearms are ubiquitous and assassinations are a regular event.Moscow blames much of this on Chechen-based separatism, but others say lust for profit, combined with a gun culture, is the root cause.Budennovsk and beyondIn the 1990s, separatist warlords from neighbouring Chechen openly led armed operations in Dagestan on several occasions.

{"text": "New York Gov.Andrew Cuomo (D) said Sunday that there is \u201cno evidence of an international terrorism connection\u201d in the explosion in Chelsea, though he stopped short of saying whoever caused the incident did not want to incite terror.AD\u201cIt depends on your definition of terrorism,\u201d Cuomo said.\u201cA bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism, but it\u2019s not linked to international terrorism.In other words, we find no ISIS connections.\u201dADHe said later: \u201cThis is the nightmare scenario.\u201dNot long after the blast, police said they had found another possible explosive device just blocks away.This device appeared to be similar to a pressure cooker and had wiring on it, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation.Pressure cookers were used in the two bombs detonated at the Boston Marathon in 2013.The bomb squad safely removed the second device, New York police tweeted early Sunday.Police officers, firefighters and other first responders had rushed to the scene of the blast, which closed a major roadway and forced people out of nearby buildings.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said Sunday that the explosion was \u201cintentional,\u201d but noted that few details were available because the investigation was in its early stages.\u201cWe know there was a bombing,\u201d de Blasio said.\u201cWe know it was a very serious incident, but we have a lot more work to do to be able to say what kind of motivation was behind this.\u201dADADHe also echoed his comments from Saturday night that there was no specific, credible threat against New York from any terrorist group.The FBI and NYPD are trying to understand what motivation lay behind the blast.\u201cWe will look at individuals.We will look at associations.We will look at social media,\u201d William Sweeney, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI New York Field Office, said.\u201cUntil we have that information it is not fair for us to give a conclusion [as to motivation],\u201d DeBlasio said.\u201cLet the law enforcement experts draw the conclusions.\u201dPolice Commissioner James O\u2019Neill, whose first day in the position was Saturday, told reporters on Sunday that police were still gathering evidence.AD\u201cWe did find some components indicative of an IED\u2026 that went off intentionally,\u201d O\u2019Neill said.Late Saturday, police had ruled out natural gas as a possible cause of the blast.ADThe New York Police Department\u2019s counterterrorism bureau responded to the explosion, along with officials with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.While O\u2019Neill said authorities were still trying to determine what, precisely, exploded, the NYPD counterterrorism bureau posted a photo online earlier Saturday showing what appeared to be a dumpster or garbage container mangled by a blast:Police in New York also reported shortly after 11 p.m. that they had found the \u201cpossible secondary device\u201d a few blocks away from the Chelsea explosion scene, on 27th Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues.Police directed people away from that intersection, and one officer could be heard telling pedestrians that \u201cthere is a possible explosive\u201d in the area.ADNot long after midnight, police said in a statement that they were asking people in the area of this potential explosive to move away from their windows \u201cuntil we clear the suspicious package,\u201d although officers did not fully evacuate the area.ADAccording to the Associated Press, the second device was removed with a robot and taken to the department firing range in the Bronx.O\u2019Neill said Sunday that two \u201cvery dedicated\u201d former New York state troopers had responded to the initial report of the blast last night.In a search for other explosives, they had parked their vehicle on 27th Street.Walking down the block, they found the second, unexploded device, O\u2019Neill said.ADReports of another suspicious package at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue turned out to be a false alarm \u2014 the package was only garbage, J. Peter Donald, a police spokesman, posted on Twitter around 12:30 a.m. Sunday.The Chelsea explosion occurred about 11 hours after a pipe bomb exploded in a Jersey Shore garbage can, shortly before a scheduled charity 5K race there benefiting Marines and Navy sailors.ADAuthorities have said they have not yet found anything connecting the Chelsea and New Jersey incidents but are continuing to investigate.On Sunday, Cuomo said the \u201cbombs\u201d in Chelsea \u201cappear to be different\u201d from those discovered earlier in the day in New Jersey, though the devices from both states were being shipped to the FBI lab in Quantico for further assessment.He said the devices in New Jersey were \u201cpipe bombs,\u201d and those in Chelsea were not.Cuomo said agents in New York were in touch with those in New Jersey.ADCuomo said officials \u201chave no reason to believe at this time that there is any further immediate threat,\u201d though the National Guard and the New York State Police were deploying an additional 1,000 personnel to bus terminals, airports and subways \u201cjust to err on the side of caution.\u201dADCuomo said the blast in Chelsea \u201ccaused significant property damage,\u201d though he a nearby subway station was structurally safe.He said law enforcement would work diligently to identify and locate those responsible.\u201cWhoever placed these bombs, we will find, and they will be brought to justice,\u201d Cuomo said.The explosion in the area of 23rd Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues occurred about 8:30 p.m. police said.Several of those injured were brought to area hospitals, Donald, the police spokesman, posted on Twitter.ADAll victims were treated and released by Sunday morning, Cuomo said.A spokeswoman for Lenox Health Greenwich Village, which treated nine of the victims, said patients were treated for minor injuries that included lacerations to the head and body.Other hospitals declined to provide specifics about the extent of patients\u2019 injuries from the explosion.ADPhotos and accounts posted on social media Saturday night showed large crowds \u2014 as well as a large law enforcement presence \u2014 in the area near where the explosion occurred.Soleil Filomena, 64, was leaving a convenience store at Seventh Avenue and 23rd Street when she heard the explosion.\u201cIt was so loud it just went through my whole body,\u201d she said.\u201cPeople started running up 23rd Street, and I started running with them.\u201dADFilomena said she saw a \u201cbig black cloud in the sky.\u201d After the explosion, she said her \u201cear was ringing for 15 minutes.\u201dWhen Keith Salomon of Delaware felt the explosion, he was having dinner a block and a half from the site of the blast.His chair and table shook, he said, and he saw people being taken away in ambulances.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know what it was and so, at first, we just kept eating,\u201d said Salomon, 52, who was visiting his son in the city.\u201cBut then we realized something was wrong.\u201dOthers did not hear the explosion but saw the aftermath.When Jacob Schulman left his apartment a few blocks away shortly before 9 p.m., he saw people running and screaming.AD\u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going on, but everyone looked so panicked.I started running.too,\u201d said Schulman, 26, who has lived in the neighborhood since 2014.Two blocks from the blast scene, a group of people emerged from a screening of the animated movie \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d and saw the flashing lights.One man who came out of the theater said he could not hear anything and had no idea about the explosion not far from where he was sitting.President Obama was briefed on the situation in New York and will be updated as more information becomes available, a White House official said late Saturday.Speaking in Colorado not long after the explosion, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump quickly commented on the situation before much information was known.\u201cI must tell you that just before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Trump shortly after getting off of his plane.His comments were made before authorities confirmed the nature of the explosion.Late Saturday, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said it was important to \u201cknow the facts\u201d before drawing conclusions about such incidents.Early Sunday, posts on social media from people in New York showed the area of the explosion to be relatively calm and quiet.Authorities had closed large swaths of roads in the area Saturday night.On Sunday, several roads had reopened but there remained a large police presence in the area.The explosion in New York comes as foreign leaders, including many heads of state, are heading to Manhattan for the United Nations General Assembly.Secretary of State John F. Kerry arrived Saturday, while Obama is scheduled to head to the city on Monday.This annual meeting \u2014 held more than two miles from the site of the explosion in Chelsea \u2014 is traditionally a challenging time for New York, as many roads are shut down and the heavy security leads to traffic jams.The FBI still has no determination as to motive, said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.Agents are examining the detonated material from the first device as well as studying the second, which appeared to resemble a pressure cooker.They are also looking at video from security cameras, social media \u2014 \u201call the logical leads,\u201d the official said.The explosion in Chelsea coincided with a separate attack that took place in Minnesota Saturday night, in which a man stabbed eight people in a St.Cloud mall before he was killed by an off-duty police officer.On Sunday, an ISIS-linked news agency claimed the mall attacker was \u201ca soldier of the Islamic State.\u201dAn FBI spokesman said in an emailed statement that the agency had not determined whether the stabbings were related to the bombing in Manhattan the same night.Speaking to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday morning, New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie (R) said there were no known links so far between the incident in New Jersey and those in New York and Minnesota.Authorities urged any witnesses with tips, video or other credible information about the explosion to call 1-800-577-TIPS.Berman and Wang reported from Washington.Renae Merle in New York

{"text": "Defense Admits Suspect's Guilt in Boston Marathon BombingThe defense lawyer for suspected Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told the jury at his trial Wednesday that he helped carry out the deadly 2013 attack, but contended that Tsarnaev's older brother was the mastermind behind the plot.\"It was him,\" attorney Judy Clarke said of her client, who is facing the death penalty if convicted of setting off a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs, packed with nails and ball bearings, at the finish line of the annual race in 2013 that killed three people and injured another 264.Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to the 30 counts against him, including the fatal shooting of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer days after the bombings as the Tsarnaevs tried to flee.Clarke, one of the U.S.'s foremost death penalty legal specialists, told jurors on the first day of the trial the defense will not \"sidestep\" Tsarnaev's guilt.Influence of older brotherBut she claimed that he was deeply influenced by his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, to carry out the attack, which a prosecutor alleged was aimed at avenging U.S. wars in Muslim countries.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev inadvertently killed his brother, running over him with a car, as they attempted to elude police days after authorities had identified them as suspects in the bombings.In this courtroom sketch, defense attorney Judy Clarke is depicted delivering opening statements in front of U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr., on the first day of the federal death penalty trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, March 4, 2015, in Boston.\"It was Tamerlan Tsarnaev who self-radicalized,\" Clarke said. \"It was Dzhokhar who followed him. The evidence will show that Tamerlan planned and orchestrated and enlisted his brother into this series of horrific acts.\"In blaming the older brother, Clarke's strategy appeared aimed at sparing the 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev from the death penalty. If Tsarnaev is convicted, the jury will decide whether he is executed or gets life in prison without the possibility of parole.The approach set up an immediate conflict with U.S. District Judge George O'Toole, who had ruled that the question of the relative culpability of the two brothers was best left to the trial's second phase, once Dzhokhar's guilt has been established.\u201cSome evidence of the brother's interactions will be inevitable,\u201d O'Toole allowed in brief remarks before the trial opened. But he interrupted Clarke multiple times to warn her against going too deep into family history.Defense lawyers had fought up to the last minute to have the trial moved out of Massachusetts, arguing the emotional impact of the bombings ran too deep and too many people had personal connections to the case. Their requests were rejected by O'Toole and a federal appeals court.Prosecutors lay out caseIn his opening statement, U.S. prosecutor William Weinreb accused the younger Tsarnaev of detonating bombs designed to \"tear people apart and create a bloody spectacle.\"Weinreb described the two homemade pressure cooker bombs used in the attack as the type \"favored by terrorists\" because of the mayhem and injuries they could cause. After the blasts, he said, \"The air was filled with the smell of burning sulfur and people's screams.\"Watch video from VOA's Carolyn Presutti:Video sizewidthxheightpixelsDefense Concedes Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Carried Out Boston Marathon BombingsShare this video0:02:20\u25b60:00:00/0:02:20\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 5.6MB360p | 7.7MB720p | 51.3MBThe prosecutor said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev \"believed that he was a soldier in a holy war against Americans.\" Weinreb said Tsarnaev \"also believed that by winning that victory, he had taken a step toward reaching paradise. That was his motive for committing these crimes.\"The shaggy-haired Tsarnaev stared straight ahead, avoiding looking at the jury, as the prosecutor spoke.Victims at trialMore than 20 victims of the blasts watched the early moments of the trial, taking up the entire left-hand side of the courtroom.Two dramatically different portraits of the former college student are expected to emerge during the trial.Was he a submissive, adoring younger brother who only followed directions given by his older, radicalized brother? Or was he a willing, active participant in the attacks?The brothers are ethnic Chechens who had lived in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and the volatile Dagestan region of Russia before coming to the U.S. with their parents and two sisters about a decade before the bombings.Some material for this report came from Reuters and AP.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack Bombing <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize suspected <extra_id_0> IdentifiedRole bomber <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 264 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shooting <extra_id_0> Target officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer brother <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize identified <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject them <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Identifier authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifiedRole suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt jury <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ReleaseParole parole <extra_id_0> Defendant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt jury <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain gets life in prison <extra_id_0> Detainee he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Prosecutor William Weinreb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonating <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Instrument they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime mayhem  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack Bombings <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crimes  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Prosecutors Push Death Sentence for Boston Bomber TsarnaevNearly two weeks after convicting accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev of all 30 charges against him, jurors Tuesday heard reasons he should be put to death.U.S. prosecutors showed the 12-member jury a photo of Tsarnaev giving the middle finger to a surveillance camera the day of his first court appearance in 2013.\"This is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini. \"Unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged.\"The 21-year-old, an ethnic Chechen U.S. immigrant-turned-citizen, was found guilty of working with his older brother, Tamerlan, to carry out the April 15, 2013 attack. The twin pressure cooker bombs they set off killed three people and wounded 264. The two brothers also fatally shot a police officer as they tried to elude a massive police manhunt. The elder Tsarnaev was killed days after the bombings during their attempted escape.The court Tuesday was shown large photos of the four dead victims.\"They were all beautiful, and they're all now gone,\" said Pellegrini. She described the killings as \"unbearable, indescribable, inexcusable and senseless,\" labeling the younger Tsarnaev \"America's worst nightmare.\"Witnesses who lost limbs or loved ones in the bombings also were called to the stand, recounting the horror of the attack.Jurors must now determine whether Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death or life in prison. The penalty phase of the trial could last a month. If the jury does not agree unanimously on a death sentence, a life without parole sentence will be imposed automatically.Tsarnaev's attorneys, pushing for life behind bars, have argued that his radicalized older brother was the driving force behind the attack, and that Dzhokhar played a secondary role out of a sense of sibling loyalty.Some survivors and the parents of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who died in the attack, also have lobbied publicly against a death sentence.\"We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty,\" Bill and Denise Richard wrote in an essay in The Boston Globe last week, \"but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong the most painful day of our lives.\"Over the past 15 years, only three people have been put to death by the federal government - Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, drug smuggler Juan Raul Garza and kidnapper Louis Jones. Tsarnaev's lawyers acknowledged from the start of the federal trial that he was involved in the plot to detonate the bombs. But defense attorney Judy Clarke, who has successfully kept other notorious U.S. murder convicts off death row, told the jury at the end of the first phase of the trial, \"If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened.\"The elder Tsarnaev died after being shot by police and inadvertently driven over by Dzhokhar as the two brothers attempted to flee the Boston area.Dzhokhar was later found hiding in a boat parked in the backyard of a suburban Boston home. Prosecutors say he scrawled a motive for the attack on the inside wall of the boat, writing that the brothers were trying to avenge American attacks on Muslims in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Sentence Sentence <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt Prosecutors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant Bomber Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicting <extra_id_0> Defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact heard <extra_id_0> Participant jurors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Topic Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Participant U.S <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact showed <extra_id_0> Participant jury <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker 21-year-old <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim 264 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die shot <extra_id_0> Victim officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer brothers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation elude  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation escape  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact described <extra_id_0> Participant She <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Martin Richard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die death <extra_id_0> Victim Louis Jones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shot <extra_id_0> Attacker police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack driven over <extra_id_0> Attacker Dzhokhar <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flee <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact brothers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin area <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact wrote <extra_id_0> Participant Denise Richard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic death penalty <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Pellegrini <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

MUST WATCH Mailbox might have saved this man's life 03:13-- One was housed in a pressure cooker hidden inside a backpack, the FBI said.The device also had fragments that may have included nails, BBs and ball bearings, the agency said.-- The second bomb was in a metal container, but it was unclear whether it was in a pressure cooker as well, the FBI said.-- Photos obtained by CNN show the remains of a pressure cooker found at the scene, along with a shredded black backpack and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings.-- They were sent to the FBI's national laboratory in Virginia, where technicians will try to reconstruct the devices.-- In the past, the U.S. government has warned federal agencies that terrorists could turn pressure cookers into bombs by packing them with explosives and shrapnel, and detonating them with blasting caps.-- Authorities sifted through thousands of pieces of evidence and a mass of digital photos and video clips.They have pleaded for the public's help in providing additional leads and images.The casualtiesThe blasts left three people dead.-- Martin Richard , an 8-year-old boy with a gap-tooth grin and bright eyes.He loved to run and play in his yard.-- Krystle Campbell , a 29-year-old freckle-faced woman described as having \"a heart of gold.\"-- The third victim was Lingzu Lu , a graduate student at Boston University, who had moved to the city last fall, making friends and soaking up new experiences.-- Of the approximately 178 people injured, 66 remain in area hospitals, according to the latest CNN tally.Thirteen of those are still in critical condition, hospital officials said.- Martin's mother and sister are among the wounded.His mother underwent surgery for a brain injury, and his 6-year-old sister lost her leg.The injuries-- Doctors say dozens of victims suffered injuries to their legs that involve blood vessels, bone and tissue.-- The bombings resulted in at least 13 amputations and left doctors picking ball bearings out of victims in the emergency room, a terrorism expert briefed on the investigation said.-- Dr. George Velmahos, head of trauma care at Massachusetts General Hospital, said his team found \"numerous\" metal pellets and nails inside patients' bodies.\"There are people who have 10, 20, 30, 40 of them in their body, or more,\" Velmahos said.-- Dr. Ron Walls also said one patient had more than 12 carpenter-type nails.\"There is no question some of these objects were implanted in the device for the purpose of being exploded forward,\" he said.Terror group links-- While the clues moved the investigation forward, it is still unclear whether the attack was an act of domestic or foreign terrorism.-- No connection has been made to any terrorist group or individual.-- President Barack Obama described the bombings as an act of terrorism, but said it is unclear whether they were the work of a group or \"a malevolent individual.\"-- The Pakistani Taliban has said it was not involved in the attack.-- Authorities don't have a sense of what the motive is, an official said.-- The FBI asked the public to report anyone who talked about targeting the marathon or showed interest in explosives.The agency urged anyone who might have heard explosions in remote areas -- possibly by someone testing a bomb -- or seen someone carrying \"an unusually heavy, dark-colored bag\" around the time of the attack to come forward.'Possible' suspectsThree days later, authorities have yet to make an arrest, but have made \"significant progress,\" a law enforcement official said.-- Investigators have pinpointed two men of \"high interest\" as possible suspects after they appeared in images near the finish line moments before the blasts, a law enforcement official said.-- One of the men is seen carrying a black backpack.-- Authorities had not yet named the two, but their photographs have been distributed to law enforcement, a source said.-- Earlier Wednesday, two sources with knowledge of the investigation identified a man as a possible suspect in the attack, but did not name him.-- Seen on a video, the man wore a white baseball cap.One of the sources added that the cap was on backwards and the man was also wearing a light-colored hooded sweatshirt and a black jacket.-- It was not immediately clear if he is one of those alluded to in the photographs distributed to law enforcement officials.-- Investigators are closer to cracking the case \"every hour,\" Massachusetts Gov.Deval Patrick said.He urged patience with the probe to allow investigators space to do their job.-- \"I wish they had nailed the perpetrator within minutes of this catastrophe, but I understand from experience it's going to take some time,\" he said.The Investigation-- Significant progress has been made in the investigation, but there has been no arrest, the FBI told CNN.-- After sources told CNN on Wednesday that an arrest had been made, sources with the Department of Justice and Boston Police Department each said that no arrest had been made.-- A source with Boston law enforcement said, \"We got him,\" but would not clarify whether that meant an identification had been made or an arrest carried out.-- Some federal sources said that it would be going too far to say even that an identification had been made, but several sources in Boston disputed that, saying a clear identification had been made.-- Investigators believe they have identified a suspect in the marathon bombings, a source who has been briefed on the investigation told CNN's John King.The possible breakthrough came from an analysis of video from a Lord and Taylor department store near the site of the second blast, and video from a Boston TV station helped as well, the official said.-- As they scramble to search for suspects, authorities are processing \"the most complex crime scene that we have dealt with in the history of our department,\" said Ed Davis, the Boston police commissioner.-- Forensic specialists and dogs trained to detect explosive devices and their residue were at the scene of the blasts.A command post has been created, with 1,000 officers conducting interviews and gathering details.-- Authorities have received 2,000 tips from around the world, said Richard DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office.\"Someone knows who did this,\" he said.Security elsewhere-- Cities have stepped up security after the attacks, including Washington, New York, Miami, Chicago, Atlanta and Los Angeles.-- British police said they are reviewing the security plan for the London Marathon scheduled for Sunday.The marathon will observe 30 seconds of silence and is urging runners to wear a black ribbon to mark the Boston tragedy.Reaction-- \"Boston is not going to be intimidated by this,\" said Secretary of State John Kerry, a former U.S. senator from Massachusetts.\"But we are going to find out who did this.The police work being done is extraordinary.The FBI is remarkable.There is a great deal of forensic evidence.We are hopeful we can bring people to justice.\"\"The Islamic Republic condemns killing of innocent people in U.S. Boston, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria in equal measure,\" Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Wednesday, according to a report on state-run Press TV.Tributes-- Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will travel to Boston on Thursday for an 11 a.m. interfaith service dedicated to the victims.The president is expected to meet with the families of those wounded or killed.--Obama declared an emergency in Massachusetts and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1>

{"text": "(CNN) A federal appeals court ruled on Friday to vacate the death sentence of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , who along with his brother planted homemade bombs near the finish of the 2013 Boston Marathon, killing three spectators and injuring hundreds.The court also ruled to set aside three of his 30 convictions but said he will remain in federal prison for the rest of his life.The court ruled Tsarnaev should be given a new penalty phase trial, where a new set of jurors can again decide if he should be sentenced to death.Tsarnaev, now 27, will remain incarcerated and is being held at the nation's most secure federal prison in Florence, Colorado.\"And just to be crystal clear: Because we are affirming the convictions (excluding the three ... convictions) and the many life sentences imposed on those remaining counts (which Dzhokhar has not challenged), Dzhokhar will remain confined to prison for the rest of his life, with the only question remaining being whether the government will end his life by executing him,\" the opinion, authored by Circuit Court Judge Ojetta Rogeriee Thompson, says.Tsarnaev was convicted in 2015, including for the deaths of Krystle Campbell Lingzi Lu at the marathon and police officer Sean Collier, separately.Around-the-clock coverageTsarnaev's legal team had pushed to change the venue of the trial to a courthouse that wasn't so close to the site of the bombing, in the heart of a town so affected by the tragedy.The appeals court judges agreed, saying, \"One could not turn on the radio either without hearing something about these stunningly sad events.\"The appeals judges ruled that US District Court Judge George O'Toole, who oversaw Tsarnaev's trial, \"fell short\" of his promise to question jurors thoroughly enough to identify the degree to which they had been exposed to facts of the case through media coverage, \"providing sufficient ground to vacate his death sentences.\"Part of the appeals court's ruling was a decision to reverse three convictions for charges that Tsarnaev was carrying a firearm in connection with his possession of a pressure cooker bomb.The ruling tells the district court to enter judgments of acquittal on those charges, put together a new jury and preside over a new trial that strictly focuses on what penalty Tsarnaev should receive for the counts that are eligible for the death penalty.Tsarnaev's attorneys had filed a post-trial motion for judgments of acquittal on these convictions that the district court judge denied.CNN has reached out to Tsarnaev's legal team for comment on the ruling.The ruling also states that the judges make no judgment about whether Boston is a \"proper venue\" for a sentencing retrial, and says it is a decision that should be left to the US District Court for Massachusetts, where the initial trial was held.The US Attorney's office said: \"We are currently reviewing the opinion and are declining further comment at this time.\"Tsarnaev was 19 years old when he and his brother, Tamerlan, who was 26 years old at the time, went to Boston's Boylston Street shortly before 3 p.m. on April 15, 2013, to carry out their plotSurveillance video showed the brothers carrying the pressure cooker bombs in backpacks and moving through the crowd near the marathon finish line in what federal prosecutors called a coordinated attack.Tamerlan set off the first bomb, a 6-quart pressure cooker that contained gunpowder, nails and BBs, prosecutors said.The bomb killed Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager, and permanently injured several other people who lost their legs.The second pressure cooker bomb, carried in by Dzhokhar, went off 12 seconds later and killed two people, Martin and Lu, a graduate student from China.The bombings sparked a manhunt for days that shut down the city and resulted in wall-to-wall coverage of the search.The brothers, while on the run, killed Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier.After they stole an SUV, the two were chased by police.Tamerlan died in an explosive firefight with police in nearby Watertown.Dzhokhar was arrested a day later.Victims, families to relive another trialThe decision to order a new trial will be difficult for the families of victims, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said after the decision came down on Friday.\"I think the concern that some families have had from the very beginning was that this day was going to come, where they would have to relive another trial, and you know they shouldn't have to relive another trial,\" Walsh said.\"The only thing that I'll say is a positive ... this guy will never see the light of day again.He's going to live within those four walls.He got exactly what he deserved.\"Shortly after Tsarnaev was found guilty on all counts, the parents of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was killed in the bombing, publicly pleaded for prosecutors not to pursue the death sentence in the penalty phase of the trial.\"We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring,\" the parents wrote in a column in The Boston Globe.\"As long as the defendant is in the spotlight, we have no choice but to live a story told on his terms, not ours.The minute the defendant fades from our newspapers and TV screens is the minute we begin the process of rebuilding our lives and our family.\"CNN has reached out to the Richard family for comment on Friday's ruling.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentence

school last year to serve four years of \"intensely supervised\" probation Wednesday.Martin Farnsworth appears in 5th District Court via video conference for his initial appearance, St.George, Utah, July 31, 2018 | File photo via court pool, St.George NewsMartin Farnsworth, 17, appeared in 5thDistrict Court Wednesday afternoon where Judge Michael Westfall sentenced him to serve 48 months of supervised probation and 250 hours of community service, along with additional restrictions.Farnsworth had been facing a potential five years-to-life prison term that came with the first-degree felony charge of attempting to injure others with an incendiary device that he pleaded guilty to last month as a part of a plea deal.Prior to taking the plea, Farnsworth faced felony charges for attempted murder and possession of a weapon of mass destruction.The case was originally set in juvenile court last year but was moved to 5th District Court where he was tried as an adult due to the severity of the incident involved.Read more: Judge: 16-year-old who brought bomb to Pine View High School will be tried as adultThe charges stem from a March 5, 2018 incident in which Farnsworth took a homemade explosive to Pine View High School.He placed the would-be incendiary device in a backpack in the cafeteria area during lunch and left after lighting a fuse.At the time, the cafeteria contained between 75-150 students.Pine View High School students are evacuated to the football field as police investigate a bomb scare inside the school and swept the parking lot as a precaution, St.George, Utah, March 5, 2018 | File photo by Mori Kessler, St.George NewsStudents noticed smoke coming from the backpack that contained the device and reported it to school faculty and the school\u2019s resource officer, triggering an evacuation of the school and a multi-agency response from law enforcement.While the incendiary device\u2019s fuse fizzled out and failed to ignite, investigators determined that if it had gone off, it would have caused damage to the immediate area and injured those near it.The device was constructed out of a \"metal soup can filled with metal BB shots removed from shot gun shells,\" according to court documents.It also included \"three canning lids with masking tape, BBs, an improvised fuse, black gun powder, white plastic cup, empty box of box-strike matches, three 16.9 oz.water bottles of gasoline\" and other items.Investigators found that Farnsworth learned to make an incendiary device via online instructions believed to be connected to the Islamic State terror group, according to court records and testimony.Public defender Edward Flint said he was pleased with the sentence in the Martin Farnsworth case, as getting his client released from further incarceration and placed on probation was a primary goal, St.George, Utah, April 24, 2019 | Photo by court pool, St.George NewsEdward Flint, Farnsworth\u2019s attorney, said that building the incendiary device and attempting to use it were a response to bullying his client had received at school and he finally snapped.The result was a criminal act, he added.\"The way life is going, it\u2019s not going well,\" Farnsworth said in a recording of a police interview after he was taken into custody.\"There\u2019s a bunch of bad people.I don\u2019t like the way the world is going.I just wanted to do something to make it different.\"Read more: \u2018If someone got hurt, I probably wouldn\u2019t care\u2019; Teen charged with attempted murder in Pine View High bomb scare\"He feels guilt and remorse, yes, but differently,\" Flint said, referring to Farnsworth being diagnosed with a mild, yet high-functioning form of autism and severe depression.The diagnosis was made by a mental health expert as a part of an evaluation connected to the pre-sentencing report.Read more: Defense in Pine View bombing case says Washington County School District failed teenFlint said the severe depression was a result of the bullying.The perceived lack of empathy on Farnsworth\u2019s part over what he\u2019d done was also a sign of autism spectrum disorder, and not necessary a sign the teen didn\u2019t regret was he had done.\"He\u2019s a model citizen and a good person all around \u2013 but he snapped,\" Flint said.Deputy Washington County Attorney Angela Adams addresses the court in regard to the sentencing of Martin Farnsworth, St.George, Utah, April 24, 2019 | Photo by Court Pool, St.George NewsWestfall did not agree with Flint\u2019s assessment.Being bullied to the point where you hit the bully is snapping, he said.In contrast, Farnsworth\u2019s action were planned out.\"This took some planning.This took some thought, and that\u2019s troubling to me, because you didn\u2019t just \u2018snap.\u2019\"Westfall also addressed Farnsworth prior to sentencing, mentioning that one of the teen\u2019s siblings had written a letter to the court saying the event didn\u2019t define who their brother was.\"Unfortunately, there are things we do that define us,\" Westfall said.\"Had this incendiary device gone off and someone had been hurt, not only would you be defined by this behavior, but so would your family.\"In addition to the 48 months of probation and 250 hours community service, Westfall ordered Farnsworth to wear an ankle monitor for 90 days, have no access to bomb-making materials, seek a psychiatric evaluation for the purpose of getting needed medications, have no internet access for six months, observe a curfew and write an apology letter to Pine View High and its students.Following the sentencing, Deputy Washington County Attorney Angela Adams, who prosecuted the case, said the state was satisfied with the outcome.5th District Judge Michael Westfall listens to the defense for Martin Farnsworth prior to handing down a sentence of 48 months\u2019 probation, St.George, Utah, April 24, 2019 | Photo by Court Pool, St.George News\"He\u2019s getting 48 months of intensely supervised probation,\" Adams said, adding that if Farnsworth does something to put his probation in jeopardy, he could still end up facing the five years-to-life sentence suspended by the judge.\"Of course, we hope he will be successful on probation,\" she said.Adams also said she believes justice was served to the extent that the community is being protected and all involved are doing what they can to minimize the possibility of this incident repeating itself.\"The state is satisfied that the safeguards put into place will protect the community.\"The defense was also pleased with the results of the sentencing.\"What we were hoping for was (Farnsworth) being released from custody into probation without any further juvenile or adult incarceration and that\u2019s what we got,\" Flint said.Farnsworth served 415 days in juvenile detention prior to being released Wednesday.As for the additional restrictions, Flint said they were to be expected and not out of the ordinary for a case involving a first-degree felony.When asked about his client\u2019s reaction, Flint said he didn\u2019t have much of one.\"Martin doesn\u2019t react much,\" he said.\"That\u2019s the nature of autism spectrum disorder.He\u2019s very quiet and introverted.\"Farnsworth\u2019s autism was an angle largely ignored by the state, Flint said, which led to him being treated as a common criminal rather than as someone who needed additional consideration.\"Individuals with autism have a difficult time understanding how other people feel, and have a difficult time processing their own feelings when they are bullied or made fun of or even when they interact normally with other people, they\u2019re going to react differently, and it\u2019s like none of that mattered,\" he said.\"He committed a crime, no doubt about that, but it seems like nobody\u2019s noticing that he\u2019s autistic and he needs help.\"Copyright St.George News, SaintGeorgeUtah.com LLC,

{"text": "The Cafeter\u00eda Rolando bombing was an attack on 13 September 1974 at the Rolando cafe in Calle del Correo, Madrid, Spain which killed 13 people and wounded 71. Though no claim of responsibility was made, the attack is widely believed to have been carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA.==Background==The Rolando Cafe was located on 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid, close to the General Directorate of Security, the headquarters of the Spanish Police. It was regularly frequented by members of the police force and security services.==The attack==The bomb was placed at the entrance to the building and exploded on a Friday afternoon, during a busy lunchtime period. More than 300 people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the explosion, two of whom were among the dead. The explosion caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security, while two cars parked nearby were totally destroyed. The bomb caused part of the Rolando Cafe's ceiling to collapse and guests staying in a pension above were injured due to falling through the gaps in the ceiling. The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene.Two of the 12 initially killed and 11 of the injured were members of the police force. However the wounded included the number two of the Spanish Political Police, with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe. A thirteenth victim died in 1977 of injuries suffered during the attack.==Responses and arrests==The leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September, issued a statement denying their responsibility, though implicitly defending the bombing, claiming that the cafe was full of police agents. This caused tensions within the group, with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out, even if the results were not those intended. The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country, such as Blas Pi\u00f1ar, the opportunity to attack the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro.In the immediate period of confusion following the attack, some blamed the attack on the far-right. The police, however, concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group's infrastructure in Madrid. Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) of cooperating in the attack, but the PCE energetically denied involvement. Reports that police officers had received a circular advising them not to go to the Rolando Cafe or stand outside the building added to the mystery surrounding the incident.Leftists known to be sympathetic to ETA were arrested, including Eva Forest, wife of the communist playwright Alfonso Sastre, Mari Luz Fernandez and her relatives, Lidia Falc\u00f3n, the theatre director Vicente Sainz de la Pe\u00f1a, construction worker Antonio Dur\u00e1n, pilot Bernardo Badell and his wife Mar\u00eda del Carmen Nadal, the actress Mar\u00eda Paz Ballesteros, and the writer Eliseo Bayo. Between June 1975 and February 1976, courts dismissed the cases and released the defendants. However Eva Forest and Mari Luz Fernandez remained in prison as they were charged with complicity in the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco one year before. However, neither Forest nor Luz Fernandez were tried for the Rolando bombing, as they were released in June 1977 as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners. In 1981 Lidia Falc\u00f3n published a denunciation of Eva Forest which suggested that Forest's role in the Rolando attack had been considerable.The government also offered a reward of one million pesetas for information leading to the capture of Juan Manuel Galarraga Mendizabal who they suspected of being a high ranking ETA figure involved in the bombing. Exact authorship of the bombing has however remained a mystery.==References==", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place Cafeter\u00eda Rolando <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Rolando cafe <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim 71 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> Target building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place El Tobogan restaurant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim whom <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle damage <extra_id_0> Artifact buildings <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle shattering <extra_id_0> Artifact windows <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle destroyed <extra_id_0> Artifact cars <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle collapse <extra_id_0> Artifact ceiling <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim guests <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim 12 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 11 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim customers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim victim <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker organisation <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Eliseo Bayo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target Carlos Arias Navarro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassination <extra_id_0> Target Luis Carrero Blanco <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ReleaseParole released <extra_id_0> Defendant they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack carried out <extra_id_0> Attacker ETA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble placed <extra_id_0> Artifact bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact issued <extra_id_0> Topic statement <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator leadership <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "British Security Services Questioned About Surveillance PrioritiesLONDON \u2014\u00a0For the second time in a month Britain\u2019s security services are facing awkward questions about their surveillance policies, after it emerged the ringleader of Saturday\u2019s terror attack in the heart of London was known to them and had been interrogated in the past.The British-Pakistani, who police are not naming for operational reasons, was also a recognized Islamic State follower in the streets around his home in the east London district of Barking, where he tried to recruit children and proselytized openly in a nearby park, sparking a complaint to the police by a local resident.The 27-year-old, father of at least two young children, appeared also in a television documentary last year in which he was pictured unfurling an Islamic State banner and later arguing with police during a London protest organized by radical preacher Anjem Choudary, a convicted IS recruiter.Last month, community and mosque leaders in Manchester and neighbors of Salman Abedi, the British-Libyan who carried out the May 22 concert bombing in the city, accused the security services of missing several opportunities to identify him as a high-risk militant.FILE - A police officer stands outside Didsbury mosque in Manchester, Britain, May 24, 2017.At least five times locals warned the police of their fears about the 22-year-old suicide bomber. One community worker said he contacted authorities after Abedi said being a suicide bomber was OK.Insufficient responseNeither Britain\u2019s domestic intelligence service MI5 nor the Manchester police responded to the claims, but lawmakers have demanded to know why Abedi was seen just as a peripheral figure and one not requiring surveillance and investigation.FILE - Salman Abedi, the bomber behind the Manchester suicide bombing, is seen in this image taken from CCTV on the night he committed the attack in this handout photo released, May 27, 2017, from the Greater Manchester Police.Similar questions are being prompted again in the wake of the van-and-knife attack in the London Bridge district of Britain\u2019s capital. Erica Gasparri, a mother of three who lived in Barking told local media she had reported Abedi two years ago, after he approached kids in a local park. She says she confronted him after her two children came home and said, \u201cMummy I want to become a Muslim.\u201dThe parents of the ringleader of Saturday\u2019s attack are reported to have been asylum seekers from Pakistan. According to local media, the man, nicknamed Abz, worked at various times for a fast-food outlet, a clothing store and subsequently for the London Underground system.FILE - Police attend to an incident on London Bridge in London, Britain, June 3, 2017.A onetime friend of the ringleader also told the BBC that he warned police, alerting them to comments made about previous terrorist attacks in Britain and of his alarm at the man's increasingly extremist beliefs. The friend said the alleged attacker was a keen follower of American radical preacher Ahmad Musa Jibril and would watch YouTube videos of the cleric.\u201cHe used to listen to a lot of Musa Jibril,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cI phoned the anti-terror hotline. I spoke to the gentleman. I told him about our conversation and why I think he was radicalized ... I did my bit, I know a lot of other people did their bit, but the authorities did not do their bit,\u201d he added.Security strategy reviewA senior Conservative official told VOA that there is deep frustration in Downing Street about Saturday\u2019s attack and the fact that at least one of the assailants was known to the authorities.Prime Minister Theresa May promised to review Britain\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy, holding out the prospects of enhanced powers for the security services and longer jail sentences for extremists. She said she wants to take a tougher line with internet providers and social media businesses that allow extremist material on their sites.WATCH: British Prime Minister Theresa MayVideo sizewidthxheightpixelsBritain PM May: 'Enough is Enough'Share this video0:00:30\u25b60:00:00/0:00:30\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 1.5MB360p | 1.8MB480p | 10.5MBAmong the measures being recommended by security chiefs, according to government officials, is the power to require those on terror watch lists to wear electronic tags, a ban on the sale of unregistered SIM cards, and a ban on immediate vehicle rentals, requiring renters to wait two hours and for rental firms to run checks on them with the police.Police and counter-terror officers launched further raids early Monday in east London. A police spokesman said \u201ca number\u201d of people had been detained. Local residents reported hearing bangs and gunshots during the raids. On Sunday, police arrested 12 people, seven women and five men in connection with Saturday\u2019s terror attack.
