{"text": "What does the statement say?It apologises to the non-combatants, as it puts it. Using quite militaristic terms it refers to combatants, in other words members of the security forces, and non-combatants, in other words civilians.It says that on Bloody Friday, July 21 1972, and on other occasions the IRA's actions resulted in the deaths of non-combatants and the IRA offers its sincere apologies and condolences to their families.How significant is the statement?It is the first time the IRA has apologised in such strong terms.On previous occasions the IRA has said it regrets deaths but never before has it said \"sincere apologies and condolences\".What happened on Bloody Friday? This Sunday will be the 30th anniversary of Bloody Friday - when the IRA planted more than 20 bombs around Belfast.Twenty of them exploded, killing nine people and injuring more than 100 others.The people who died were both Catholics and Protestants - four bus drivers and two soldiers at a bus depot, two women and a 14-year-old boy at a row of shops.The victims came from all sections of the community.Why have the IRA released the statement now?The anniversary is one reason but the IRA is also trying to create a climate in which progress can be made.The statement also says the IRA remains totally committed to the peace process.We can also look back to 4 July when Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern met the pro-Good Friday Agreement parties at Hillsborough Castle.We heard a lot of talk that if paramilitaries on both sides did not show more commitment to the peace process the devolved government at Stormont could run into trouble.Finally, earlier this year, Republicans at an event in Dublin commemorated their dead and that was criticised in many quarters as glorifying what the IRA had done.I think all these reasons create the context in which the statement has been issued.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Contact apologises <extra_id_0> Participant non-combatants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact says <extra_id_0> Participant It <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths <extra_id_0> Victim non-combatants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact offers <extra_id_0> Participant families <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic condolences <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact apologised <extra_id_0> Participant IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack planted <extra_id_0> Attacker IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Belfast <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice Twenty <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact statement <extra_id_0> Topic IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact released <extra_id_0> Participant IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact met <extra_id_0> Participant parties <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Hillsborough Castle <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Boston Bombing Suspect Found GuiltyBOSTON \u2014\u00a0Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted on all counts Wednesday in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings by a federal jury that now must decide whether the 21-year-old former college student should be executed.Jurors spent slightly more than 11 hours deciding Tsarnaev's guilt in two days of deliberations after 16 days of testimony.\"It's not something that will ever be over,\" said Karen Brassard, whose ankles and shin were injured by pieces of the bomb. \"You'll feel it forever. It's forever a part of our life. ... I don't know what justice is. I'm grateful to have him off the street.''Two shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the marathon finish line on April 15, 2013, killing three people \u2013 Martin Richard, 8, Chinese student Lingzi Lu, 23, and Krystle Campbell, 29 \u2013 and wounding more than 260 others.Tsarnaev also was convicted in the death of Sean Collier, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology patrol officer shot to death three days later, as Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, attempted to evade police.The defendant, dressed in a blue sweater and dark blazer, looked pale as he entered the courtroom to hear the verdict. His lawyer, Judy Clarke, gave him a brief pat on the back as he sat down.VOA's Fatima Tlisova reported Tsarnaev folded his arms, fidgeted and looked down at the defense table as he listened to one guilty verdict after another on all 30 counts against him, including conspiracy, murder and use of a weapon of mass destruction.There were some families of victims in the courtroom, and their reaction as the verdict was read was very calm, Tlisova observed. She noted, though, they seemed satisfied with the verdict, judging by discussions she had with them outside the courthouse.Seventeen of the counts are capital offenses, making Tsarnaev eligible for the death penalty.\u201cI hope today\u2019s verdict provides a small amount of closure for the survivors, families, and all impacted by the violent and tragic events surrounding the 2013 Boston Marathon,\u201d Boston Mayor Martin Walsh said in a statement. \u201cThe incidents of those days have forever left a mark on our city.\u201dJudy Clarke, left, and David Bruck, defense attorneys for convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, will try to prevent his getting a death sentence. They're shown at the federal courthouse in Boston, Massachusetts, April 6, 2015.Penalty phaseDuring the penalty phase, which could begin as early as Monday, Tsarnaev's lawyers will present so-called mitigating evidence they hope will save his life.That could include evidence about his family, his relationship with his brother, and his childhood in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and later in the volatile Dagestan region of Russia.Tsarnaev's conviction was practically a foregone conclusion: His lawyers admitted he participated in the bombings.But in a bid to save Tsarnaev from a death sentence, defense attorney Clarke argued that Tsarnaev, then 19, fell under the influence of his radicalized older brother. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died when he was shot by police and run over by his brother during a chaotic getaway attempt days after the bombing.\"If not for Tamerlan, it [the bombing] would not have happened,\" Clarke told the jury during closing arguments.Prosecutors laid out evidence that the defendant, an ethnic Chechen who emigrated from Russia a decade before the attack, had read and listened to jihadist materials, and wrote a note in the boat where he was found hiding suggesting the bombing was an act of retribution for U.S. military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries.Jurors' questionsEarlier Wednesday, the jury asked U.S. District Judge George O'Toole to clarify two legal terms.South Boston resident Joe Kebartas, holding a sign reading \"Death Penalty is Murder,\" demonstrates outside the federal courthouse where Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been convicted on all 30 counts, April 8, 2015.They asked about the term \"conspiracy,\" which appears in several of the charges. O'Toole explained it applied to a plot between Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev that existed from February through April 19 of 2013, when the younger brother was caught.Jurors also asked if \"aiding and abetting,\" which also appears in several charges, were separate ideas. The judge said the terms represent a single concept.Massachusetts has not executed anyone since 1947, and Roman Catholic bishops in the state reiterated their opposition to the death penalty on Monday, when the first phase of the trial wrapped up.VOA's Fatima Tlisova contributed to this report from Boston, and some material for this report came from Reuters, AFP and AP.Watch video report from VOA's Zlatica Hoke:Video sizewidthxheightpixelsBoston Jury to Mull Life or Death for TsarnaevShare this video0:03:18\u25b60:00:00/0:03:18\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 6.0MB360p | 8.5MB486p | 70.7MB/*<![CDATA[*/initInfographics({groups:[],params:[{\"Name\":\"embed_code\",\"Value\":\"\\u0026lt;div class=\\\"storify\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;iframe src=\\\"//storify.com/voa_news/boston-bomber-convicted-on-all-counts/embed?border=false\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"750\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" allowtransparency=\\\"true\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/iframe\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;script src=\\\"//storify.com/voa_news/boston-bomber-convicted-on-all-counts.js?border=false\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;noscript\\u0026gt;[\\u0026lt;a href=\\\"//storify.com/voa_news/boston-bomber-convicted-on-all-counts\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u0026gt;View the story \\\"Boston Bomber Convicted on All Counts\\\" on Storify\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;]\\u0026lt;/noscript\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;\",\"DefaultValue\":\"\",\"HtmlEncode\":false,\"Type\":\"String\"}],isMobile:true});Error rendering storify.(function(d){var userInput = Infographics.Param[\"embed_code\"],notRenderedS = d.querySelectorAll(\".storifySnippet:not(.storifySnippetRendered)\"),render = function() {try {var oEval = d.createElement(\"div\");oEval.innerHTML = userInput;} catch(e) {var snippets = d.getElementsByClassName(\"storifySnippet\");var lastSnippet = snippets[snippets.length -

{"text": "Latest news straight to your inbox Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Invalid EmailThe second Birmingham pub bombings pre-inquest review takes place this week. Andy Richards reveals for the first time the tragic story of young victim Marilyn Paula Nash.An early riser for work, council worker John Smith needed to be on autopilot as he set off as usual on the grey, dismal Friday morning that is forever etched in his memory.Normally, he would have had a spring in his step. After all, all the weekend was beckoning. It was a chance for him to unwind from the office graft, and perhaps enjoy a drink or two.But this wasn\u2019t a normal morning. In fact, there had never been another morning quite like it in the West Midlands.The previous night, well, at that stage all the terrible details were not known. Accounts varied, the death toll was rising.Bombers \u2013 everyone knew they were the IRA, although the terror group had not claimed responsibility \u2013 had destroyed two pubs in Birmingham city centre.Nineteen people were dead, several were clinging to life, two of whom would eventually succumb to dreadful injuries.The number of injured seemed to change with almost every news bulletin, but it was steadily increasing, and by now it was more than 150.On the previous night \u2013 November 21, 1974 \u2013 families across the UK had clustered around TV sets and radios, utterly aghast and trying to take in what the news flashes from Birmingham were showing and describing.In the city, and across the Black Country towns of West Bromwich, Dudley, Walsall and Wolverhampton, fear of more attacks, combined with growing anger, was visceral.There had already been a number of reprisal attacks on Irish homes and businesses. The region bristled with tension.John\u2019s head was already full of this as he fastened his coat to leave his Walsall home. Little did he know that the sickening horror of the previous night was on his own doorstep.He stepped out... and into a nightmare scenario.John, now a 74-year-old pensioner and still living in the same terraced property, knows the memories can never be erased.\u201cIt must have been about 7am,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had all heard about the bombs going off in the pubs in Birmingham the night before. The whole area was in shock, people could hardly believe it.\u201dIn his early 30s at the time, on that Friday morning he was intent on catching his usual bus for the daily journey to work at Lichfield Council where he was involved in planning sewerage pipe developments.As he set off from the small close in Pelsall where his family lived, he was confronted by the extraordinary sight of his neighbour, Mr Nash stumbling about in the road \u201clike a lost man\u201d.John remembers his neighbour\u2019s tears and his face \u2013 the face of a man in absolute torment.\u201cHe was simply wandering about, not going anywhere but obviously really upset,\u201d recalls John. \u201cSo naturally I went to him and asked him what was wrong.\u201cHe said his daughter, Marilyn, had been in Birmingham the night before. She still hadn\u2019t come home.\u201dMr Nash was a widower and lived with Marilyn, who was 22, and his son, Robert, in the terraced house next door. John thinks Robert was away studying at university at the time. Either way, there was no-one else at home.With nobody to talk to, Mr Nash\u2019s agony had multiplied with each long hour throughout the blackest of nights.\u201cI tried to comfort him as best I could, but what can you do? What can you say?,\u201d says John. \u201cHis daughter should have been home hours ago. There had been no sign or word of her.\u201cI persuaded him to come back to our house where I left him with my mother before I went on to work. She did her best to help him.\u201dWhatever conversation passed between John\u2019s mother and Mr Nash is not known. Neither is how long the poor man waited for news.But his fears for his daughter were sadly well-founded. She never did come home.It took the authorities some time to confirm that Birmingham shop worker Marilyn Paula Nash \u2013 known as Paula to her family and close friends \u2013 was among the dead.She was an attractive, vivacious young woman, with a hint of Jackie Onassis about her looks and hairstyle.Those tasked with the dreadful job of identifying the dead could only confirm it was her by her wage packet, says John.\u201cI remember that she was a very sweet, very friendly girl,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe was my next door neighbour and a reasonably similar age so, although were were not close, we would always say hello, and pass the time of day. Sometimes we would catch the same bus if we were going into Birmingham for a drink, and we would chat.\u201dA fateful decision by Marilyn to pop into a pub for a quick drink on the way home from work cost her her life.It was the penultimate pay day before Christmas. The pubs in Birmingham were full and business was brisk. Marilyn headed for the Tavern In The Town, the underground bar in New Street which had become a cult drinking hole for students and young workers.So did the bombers. They wrought carnage there, and at the nearby Mulberry Bush at the bottom of The Rotunda.\u201cWhen it became known that Marilyn was among the dead, this whole area was in absolute shock,\u201d remembers John. \u201cThere was a big Irish community locally and a local Catholic club was nearby.\u201cI remember the police ordering the Catholic club to be closed for security reasons for a time. I don\u2019t think that was necessary, but I suppose they feared reprisals or trouble and had to be careful.\u201dMr Nash, who later remarried, is understood to have passed away many years ago, and Marilyn\u2019s brother is believed to live in another part of the country.John is probably the only resident from those days still living in the small, tidy street that witnessed such awful events.The homes there are well-kept but nowadays many have signs in their windows making it clear that callers without appointments are not welcome.It suggests the residents prefer keep themselves to themselves.Most probably have no idea of the tragedy that visited the Nash family 42 years ago.(Image: Wesley/Keystone/Getty Images)As for John, his chat with me has clearly stirred recollections that have lay dormant for many years.But he is not optimistic that the new inquest will bring truth or closure to those who still grieve.\u201cLike a good many others I would like to know what really went on that night but...\u201d and here he pauses.\u201cIt may turn something up, but those who did it have got away with it for too long.\u201dEx-IRA chief: Pub attacks left me ashamed and appalled...(Image: Birmingham Mail)The IRA\u2019s involvement in the bombings became clearer with the publication of the memoirs of Kieran Conway, head of the its intelligence-gathering department during the 1970s.In his book Southside Provisional, he confessed that the attacks on the pubs left him \u201cashamed and appalled.\u201dThe attacks on the Birmingham pubs, neither of which had any military connection, \u201cwent against everything we claimed to stand for,\u201d he said.The bombings came after police disrupted the funeral arrangements for James McDade, a lieutenant in the Birmingham Brigade of the IRA who blew himself up while trying to attack Coventry Telephone Exchange a few days earlier.\u201cTempers were high and I, for one, certainly at first feared that the local IRA had knowingly caused these dreadful casualties,\u201d said Conway.He claimed the IRA unit responsible \u201ccould not find a functioning telephone box, so they were unable to issue a warning sufficiently in time to clear the bars and prevent the mass loss of life.\u201dConway finally left the Republican movement in 1993 and is now a criminal lawyer in Dublin.Fighting families\u2019 legal aid problems still to be resolvedRelatives of more than half the victims are hoping to be represented by lawyers at the pre-inquest review hearing on Thursday.But at the time of going to press, longstanding issues of legal aid had still to be resolved.For several months the Government had insisted that KRW Law, the Belfast-based law firm representing most of the families, was not eligible for legal aid.But at the end of last month, there was a U-turn and the Legal Aid Agency is currently considering a fresh application.Legal Aid Minister Sir Oliver Heald QC said: \u201cIt would be a travesty for families to be denied justice simply because of a technicality, which is why I have taken the decision to change the regulations around inquest funding. This will remove any barrier from the families\u2019 solicitors in applying for legal aid funding for the inquest.\u201dThe inquest was re-opened in June last year following a campaign by the families, backed by the Birmingham Mail. The full inquest is expected to take place in September.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Target pub <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack destroyed <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Bombers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure were <extra_id_0> Victim several <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die injuries <extra_id_0> Victim two <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Infect injured <extra_id_0> Victim 150 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target homes <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack going off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim Marilyn Paula Nash <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact says <extra_id_0> Participant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact asked <extra_id_0> Participant I <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact says <extra_id_0> Participant John <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact persuaded <extra_id_0> Participant him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact recalls <extra_id_0> Participant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact says <extra_id_0> Participant John <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact remembers <extra_id_0> Participant John <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact chat <extra_id_0> Participant me <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target Pub <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack came  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew <extra_id_0> Attacker James McDade <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Coventry Telephone Exchange <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Conway <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> StartPosition is <extra_id_0> Employee Conway <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PlaceOfEmployment Dublin <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Oliver Heald QC <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Jury Selection Begins in Trial of Accused Boston Bomber's FriendBOSTON \u2014\u00a0Jury selection was set to begin on Monday in a U.S. court in Boston for the trial of the first of three friends of the Boston Marathon bombing suspect, charged with obstructing the investigation into the deadly blasts.Federal prosecutors contend that Kazakh exchange student Azamat Tazhayakov, along with two schoolmates, went to marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth three days after the April 15, 2013, attack and removed a laptop computer and backpack containing empty fireworks shells.One of Tazhayakov's lawyers, Matthew Myers, last week told reporters that his 20-year-old client had rejected a plea deal offered by prosecutors, contending that there was a \u201clack of evidence\u201d to convict the man.A key issue at the trial, set for opening statements next week, will be whether to admit statements that Tazhayakov and fellow Kazakh exchange student Dias Kadyrbayev made to investigators after they were ordered out of their New Bedford, Massachusetts, apartment by heavily armed federal agents and questioned for hours at a police station without having attorneys present.Kadyrbayev, 20, testified at a pretrial hearing early this month that he had not felt that he was free to go during the questioning. The two were arrested on April 20, 2013, on immigration violations.U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock has said he will declare a mistrial if he finds the statements were not voluntary.Three people were killed and 264 injured in the bombing at the historic Boston Marathon.Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov, both charged with obstruction of justice, could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted. A third friend, Robel Phillipos of Cambridge, Massachusetts, faces up to 16 years if convicted of the less serious charge of lying to investigators.Prosecutors have not charged any of the men with a role in the bombing itself. They contend that Tsarnaev, 20, and his brother, Tamerlan, 26, placed two homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the race's crowded finish line and three days later fatally shot a university police officer while attempting to flee the city.Tamerlan died after a gunbattle with police later that night. Dzhokhar is awaiting trial on charges that carry the threat of execution if he is convicted.

{"text": "Accused Boston Bomber Says Satisfied With Defense LawyersBOSTON \u2014\u00a0The Boston Marathon bombing suspect, in his first court appearance in more than a year, told a judge on Thursday that he was satisfied with his lawyers' preparations for the January start of his trial over the deadly 2013 attack.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, was dressed in a dark sweater and wore his hair shaggy for his appearance at U.S. District Court, where he will be tried on charges of killing three people and injuring more than 260 with two homemade bombs at the race's crowded finish line on April 15, 2013, as well as fatally shooting a university police officer three days later.The defendant, who had grown a light beard, appeared in a courtroom packed with victims, supporters and curious onlookers.Tsarnaev looked alert and healthy, showing no signs of the injuries suffered during a gunbattle with police on the night of April 18, 2013, that ended with the death of his brother, Tamerlan, also accused with playing a role in the attack. In his prior court appearance, in July 2013, Tsarnaev's left arm was in a cast and his face appeared swollen.U.S. District Judge George O'Toole asked Tsarnaev if he was satisfied with his defense attorneys in a series of questions intended to avoid any post-trial assertions that he was not provided a proper defense.\"Yes, your honor,\" Tsarnaev replied briefly to questions about whether his attorneys were keeping him abreast of court developments. He looked somewhat fidgety during the 25-minute hearing.O'Toole also said that many of the court documents filed under seal ahead of the trial will be made public after the jury is seated in January.'Stay strong'Tsarnaev faces the possibility of execution if convicted in a trial that is expected to run for three months. The court plans to weed through more than 1,000 people to find 12 jurors and six alternates to hear the case.At the hearing's conclusion, Elena Teyer, 45, whose son-in-law Ibragim Todashev was fatally shot by FBI agents in Florida during an interview about his friendship with Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the weeks after the bombing, shouted support to Tsarnaev in Russian.Outside court, she translated her words for reporters as \"Dzhokhar, we know you're innocent ... stay strong, son.\"A resident of Savannah, Georgia, Teyer said she had traveled to Boston specifically for the hearing.\"You know how hard it is when you have no one near you who is going to support you,\" Teyer said.Thursday's hearing is the final pre-trial conference in Tsarnaev's case. In the weeks leading up to the trial, prosecutors and defense attorneys are disputing a range of issues including how much they must disclose about the witnesses they plan to call.The Tsarnaev brothers had moved to the United States from Russia's restive Chechnya region a decade before the attack.Dzhokhar left a scrawled note inside the dry-docked boat where he was captured in Watertown, Massachusetts, a day after the shootout, indicating that the marathon attack had been motivated by U.S. military campaigns in Muslim countries.Tsarnaev's attorneys had asked that the trial be held outside Boston, contending that since hundreds of thousands of spectators attend the Boston Marathon, it would be all but impossible to find an impartial panel of people who had not been present the day of the attack or known someone who had been.O'Toole had previously denied that request, noting the court had recently seated juries in other high-profile cases, including the 2013 trial of former mob boss James \"Whitey\" Bulger, who was found guilty of racketeering and murder.On his way into court, one of the bombing's victims, Marc Fucarile, confronted a small group of protesters who asserted the evidence of the bombing was fabricated. Fucarile grabbed the prosthetic limb that replaced the right leg he lost in the bombing, saying he considered that proof enough.Asked about the incident, Fucarile said, \"They have a right to their opinion, same as anybody else.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing trial <extra_id_0> Defendant his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing tried <extra_id_0> Defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim 260 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die fatally <extra_id_0> Victim officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shooting <extra_id_0> Target officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die death <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing hearing <extra_id_0> Defendant He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shot <extra_id_0> Place Florida <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker agents <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Ibragim Todashev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die fatally <extra_id_0> Victim Ibragim Todashev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer agents <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Florida <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing hearing <extra_id_0> Defendant Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation moved <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination United States <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin Chechnya <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker Dzhokhar <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shootout <extra_id_0> Attacker Dzhokhar <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing trial <extra_id_0> Defendant James \"Whitey\" Bulger <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict found guilty <extra_id_0> Defendant James \"Whitey\" Bulger <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target Marc Fucarile <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Bogot\u00e1 car bomb: Colombia blames ELN rebels for deadly explosion Published duration 18 January 2019image copyright Reuters image caption The explosion outside a police academy shocked the Colombian capitalColombia has blamed the left-wing National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group for a car bomb attack that killed 21 people in the capital, Bogot\u00e1.Dozens more were injured in Thursday's blast after an explosives-laden vehicle broke into the grounds of a police academy before it detonated.The driver, who was also killed, has been identified as a 57-year-old man.President Ivan Duque put peace talks with the ELN on hold when he took power in 2018.Any restart to the negotiations is unlikely following the attack, the deadliest in the country in many years, correspondents say.What has the government said?The driver, named earlier as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, was a long-time ELN member and the group's top explosives expert, Defence Minister Guillermo Botero said.The suspect, known by his war alias \"El Mocho\" or \"Kiko\", had lost his right hand in an accident with an explosive and was based in the northern department of Arauca, from where he frequently crossed into Venezuela.\"This was an operation that has been planned for the past 10 months,\" Mr Botero said, adding that the guerrillas were the \"intellectual authors\" behind the driver's attack.A second man who had \"participated\" in the carrying out of the attack was arrested in Bogot\u00e1, Attorney General N\u00e9stor Humberto Mart\u00ednez said.image copyright EPA image caption A vigil was held in Bogot\u00e1 on Thursday to honour the victimsPresident Duque, who visited the site of the explosion on Thursday, described the attack as a \"crazy terrorist act\".\"We won't rest until we capture and bring to justice the terrorists involved,\" he said. \"Colombians have never yielded to terrorism, we have always defeated it. This will not be an exception.\"Colombia's High Commissioner for Peace Miguel Ceballos said there would be \"no space for dialogue with the ELN until they hand over all the kidnapped people and completely renounce their criminal acts.\"What do we know about the explosion?The grey Nissan Patrol entered the compound of the General Santander police academy in the south of Bogot\u00e1 where a promotion ceremony for cadets was being held.When the car was stopped by guards at a checkpoint, the driver accelerated and hit a wall, at which point the vehicle exploded.The vehicle was carrying 80kg (176lb) of the powerful explosive pentolite, which has been used in the past by Colombia's rebel guerrilla groups.The blast at 09:30 local time (14:30 GMT) shattered windows of nearby buildings.image copyright EPA image caption The explosion happened outside a school for police cadetsTwenty of the victims were police cadets aged between 17 and 22, Mr Botero said.At least 68 people were injured but the majority of those have since been discharged from hospital.Who are the ELN rebels?image copyright Getty Images image caption The group has been fighting the Colombian state for more than five decadesThe 2,000-strong guerrilla group was founded in 1964 to fight against Colombia's unequal distribution of land and riches, inspired by the Cuban revolution of 1959Over the decades, the group has attacked large landholders and multinational companies, and repeatedly blown up oil pipelinesTo finance itself it has resorted to extortion, kidnappings and drug traffickingIt has been strongest in rural areasWhat's the current situation in Colombia?Car bombs were not uncommon during the decades-long conflict between the Colombian government and left-wing rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc).But an explosion of a car bomb of this size is something that has not happened in a long time in Bogot\u00e1 and it took the city by surprise, BBC Mundo Colombia correspondent Boris Miranda reports.Colombia has significantly reduced bomb attacks and murders in recent years but the attack shows that it is a continuing fear for citizens, our correspondent adds.The Farc signed a peace agreement with the government in November 2016 and the group has since become a political party of the same name.The party's leader, Pastor Alape, condemned the attack. , calling it a \"provocation against the political way out of the conflict\".Peace talks between the smaller ELN and the previous government of President Juan Manuel Santos stalled, and President Duque, who takes a more hardline approach to the group, has not resumed them.Related Topics BogotaColombia", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Attacker rebels <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice car bomb: <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Target academy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place capital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice car bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker National Liberation Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place capital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer National Liberation Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim more <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injurer National Liberation Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target academy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle broke <extra_id_0> Instrument vehicle <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim driver <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer driver <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Place Bogot\u00e1 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict kidnapped  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation entered <extra_id_0> Vehicle Nissan Patrol <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination compound <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice pentolite <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle shattered <extra_id_0> Artifact windows <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle blown up <extra_id_0> Artifact pipelines <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice car bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Bogot\u00e1 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacked <extra_id_0> Attacker group <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target landholders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "On 4 December 1971, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group, detonated a bomb at McGurk's Bar in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The pub was frequented by Irish Catholics/nationalists. The explosion caused the building to collapse, killing fifteen Catholic civilians\u2014including two children\u2014and wounding seventeen more. It was the deadliest attack in Belfast during the Troubles.Despite evidence to the contrary, the British security forces asserted that a bomb had exploded prematurely while being handled by Irish Republican Army (IRA) members inside the pub, implying that the victims themselves were partly to blame. A report later found that the police (Royal Ulster Constabulary) were biased in favour of this view, and that this hindered their investigation. The victims' relatives allege that the security forces deliberately spread disinformation to discredit the IRA. In 1977, UVF member Robert Campbell was sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in the bombing and served fifteen years.The bombing sparked a series of tit-for-tat bombings and shootings by loyalists and republicans, which contributed to making 1972 the bloodiest year of the conflict.==Background==McGurk's (also called the Tramore Bar) was a two-storey public house on the corner of North Queen Street and Great George's Street, in the New Lodge area to the north of Belfast city centre. This was a mainly Irish nationalist and Catholic neighbourhood, and the pub's regular customers were from the community. The pub was owned by Patrick and Philomena McGurk, who lived on the upper floor with their four children.The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) was formed in Belfast in 1966, declaring \"war\" on the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Until 1971, however, its actions were few and it \"scarcely existed in an organisational sense\". The British Army was deployed in Northern Ireland following the August 1969 riots, which are usually seen as the start of the Troubles. In December 1969 the IRA split into two factions: the 'Official' IRA and Provisional IRA. Both launched armed campaigns against the British Army, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the government of Northern Ireland.During 1971, the violence gradually worsened. There were daily bombings and shootings by republicans, loyalists and the security forces. During the first two weeks of December, there were about 70 bombings and about 30 people were killed. On 2 December, three republican prisoners escaped from Crumlin Road prison, not far from McGurk's. Security was tightened and there was a heavy RUC and British Army presence in the area over the next two days. Eyewitnesses asserted that the checkpoints around McGurk's were removed just an hour before the attack.==Bombing==On the evening of Saturday 4 December 1971, a four-man UVF team met in the Shankill area of Belfast and were ordered to bomb a pub on North Queen Street. According to the only convicted bomber\u2014Robert Campbell\u2014they were told not to return until the job was done. Campbell said that their target had not been McGurk's, but another pub nearby. It is believed this was a pub called The Gem, which was allegedly linked to the Official IRA. The  bomb was disguised as a brown parcel, which they placed in a car and drove to their target. Campbell says they stopped near The Gem at about 7:30pm, but could not gain access to it because there were security guards outside. After waiting for almost an hour, they drove a short distance to McGurk's. At about 8:45pm, one of them placed the bomb in the porch entrance on Great George's Street and rushed back to the car. It exploded just moments after they drove off. Campbell implied that McGurk's had been chosen only because it was \"the nearest Catholic pub\".The blast caused the building to collapse. Bystanders immediately rushed to free the dead and wounded from the rubble. Firefighters, paramedics, police and soldiers were quickly on the scene. Fifteen Catholic civilians had been killed\u2014including two children\u2014and a further seventeen wounded. The rescue effort lasted many hours.Within two hours of the blast, a sectarian clash had erupted nearby at the New Lodge\u2013Tiger's Bay interface. The British Army and RUC moved in and a gun battle developed. A British Army officer, Major Jeremy Snow, was shot by the IRA on New Lodge Road and died of his wounds on 8 December. Two RUC officers and five civilians were also wounded by gunfire. Eventually, five companies of troops were sent into the district and they searched almost 50 houses.Meanwhile, the UVF team had driven to a nearby pickup point where they dumped their car. They walked to the area of St Anne's Cathedral and were picked up by another. They were driven back to the Shankill and met the man who had ordered the attack in an Orange Hall, telling him that \"the job has been done\".Among those killed were Philomena and Maria McGurk, wife and 14-year-old daughter of the pub owner Patrick McGurk. Patrick and his three sons were seriously injured. Shortly after the attack, McGurk appeared on television calling for no retaliation: \"It doesn't matter who planted the bomb. What's done can't be undone. I've been trying to keep bitterness out of it.\"==Investigation=====Responsibility===After the bombing, the media reported various theories about who was responsible. The main theories were:*that it had been planted by loyalists;*that it had exploded prematurely while being prepared by IRA members inside the pub;*that it had exploded prematurely while \"in transit\", an IRA member having left it in the pub to be collected by another IRA member; and*that it had been planted as part of a feud between the Provisional IRA and Official IRA.The security forces promoted the idea that it was an IRA bomb which exploded prematurely (an \"own goal\"). Survivors and relatives denied this. They said the pub was not associated with the IRA and there had been no suspicious people or activity in the pub that night. An Intelligence Corps document from December 1971 also said that the pub was not known to have IRA associations. On 6 December, both wings of the IRA condemned the attack, denied responsibility and blamed the UVF and security forces.====Claims of responsibility====That same day, several newspapers received telephone calls from someone claiming to be a spokesman for the \"Empire Loyalists\". Their statement to the Belfast Telegraph was:We [the Empire Loyalists] accept responsibility for the destruction of McGurk's pub. We placed 30lb of new explosives outside the pub because we had proved beyond doubt that meetings of IRA Provisionals and Officials were held there. The \"Empire Loyalists\" had made only one other claim of responsibility; for bombing a community centre on 12 November. The RUC, however, had no intelligence about such a group; suggesting that it may have been a covername.On Tuesday 7 December, a youth claimed to have seen a man acting oddly at a phone kiosk the night before. He said the man was wearing a jacket with a UVF badge on it. The youth claimed to have checked the kiosk after the man left and found a torn bit of paper. When put together, it included the lines:We the Empire Loyalists wish to state that we did not destroy McGurk's public house as an act of retaliation ... Furthermore we do not require the forensic experts of the Army to cover up for us ... We shall not issue any further statements until we exterminate another rebel stronghold.In the days following the bombing, the RUC received a letter signed by \"Chief of Staff, UVF\" claiming that the UVF bombed the pub because an IRA meeting was due to take place there. It said that two UVF members entered the pub, had a drink and asked the barman to mind a package while they \"ran an errand\". Witnesses told the RUC, however, that there had been no strangers in the pub and that nobody had left a package. Three other unsigned letters were sent to the RUC, claiming it was an IRA bomb \"in transit\" and that two IRA members were killed.====Location of the bomb====For the RUC, the location of the bomb (whether it exploded inside or outside) became the key to finding who was responsible. However, investigators (both RUC and British Army) were unsure and gave conflicting opinions.RUC duty officers' reports were made daily. Their purpose was to brief the Chief Constable and others at HQ about events that had happened that day. The reports were also made available to the British Army's General Officer Commanding for Northern Ireland. The 4\u20135 December 1971 report said of the bombing: \"Just before the explosion a man entered the licensed premises and left down a suitcase, presumably to be picked up by a known member of the IRA. The bomb was intended for use on other premises. Before the 'pick-up' was made the bomb exploded\". The origin of this information could not be established.On 6 December, however, the RUC took a witness statement from an 8-year-old boy. He said that a car had stopped outside the pub with four men inside and \"a wee Union Jack stuck in the back window\". He said one left a package in the Great George's Street doorway and ran back to the car, which sped off just moments before the package exploded. A man and a woman backed up his story, although they did not witness as much as the boy. Despite this, the security forces and the government stood behind the \"own goal\" theory. A British Intelligence Corps document covering the period 8\u201315 December said: \"It has been confirmed that it was a [Provisional IRA] bomb which was destined for another target, but exploded prematurely.\" A Ministry of Defence (MOD) document dated 14 December said that this \"should be publicised\". On 23 December, the British Army sent a letter (signed by a lieutenant colonel) to people living in north Belfast. It said that when the IRA in the area is destroyed, \"we can look forward to \u2026 a period in which you will not lose your friends in a repetition of the [IRA's] accident in the McGurk\u2019s bar.\"===Arrest and conviction of Robert Campbell===In March 1976, the RUC received intelligence that linked UVF member Robert Campbell and four others to the McGurk's bombing. Campbell was arrested on 27 July 1977 and held at Castlereagh RUC base. He was interviewed seven times during 27 and 28 July. He admitted his part in the bombing but refused to name the others. Campbell's story matches that given by the young boy witness.On 29 July 1977, Campbell was charged with the 15 murders and 17 attempted murders. On 6 September 1978 he pleaded guilty to all charges and received life imprisonment with \"a recommendation to serve no less than 20 years\", in part for a separate conviction for the murder of a Protestant delivery driver in 1976. He is the only person to have been charged for the bombing. He eventually served fifteen years in prison and was released on 9 September 1993.===Collusion claims and Police Ombudsman's investigation===The victims' relatives campaigned for an independent investigation of the bombing as they believed that the RUC's investigation was flawed from the outset. Moreover, they wished to disprove the claim that the victims were IRA members killed by their own bomb (the \"own goal\" theory). Even after Campbell's conviction, the \"own goal\" theory remained officially unchallenged. Relatives argued that this theory was promoted as part of a \"government policy to avoid publicly acknowledging the loyalist campaign of violence\". Another argument is that it was promoted to undermine the IRA's support and stir tension between the two IRA factions.Relatives also asked how the bombers were able to plant the bomb and flee despite the usually heavy security presence. Some alleged that the security forces helped the bombers by removing checkpoints. The 2009 book Killing For Britain, written by former UVF member 'John Black', claimed that the British undercover unit known as the Military Reaction Force or Military Reconnaissance Force (MRF) organized the bombing and helped the bombers get in and out of the area. The bombers' original target, The Gem, was associated with the Official IRA. It is claimed that the MRF ordered the team to bomb The Gem, with the intention of blaming it on the Provisional IRA. The plan was allegedly to start a feud between the two IRA factions, which would both divert them from their campaign against British forces and drain their support. However, as The Gem had security outside, they bombed the nearest 'Catholic pub'.On 21 February 2011, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland published a report about the bombing and the RUC's investigation of it. The report said that there is no evidence that the RUC helped the UVF bombers. However, it found that the RUC investigation was biased in favour of the view that the IRA was responsible. It failed to give enough thought to the possible involvement of loyalists, and this bias hindered the investigation. The report also found that RUC gave \"selective\" and \"misleading\" briefings to the government and media, which furthered the idea that it was an IRA bomb. The Ombudsman has not found an explanation why successive Chief Constables have not addressed this mistake. Ombudsman Al Hutchinson said: \"Inconsistent police briefings, some of which inferred that victims of the bombing were culpable in the atrocity, caused the bereaved families great distress, which has continued for many years\".On 6 December 2012, Scottish Labour MP Michael Connarty - whose uncle was killed in the bombing - claimed in Westminster that then-Prime Minister Edward Heath \"may have been involved\" in wrongfully blaming the IRA and spreading the story. Connarty also urged David Cameron, Prime Minister at the time, to apologise to victims and launch a full investigation.==Remembrance==In 2001 a memorial was unveiled on the site of McGurk's Bar to mark the 30th anniversary of the bombing. Relatives of the victims called for an investigation into allegations that British forces helped the bombers. Almost a thousand people attended a service at St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street, after which fifteen wreaths, one for each victim, were carried by relatives leading a silent candlelit procession to a new memorial at Great George's Street.Patrick McGurk died on 15 December 2007, having forgiven those responsible for the explosion and having prayed for the men who carried out the attack.==See

{"text": "Oklahoma City Bombing Documentary Examines Growth of American ExtremismWASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0The Oklahoma City bombing nearly 22 years ago was an act of domestic terror by U.S. military veteran Timothy McVeigh and his accomplice, Terry Nichols. The bombing destroyed one third of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, killing 168 people and injuring 680 others. In his documentary, Oklahoma City, filmmaker Barak Goodman revisits the bombing as the first major domestic terrorist attack in the United States on April 19, 1995.It was the number of civilians killed - especially the 15 children, four of them infants, crushed inside the building's day care center - that made this terrorist attack by a massive fertilizer bomb so heinous for many Americans. Many films have recounted the story, but Goodman\u2019s documentary treats the Oklahoma City bombing as a springboard to examine the roots of America's ultra-right militia and to analyze the makeup of homegrown American terrorism.History of suspicion\u201cIt goes all the way back to the founding of the Republic,\u201d the filmmaker told VOA. \"The Republic was founded on the suspicion of government.\" Goodman says many of these extreme separatists believe in white supremacy and in unregulated freedom to keep and bear arms so that they can protect themselves from outsiders and the government.In the documentary, former militia member Kerry Noble explains the ideology. \u201cThe government is an enemy of the people, and in this war it\u2019s an all or nothing. We\u2019re either gonna win as the white race or we\u2019re gonna lose.\u201d FILE - In this April 21, 1995 file photo, Timothy McVeigh is led out of the Noble County Courthouse by state and federal law enforcement officials in Perry, Oklahoma, after being identified as a suspect in the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal building. McVeigh was eventually convicted of the bombing and executed.Oklahoma City points to two events in the late 20th century that bolstered separatist ideologies: The Ruby Ridge incident on August 21, 1992, and the Waco siege in Waco, Texas, between February 28 and April 19, 1993. In both cases, federal and local government agents clashed with American separatists. The deadly incidents were fueled by the authorities' demand to search the premises for illegal firearms.The Waco siege was particularly deadly. The compound belonged to a group known as the Branch Davidians, led by David Koresh. When federal authorities sent in armed agents and armored vehicles to end the standoff, a fire engulfed the compound, killing 82 people, including David Koresh. Sixty-two of the victims were women and children.Birth of an extremistTimothy McVeigh, a Gulf War veteran disillusioned by the government during his tour in Iraq, was among those who went to witness the siege. According to the documentary, McVeigh was radicalized by those events and by an extremist publication called The Turner Diaries.\u201cIt\u2019s a Talisman for the far right, even to this day, but especially back in the '90s and '80s it was the \u2018Bible\u2019 of this movement,\u201d says Goodman. \u201cIt\u2019s a novel about a small group of \u2018patriots,\u2019 \u2018white patriots\u2019 who retake the government from the Jews and blacks who have infiltrated it, essentially. It\u2019s a racist creed and as I said, it is very poorly done. Intriguingly though, it describes the bombing of the FBI, the culmination of the novel, and it really lays out a recipe on how to build a bomb like this.\"That bomb is very similar to the one McVeigh used in Oklahoma City.\"McVeigh was deeply, deeply influenced by this book,\" Goodman adds. \"He sold it in gun shows, he quoted it, when he was arrested he had several pages of it in a folder beside him in a car. And it wasn\u2019t just McVeigh, it was all through this movement. People were really exorcised, impassioned, inflamed by this novel.\"FILE - In this May 5, 1995, photo, search and rescue personnel attend a memorial service in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma, destroyed by a fertilizer bomb in what is considered the first major domestic terrorist attack in the U.S.The documentary shows McVeigh obsessed with his guns and with the idea that the government was going to take them away. The film also points out that his exposure to the war in Iraq accelerated his feeling of mistrust of the U.S. government. \u201cThe way he put it made it sound he was emphatic towards the dead Iraqi soldiers that he killed. I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case,\u201d says Barak Goodman. Instead, says the filmmaker, it was McVeigh\u2019s mistrust of the U.S. government, how it had blundered into Iraq and his idea of the U.S. government as a bully, and McVeigh, says Goodman, hated bullies. The Ruby Ridge and Waco stand-offs reinforced that idea in his mind.Homegrown extremismAccording to the documentary, there are 500 militia organizations in the U.S. today. Goodman believes they are as radicalized as ever. \u201cSome of them have gotten rid of their camouflage outfits and put on suits and ties, but really the rhetoric has been virtually the same for 100 years or more. \u2018It\u2019s a whites-only country, it should be a whites-only country, the federal government is in the hands of Jews, blacks, it\u2019s a conspiracy.'\u201dGoodman says it is a misconception to believe that this is a movement of white poor disenfranchised people. Certainly, he says, many are, but there also many professionals feeling a loss of entitlement, a loss of privilege and power. The filmmaker stresses that these people operate outside political parties and share a deep mistrust of the Washington political establishment.But Goodman cautions these extremists are not de facto terrorists. He says it takes a confluence of opportunity and a warped personality, often a lone individual, to commit a terrorist act of a scale such as the Oklahoma City bombing.\u201cMcVeigh was a shock to most people in the FBI. It would be less of a shock today. But it\u2019s very hard to prevent these things. One of the takeaways from our film and audiences who have seen it have been amazed at how really easy it was to do this.

I want to make that clear,\u201d says Goodman. \u201cI would take issue with the idea that they have infiltrated the administration. But it is a little galling to see the really mono focus on terrorists from abroad, terrorists influenced by ideas from abroad, whatever those ideas might be, and not on any real discussion about home-grown terrorism which has always been with us and which is not going away and which is actually -- if you look at the numbers of the incidents -- rivaling or exceeding those by that other group,\u201d he adds.Goodman hopes his film, Oklahoma City, will call attention to this rising threat and contribute to the conversation on the inherent dangers of domestic terrorism.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker Terry Nichols <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Oklahoma City <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant McVeigh <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim David Koresh <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble build <extra_id_0> Artifact bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target Oklahoma City <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

Six months later, Russia sent the same warning to the C.I.A.On April 15, law enforcement officials say, Mr. Tsarnaev and his younger brother, Dzhokhar, set off bombs at the Boston Marathon, killing three people and maiming many others.The Russian warnings to the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. also raised questions about Mr. Tsarnaev\u2019s mother, Zubeidat, according to two senior American officials. The Russians were most concerned about Mr. Tsarnaev because they had information that he planned to travel to Russia, according to one of the officials. \u201cThe Russians were concerned that mother and son were very religious and strong believers, and they could be militants if they returned to Russia,\u201d the other official said.The mother, the officials said, did not fit the profile of a potential extremist, leading American counterterrorism officials to not express much concern about her.

The body will have the ability to dissolve state institutions and rewrite the constitution.Maduro has said his aim is to bring peace to the sharply split country caught up in political crisis and economic meltdown.But the president and his closest allies have also vowed to use the assembly to jail key opposition leaders, remove the country\u2019s outspoken chief prosecutor from her post and strip opposition legislators of their constitutional immunity.\u201cThe constituent assembly is the change so that this country can regain order. Anarchy is over, here,\u201d said Cilia Flores, Maduro\u2019s wife on receiving her accreditation as a member of the assembly. \u201cJustice will come starting tomorrow,\u201d she said.New doubts were cast on the official turnout for the assembly vote, after the company that provides the technological platform for Venezuela\u2019s voting system said on Wednesday that the government\u2019s claim that more than 8 million people voted on Sunday were wrong.\u201cWe know, without any doubt, that the turnout of the recent election for a national constituent assembly was manipulated,\u201d Antonio Mugica, the chief executive of Smartmatic, said in London.Mugica said Smartmatic detected the overstated turnout because of Venezuela\u2019s automated election system. \u201cWe estimate the difference between the actual participation and the one announced by authorities is at least 1m votes,\u201d he said.The electoral council president, Tibisay Lucena, put the turnout at 41.53%, or 8,089,320 people. The opposition put the number at between 2 million and 3 million.Only 3.7 million people had voted by 5.30pm in the constituent assembly election, according to internal electoral council data reviewed by Reuters, casting doubt on the 8.1 million people authorities said had voted that day. Voting lasted until 7pm.Lucena dismissed Mugica\u2019s allegations, calling it an \u201copinion\u201d of a company that played only a secondary role in the election and had no access to complete data. \u201cA company located outside the country does not guarantee the transparency and credibility of the Venezuelan electoral system,\u201d she said.Andr\u00e9s Izarra, a former information minister under Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, tweeted: \u201cCompany which supports Venezuelan electoral system confirms that election was manipulated by at least a million votes.\u201dAndr\u00e9s Izarra (@IzarraDeVerdad) Empresa que soporta sistema electoral vzlano confirma que elecci\u00f3n fue manipulada en al menos un mill\u00f3n de votos https://t.co/6Vn96SJi97His tweet \u2013 a rare display of criticism from a veteran Chavista \u2013 quickly went viral. In a follow-up tweet, Izarra said he recognized there are \u201cdoubts that must be cleared up about the results of Sunday\u2019s election\u201d but warned the opposition that he had not become one of them. \u201cSquallid ones, don\u2019t count on me EVER,\u201d he tweeted.Julio Borges, the leader of the opposition-held parliament, said voter fraud was \u201cthe most serious crime that can be committed against democracy\u201d.Meanwhile international pressure mounted on Maduro as his country and government became increasingly isolated, after two top political opponents under house arrest were dragged from their homes in midnight raids.The EU defied calls for sanctions against Venezuela\u2019s president after Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy proposed the member countries block travel by anyone linked to Maduro\u2019s government. However, the bloc warned that it was ready to action if there was any further dilution of the country\u2019s democratic institutions.Federica Mogherini, the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs, said in a statement that the union would not recognise the new constituent assembly due to \u201cconcerns over its effective representativeness and legitimacy\u201d.

{"text": "TORONTO (Reuters) - A homemade bomb set off last week by a Canadian man who was apparently inspired by Islamic State, failed to fully detonate, a senior police official told the National Post newspaper on Saturday.Slideshow ( 2 images )While there was a blast in the back seat of a taxi in Strathroy, Ontario, as police closed in, it came from the detonators, and explosive material did not go off, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) deputy commissioner Mike Cabana said.The RCMP could not immediately be reached for comment on the newspaper report.Aaron Driver, 24, was shot dead by police on Aug. 10 and the taxi company in the small town said the driver sustained only minor injuries in the blast.Cabana did not go into further detail on the bomb. He said forensic investigation was still underway. The target of what police have said was an attack plotted by Driver was unclear.Driver, who also used the alias Harun Abdurahman, was arrested last year for openly supporting Islamic State on social media, but was never charged with a crime. Islamic State militants control parts of Iraq and Syria and they have supporters and sympathizers around the world who have carried out attacks on civilians in several countries.In February, Driver was placed on a peace bond, a court order that restricted his movements. It required he stay away from social media and computers and not have contact with Islamic State or similar groups.The RCMP has said officers sought out Driver on Aug. 10 after a tip from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation that morning, which included a \u201cmartyrdom video.\u201dCabana said police identified Driver from the video in part through his choice of balaclava.The incident called into question Canada\u2019s capabilities to combat extremism and increased calls for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to abandon his plan to scale back a 2015 law that gave increased powers to police and intelligence agents.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack detonate <extra_id_0> Attacker who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast <extra_id_0> Target taxi <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Strathroy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim Aaron Driver <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Victim driver <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker Driver <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target target <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Harun Abdurahman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant Harun Abdurahman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place countries <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "With 24 hours to go until the biggest election in years, here\u2019s an oddity: the Government doesn\u2019t care who you vote for. Just as long as you vote.After the opposition\u2019s do-it-yourself election, the bar is high for chavismo to prove they still represent \u201cthe majority\u201d. But how do you convince people against their hearts? Proposals from each of the candidates, presented three times a day on national radio and TV cadenas, are more a joke than a real constitutional project.Chavismo\u2019s done what it can to give Sunday\u2019s election the look-and-feel of a major political event, but they\u2019ve come up short in both substance and style. Superficially, this election is just another rumba chavista. With the catchy song, a dog dancing, and the infamous candidate La M\u00e1scara.\u201cWe\u2019re going to knock on the door of anyone who gets confused\u2026 Our message is to vote, to consolidate what we have accomplished.\u201dThe farce element runs deep here. In reality there\u2019s no sense of anticipation at all, all candidates represent the same party. Out of the 537 constituents, perhaps 7 to 10 of them will make decisions: the other fivehundred-some-odd are purely filler, there to raise their hand on command. Which ones get elected matters exclusively to the individuals involved.Still, you need to get people to vote.But the real reason to vote has nothing to do with any cute song. It\u2019s fear.Venezuela has more than two million public sector workers, and each one is well aware that la masa no est\u00e1 pa\u2019 bollos.The time for subtle coaxing and coded messages is long gone. Chavismo\u2019s get-out-the-vote strategy consists of threatening them mercilessly.Maduro already said that voters must present their ID and Carnet de la Patria at the door of every voting center, \u201cto see who votes.\u201d\u201cIf we have 15,000 workers (in a public institution), all 15,000 must vote, no excuse\u201d, PSUV leader Diosdado Cabello said as he explained the way the Carnet de la Patria allows the government to keep track of who\u2019s voted and who hasn\u2019t, in real time.\u201cWe\u2019re going to knock on the door of anyone who gets confused,\u201d Diosdado went on. \u201cOur message is to vote, to consolidate what we have accomplished.\u201dAs for vice-president Tarek El Aissami, he is leveraging the CLAP grocery distribution: \u201cWe didn\u2019t let you die. Now it\u2019s your turn to not let the revolution die\u201d.And that\u2019s a bouquet of subtlety compared to ANC candidate and brother of late President Ch\u00e1vez, Ad\u00e1n Ch\u00e1vez, who said \u201cif we have to take up arms to defend the legacy of Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro, we will\u201d.The interior Minister, N\u00e9stor Reverol, decided that the threats will not be exclusive for chavista voters, assuring that now any meeting or protest that \u201ccan affect\u201d the election is prohibited, adding that this \u201ccrime\u201d will be be punished with 5 to 10 years in prison.The economic crisis is part of the campaign. Maduro has assured us that, with the Constituyente, all economic problems will be fixed, even raising the minimum wage weeks before the election.Some of the threats are startlingly direct\u2026Money talks, even in voting centers, but governor Vielma Mora took a step forward proposing that any \u201ccompany or person\u201d who doesn\u2019t vote, shouldn\u2019t participate in the Dicom foreign exchange system. As he sees it, that would be giving dollars \u201cto right wing terrorists.\u201dIt\u2019s legitimately scary when you realize he\u2019s not alone in this line of thought.These threats have crossed the country and even reached Colombian borders.

{"text": "(NaturalNews) The socialist \"revolution\" against democracy and free markets is proceeding in Venezuela, with the authoritarian government downplaying a mysterious disease outbreak as print media in the country slowly dies off.As reported by WPLG'sin Miami, there have been at least 10 deaths from the as-yet-unidentified disease. The deaths have occurred in several Venezuelan cities, including the capital of Caracas. As it spreads, the disease is creating panic among the population and has led some of the nation's physicians to sound the alarm.However, as WPLG reported, the warnings are being downplayed by the socialist government:However, though the government remains in denial mode, doctors in Venezuela are taking the threat seriously; they say there is genuine reason for concern, especially in a country where government policies have created nightmarish shortages of everything from basic food supplies to medicines. Plus, they say the disease is both dangerous and contagious.\"We do not know what it is,\" Duglas Leon Natera, president of the Venezuelan Medical Federation, said, according to WPLG.At first, those infected present with a fever and spots on the skin, which then produce large blisters followed by internal and external bleeding, says data provided by the College of Physicians in the state of Aragua, where the first cases were seen.From that point, the disease progresses very quickly; patients begin suffering from respiratory failure, then kidney failure. And thus far, Venezuelan doctors have not been able to figure out what they are dealing with, let alone a treatment plan.And the government is hindering the process, largely by denying that there even is \"a mysterious disease ,\" because that's what dictatorial, socialist leaders do: claim infallibility and blame others. One official called the doctors' information nothing but a \"media campaign against Venezuela .\"And the governor of the state of Aragua, Tarek El-Aissami, along with Communications Minister Delcy Rodriguez, has labeled the warnings a \"defamatory\" strategy to \"distress to the population.\"Doctors are not completely in the dark; some have speculated on what the disease might be. Theories include a new type of very aggressive, severe dengue fever and a different version of Chikungunya fever; some have even suggested that it could be Ebola.Meanwhile, as its people die, so, too, does Venezuela's ability to inform its people; the country's print media is slowing dying too, suffering from a lack of newsprint, as WPLG reported:According to a newly released report by the Institute for Press and Society of Venezuela, or IPYS, 34 newspapers and magazines in 11 states have reported in the past year chronic shortages and difficulties acquiring supplies and other materials to print, such as ink, film and plates.The situation has been made worse by the government's strict controls on acquiring foreign exchange, as well as interference in the internal processes of suppliers. An exchange rate control was enacted in the country 11 years ago; it required companies to apply for permits in order to purchase foreign currency and import goods. And newspaper owners have been saying it has been months since they were granted permits to buy newsprint.\"Due to the impossibility of securing newsprint and print materials, 10 print outlets have stopped circulating altogether and four others have halted circulation temporarily,\" WPLG reported. \"Others have reduced the number of pages per edition, sometimes by more than half, or stopped running during the weekend in order to survive.\"In fact, the report said, the oldest Venezuelan daily,, nearly shuttered recently.\"The newspaper industry is in a coma in Venezuela,\" the paper's president, Carlos Eduardo Carmona, said. \"The government is slowly killing the free press in Venezuela.\"As for the doctors who tried to warn the public? Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has ordered them prosecuted for \"a scheme of alarm, of psychological terrorism.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak outbreak <extra_id_0> Place Venezuela <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Disease disease <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact sound  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die die  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact inform  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "FBI Increases Reward for 2008 Times Square Bombing InformationNEW YORK \u2014\u00a0U.S. federal authorities on Wednesday announced an increased reward of $115,000 for information leading to the conviction of individuals responsible for the 2008 bombing in New York's Times Square.The FBI, which had offered a $65,000 reward in 2013, said it was actively pursuing several \"persons of interest,\" and has identified the origin of the explosive device's components.\"However, we're going to need more input and information from the general public if we're going to solve this case,\" Peter Tzitzis, an FBI special agent, told reporters.The bomb exploded at about 3:45 a.m. local time on March 6, 2008, at the Armed Forces Recruiting Station, a small, stand-alone building in the heart of Times Square. No one was wounded by the blast which caused only minor damage.Authorities have said a suspect on a blue Ross bicycle dismounted, placed the bomb at the recruiting station, lit the fuse and fled. The bicycle was found in a dumpster several blocks away.The suspect appeared to be working alone but could have had a lookout or a surveillance team of as many as five others, authorities said.At a press conference on Wednesday, FBI and New York Police Department officials said they believed the person who planted the device was male and that the incident was not tied to any foreign organizations.The explosion might be connected to two other New York bombings, one at the British Consulate in 2005 and another at the Mexican Consulate in 2007, the FBI said.The consulate bombs were also placed by someone on a bicycle and detonated between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m., authorities said.The explosive device used in Times Square was detonated with a time fuse and built using an ammunition can commonly found on battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, the FBI said.The announcement of the new reward came as Boston marked the second anniversary of the attack on its annual marathon that killed three people and injured 264.While no one was harmed in the Times Square incident, the FBI said the case remained a \"top priority.\"In May 2013, Gerald Koch, a self-described anarchist from Brooklyn, was jailed after refusing to testify as a witness before a federal grand jury thought to be investigating the explosion. A federal judge ordered Koch's release in January 2014.The FBI's Tzitzis said several other individuals have come forward with information and \"good progress\" was being made.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Armed Forces Recruiting Station <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Times Square <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 264 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain jailed <extra_id_0> Detainee Gerald Koch <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "2 New Arrests in London Terror AttackLondon police said Friday they have made two more arrests in connection with the attack near Parliament.Counter-terrorism commander Mark Rowley characterized the arrests as \u201csignificant,\u201d though he did not provide any details. He said nine people are currently in custody and one person has been released.Police officials identified the attacker who killed four people near Parliament as Khalid Masood, a Briton who converted to Islam and had a lengthy criminal record for weapons possession and other charges.Rowley said Masood\u2019s birth name was Adrian Russell Ajao and appealed to the public for any information about him.A woman holds up a sign at a vigil for the victims of Wednesday's attack, at Trafalgar Square in London, March 23, 2017. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for an attack by a man who plowed an SUV into pedestrians and then stabbed a police officer.\u201cWe remain keen to hear from anyone who knew Khalid Masood well, understands who his associates were and can provide us with information about places he has recently visited,\u2019\u2019 Rowley said. \u201cThere might be people out there who did have concerns about Masood but did not feel comfortable for whatever reason in passing those concerns to us.\u2019\u2019Islamic State said Masood, who was 52, was a \u201csoldier\u201d of the extremist group who responded to its call to attack civilians and the military in countries allied with the United States in battling IS.Masood had never been convicted of terrorist offenses, but British security officials said he had been investigated in the past \u201cin relation to concerns about violent extremism.\u201d Authorities say they believe he was acting alone Wednesday when he ran down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, a Thames River crossing leading to the Houses of Parliament, crashed his rented vehicle into a gate and fatally stabbed a policeman who tried to stop him.Armed police shot and killed Masood moments later.A property in Birmingham, England, was searched by police following Wednesday's London attack, March 23, 2017.In the hours after Wednesday\u2019s attack in the heart of London, police conducted raids around the country in search of anyone who may have given support to Masood. Eight men and women were arrested Thursday on suspicion of planning terrorist acts.The dead assailant, who was older than most Islamist attackers involved in recent spectacular terror attacks in Europe, had been a teacher of English and was known as a fanatical bodybuilder.One of the civilians who was run down on the bridge, a 75-year-old man, died Thursday in a hospital, raising the casualty toll to four victims and Masood.Although Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, a statement posted online did not implicate the group in the planning or execution of the attack.An Italian tourist who witnessed the carnage told reporters he saw Masood attack the policeman with two knives. \u201cHe gave [the officer] around 10 stabs in the back,\u201d the visitor said.Valiant efforts to resuscitate Constable Keith Palmer at the scene failed. The 48-year-old officer was a 15-year police veteran.One American was among the dead - 54-year-old Kurt Cochran of Utah, who was in London with his wife to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. His wife, Melissa, was among the 30 people injured. Masood\u2019s vehicle hit the Cochrans as they crossed Westminster Bridge.The remaining victim of the attack was a British school administrator, Aysha Frade, 43.Candles burn on Westminster Bridge the day after an attack in London, March 23, 2017.Mourners gathered in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square Thursday evening, about one kilometer from the crime scene, for a candlelight vigil. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told the crowd of thousands that\u201dthose trying to destroy our shared way of life will never succeed.\u201dKhan said the vigil in the most recognizable public plaza in London was meant to honor the dead and injured, but also \u201cto send a clear, clear message: Londoners will never be cowed by terrorism.\u201dRowley, head of counterterrorism efforts for London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service, said the eight people arrested Thursday were picked up during searches at six separate locations, and that investigations were continuing in London, Birmingham and other parts of England. He declined to say whether or how those detained were involved in Wednesday\u2019s attack.\u201cIt is still our belief, which continues to be born out by our investigation, that this attacker acted alone and was inspired by international terrorism,\u201d Rowley told reporters.Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May gives a media statement outside 10 Downing street in London, March 22, 2017, following a terror attack in the Westminster area of London earlier Wednesday.Prime Minister Theresa May struck a defiant tone in discussing the attack before Parliament Thursday, telling British lawmakers that what London experienced was \u201can attack on free people everywhere.\u201d\u201cYesterday an act of terrorism tried to silence our democracy, but today we meet as normal, as generations have done before us and as future generations will continue to do, to deliver a simple message: We are not afraid and our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism,\u201d she said.May thanked Britain\u2019s friends and allies around the world \u201cwho have made it clear that they stand with us at this time.\u201dShe said the victims include nationals of France, Romania, South Korea, Germany, Poland, Ireland, China, Italy and Greece, as well as the United States.The United Nations Security Council in New York, chaired by British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, observed a moment of silence Thursday for the London victims.Tense London Carries on After Islamic State AttackVideo sizewidthxheightpixelsTense London Carries on After Islamic State AttackShare this video0:02:20\u25b60:00:00/0:02:20\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 6.3MB360p | 9.3MB720p | 61.6MB\u201cYou may know that today there are victims in London from 11 nations.

GUTI\u00c9RREZ / EFEVenezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has countered reports of an incipient epidemic in the country by accusing the opposition of engaging in underhand tactics.\u201cThey tried to impose a campaign of psychological warfare on Venezuela, a combination of alarmism and war,\u201d said Maduro. \u201cThere is no other term for this but psychological warfare.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, the Bolivarian leader \u2013 who is the political heir of the deceased former president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \u2013 went further and asked the World Health Organization to help investigate alleged attempts to introduce \u201csome sort of virus\u201d into the country as part of \u201cbiological warfare.\u201dPatients at the Maracay Hospital are dying in the space of 72 hours due to massive hemorrhagingThe latest cause for concern involves Maracay Hospital, located around two hours from Caracas, where it emerged last Thursday that some patients were displaying worrying symptoms.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what it is we are facing,\u201d said Angel Sarmiento, president of the Medical Association of Aragua, the state where the hospital is located. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it is a virus or a bacteria.\u201dThe physician added that patients were dying in the space of 72 hours due to a massive hemorrhage, and he recommended that people avoid going to that hospital.The government reacted to this statement by calling Sarmiento \u201ca fascist\u201d and \u201ca terrorist.\u201d The governor of Aragua, Tareck El Aissami, filed a complaint against him before the Attorney\u2019s Office, claiming that there are no dangerous bacteria at the hospital and discrediting Sarmiento because he is a member of the opposition.But the Medical Federation of Venezuela has come out in support of Sarmiento.\u201cHow long will this routine go on? Every time someone tells this government the truth in connection with a disease, an economic problem or a security issue, that person automatically becomes a coup-plotter,\u201d said Douglas N\u00e1tera, president of the federation.Health Minister Nancy P\u00e9rez, who has held that portfolio for just a few days, made a public statement on Wednesday to address the growing social alarm.\u201cThe main thing is that there is no strange virus right now.

Another 1,200 patients are under observation.But Rafael Arreaza, a surgeon and former director of Venezuela\u2019s Social Security service, questioned the minister\u2019s figures and filed a complaint against the government with the Ombudsman.Arreaza said that for every patient diagnosed with Chikungunya, there could be as many as 1,000 more, and that the lack of lab material is preventing health workers from knowing the true magnitude of the problem.This former health official also said that 12 of the victims who died were showing similar symptoms, suggesting the need to find out whether the virus is mutating.In the face of this mounting pressure, President Maduro said he will take national and international legal action against any physician but also against any journalist, media outlet or individual who contributes to disseminating this theory through words or images.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak disease <extra_id_0> Place Venezuela <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak Chikungunya <extra_id_0> Victim patient <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak Chikungunya <extra_id_0> Victim patient <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak virus <extra_id_0> Victim victims <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Amid speculation that President Bush is reconsidering what will constitute \"regime change in Iraq,\" one thing should be clear: Saddam Hussein's willingness to \"change\" his attitude towards permitting the resumption of intrusive on-site U.N. weapons inspections will not, in fact, eliminate the danger posed by him and his ruling clique.Indeed, what would be, at best, an ephemeral attitudinal adjustment on Saddam's part would probably not even diminish meaningfully the threat from Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs. After all, were Saddam -- against all odds and past practice -- actually to cooperate with the U.N. inspectors and assist in the complete elimination of his chemical and biological arsenals, he could resume covertly stockpiling them again in as little as six-months time.That period could be still shorter if he were to be rewarded for his \"cooperation\" by the elimination of international economic and trade sanctions against Iraq.A news item published in the London Evening Standard last Monday provides, however, an important reminder of why the United States cannot safely accept any substitute for the toppling of Saddam's regime.Specifically, it summarizes evidence implicating Saddam Hussein in one or more deadly acts of terror against the United States, specifically the Oklahoma City bombing.The Standard article draws on investigative reporting and forensic analysis into the Oklahoma City bombing performed over the past seven years by an intrepid and tenacious former TV journalist, Jayna Davis. She offers compelling, if circumstantial, indications that Iraqi operatives helped to plot, prepare and execute murderous attacks in Oklahoma City (and perhaps against other targets in the United States).For example, Ms. Davis has identified a man whose photo matches that of a \"John Doe #2\" sought immediately after the Murrah Building attack. He appears to be a Palestinian by the name of Hussain Hashem Al Hussaini, who sported a tatoo suggesting he had served in Saddam's elite Republican Guard.According to Davis' evidence, witnesses put Al Hussaini in the company of confessed bomber Timothy McVeigh a few days before the attack and near the site immediately beforehand. Ms. Davis has also found witnesses who say McVeigh and his convicted co-conspirator, Terry Nichols, had consorted with former Iraqi soldiers. Some of these former soldiers worked for a Palestinian who owned a truck very like one sought after the attack. These soldiers reportedly were absent from work on the day of the bombing and were seen celebrating after it occurred. It strains credulity that all of these dots are not connected.What is more, Ms. Davis' evidence appears consistent with findings by another investigator, Dr. Laurie Mylroie, who has devoted years of effort to the pursuit of Iraqi connections to the earlier World Trade Center bombing. Like Ms. Davis, Dr. Mylroie concludes that Saddam's modus operandi is to employ cut-outs to cover his tracks.According to this thesis, the first attempt aimed at destroying the Twin Towers was not exclusively accomplished by followers of a blind Egyptian sheik with ties to Iran. This conclusion was actually a bonus for Hussein, because it vectored blame at Iran, his most formidable enemy and neighbor. Similarly, Oklahoma City was not, as prosecutors claimed, simply the homegrown handiwork of two violently disaffected U.S. citizens.And Sept. 11 was not the product solely of Usama bin Laden's al Qaeda network. In each of these cases, there is reason to believe that Saddam Hussein and his minions played some role in the murder of Americans.To be sure, it is not exactly news that Ms. Davis has concluded that Iraqi operatives were involved in Oklahoma City. What is news is that, according to the Evening Standard, the Bush Justice Department has apparently, finally begun to take a serious interest in Ms. Davis' evidence.Such evidence simply serves strongly to reinforce a reality of which President Bush has long and repeatedly warned: We will enjoy no relief from Saddam's predations unless and until he and his ilk are removed from power in Iraq.The memory of those Americans who have already been murdered by the Butcher of Baghdad and his co-conspirators will be besmirched -- and the fate of untold numbers of their countrymen recklessly jeopardized -- if a temporary adjustment to Saddam's behavior on inspections were to be confused with, and allowed to substitute for, the needed elimination of his regime.Frank J.

[this is] cynical, cowardly,\" said Lavrov, who went on to point a finger at the previous U.S. administration. \"Sadly, this is not just a media fabrication: certain figures, including representatives of Obama administration\u2019s Pentagon, have shared similar thoughts with the world community.\u201dCity on edgeThe attack has left St. Petersburg residents on edge.St. Petersburg emergency services responded Tuesday morning to a bomb threat at a subway station near Monday\u2019s deadly blast on a train as it was passing between two stations. After receiving an anonymous call, police went to clear pedestrians from the area.Blast victims lie near a subway train hit by a explosion at the Tekhnologichesky Institut subway station in St.Petersburg, Russia, April 3, 2017.Reporters on the scene said fire trucks and ambulances quickly arrived. Authorities briefly closed subway stations. They searched for an unattended item before re-opening the stations. Russian media reports said the law department at St. Petersburg University was also evacuated because of a suspicious package.\u201cI think the atmosphere in the city is nervous,\u201d said one resident who only gave her first name \u2014 Anastasia. \u201cPeople walk and they do not understand what is happening. The public transport is too busy and is not coping. It is scary for us.\u201dRussia is holding three days of mourning for those killed. President Putin overnight laid flowers near the bombing cite in St. Petersburg in tribute. Putin was in the city when the bombing occurred, the timing of which Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called \u201cfood for thought.\u201dA man lays flowers in memory of victims killed by a bomb blast in a subway train in St. Petersburg, at the memorial stone with the word Leningrad (St. Petersburg) at the Tomb of Unknown Soldier, in front of the Kremlin wall in Moscow, April 4, 2017.Ordinary Russians paid respects as well, laying flowers and messages at a makeshift memorial outside the subway stations in St. Petersburg and at the Leningrad Hero City memorial in front of the Kremlin wall in Moscow.Meanwhile, authorities are investigating what may have motivated the bombing, the first ever in Russia\u2019s second largest city.The most recent subway attack was in Moscow in 2010, when female suicide bombers connected to an Islamist insurgency in Chechnya were blamed for killing at least 33 people.

But he added that ETA remained the ''main line of investigation.''He said more than 220 pounds of dynamite packed into backpacks had been used in the attacks.Arnaldo Otegi, leader of Batasuna, ETA's political wing, which has been banned in Spain, said ETA probably was not behind the attacks. He said the attack could have been the work of ''Arab resistance.''Another senior Spanish official said in an interview that the bombs used titadine, a kind of compressed dynamite found in a van containing 1,100 pounds of explosives that was intercepted last month as it headed for Madrid. Two suspected ETA members were arrested at the time.The official added that the government believed that the dynamite was stolen from France three years ago. ''This material has a kind of signature on it,'' the official said.On Dec. 24, the police foiled a plot that would have detonated two bombs in a train after it arrived at a Madrid station. They seized a man with a bomb in San Sebasti\u00e1n, a Basque city. He had a ticket for the train, and when the police halted the train and searched it, they found a second bomb.The letter claiming responsibility for the attack on Thursday was delivered to Al Quds Al Arabi, a London-based Arab newspaper.

{"text": "DJI responds to drone attacks: \u201cWe have limited ability to control what people do with our products\u201dThe world\u2019s largest drone manufacturer, DJI, has issued a statement after two of their drones armed with explosives were used in an apparent assassination attempt against Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro last week.The drones in question appeared to be Matrice 600s; commercial-level UAVs intended for aerial photography and costing around $5000 each.The Venezuelan government claims that each Matrice was packed with a kilo of C4 and were intended to kill Maduro and other important Venezuelan political figures.https://www.wetalkuav.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1024x576_MP4_4439375926361635711.mp4A video of the drone exploding from media at the eventDJI spoke with Dezeen magazine and told them that \"DJI makes products purely for peaceful purposes.\"\"While we build some prudent safety and security features into our products, we have limited ability to control what people do with them.\"They stated that the overwhelming majority of DJI drone operators use their drones peacefully, and they \"deplore any use of our products to bring harm to anyone.\"\"As with any technology, if people decide to misuse our products in any way, they have to be responsible for their actions,\" they said.Two DJI Matrice 600\u2019s were seemingly used in an attack against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela last week.Who was responsible for the drone attacks and why did they fail?It is, as yet, unclear who exactly was reponsible for the attacks.One group calling themselves \u2018Soldiers in T-shirts\u2018 claimed responsibility on Twitter.Maduro alleged Venezuela\u2019s ultra-right in alliance with Colombia\u2019s ultra-right and their outgoing president, Juan Manuel Santos were behind the assassination attempt.The Venezuelan government has used the attacks as justification for a further crackdown on political opponents and have arrested at least 6 people.Neither drone ultimately made it to their intended targets.According to Venezuela\u2019s Attorney General, this was because they were deflected from reaching their intended course through protective radio emissions eminating from Venzuelan intelligence personnel (similar to drone killing devices we\u2019ve written about previously).Video footage from multiple angles since the attack suggest that one drone exploded above the soldiers on parade (causing 7 injuries) while the other crashed into the window of an apartment, causing the apartment to catch fire (this was initially reported in some outlets as the result of gas explosion).The website Bellingcat has an excellent rundown of all evidence related to the drone attack including video footage and photos from multiple angles, if you\u2019re interested.A soldier injured by the exploding drone at the Venezualan National Guard celebration parade in CaracasDespite some claims in media, it seems unlikely the government would stage an attack against itself.As the Economist noted, \"Dictators depend on projecting an image of omnipotence\u2026 in the television footage, Mr Maduro looked befuddled; the massed ranks of the National Guard broke discipline and ran off in panic.\"In essence, the attacks made Maduro look weak, not strong.False flag operations have happened throughout history but thus far, this does not appear to be one of them.Story continues on page 2", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble armed <extra_id_0> Artifact drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime assassination <extra_id_0> Victim president <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble packed <extra_id_0> Artifact Matrice <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components C4 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack kill <extra_id_0> Target Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice C4 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploding <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target Nicol\u00e1s Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument Matrice 600\u2019s <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument other <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim soldier <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploding <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target soldier <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker government <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Accused Boston Bomber Followed Brother's Lead, Defense Argues BOSTON \u2014\u00a0Accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev followed his older brother's lead in carrying out the 2013 bombing that killed three people, rather than acting on his own motivation, one of his attorneys argued on Monday.Tsarnaev, 21, could be sentenced to death if a jury finds him guilty of carrying out the April 15, 2013, attack and fatally shooting a police officer three days later as he and his brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, tried to flee the city.Following the prosecution's closing argument, that the ethnic Chechen defendant was an extremist who had \"wanted to punish America\" with the bombing attack, Tsarnaev's lawyers argued that he had been in the thrall of his older brother.Defense attorney Judith Clarke, who opened the trial last month by admitting that her client had committed all the crimes of which he is accused, repeated that assertion on Monday.\"There is no excuse. No one is trying to make one. Planting bombs at the Boston Marathon one year and 51 weeks ago was a senseless act,\" Clarke said.But in a counterpoint to the blunt \"it was him\" admission of her opening statement, Clarke told the jury that Tamerlan, who died four days after the bombing following a gunfight with police, had planned the attack and built the bombs.\"Tamerlan did that,\" she said. \"We need to understand who was leading and who was following.\"By shifting some of the blame to the older brother, Tsarnaev's lawyers are trying to persuade the jury, if they find the defendant guilty, to sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of parole rather than death.The jury on Monday also viewed video of Tsarnaev standing with a backpack in the crowd at the marathon's finish line minutes before the blasts that killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, 23, and 8-year-old Martin Richard.Tsarnaev is also accused of the fatal shooting of Massachusetts of Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, 26.'Wanted to Punish America'Prosecutors argued that the younger Tsarnaev shared his brother's violent ideology.\"The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahedeen, the holy warriors,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. \"He wanted to terrorize this country. He wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people.\"Chakravarty noted that evidence showed that Tsarnaev, who moved to the United States from Russia a decade before the attack, had copies of al-Qaida's \"Inspire\" magazine on his computers.\"These were political choices,\" he said of Tsarnaev's actions. \"He was making a statement, 'an eye for an eye.'\"Hours after the gunfight with police, which ended when Dzhokhar sped off in a car, running his brother over in the process, the defendant hid in a boat parked in a backyard. While there, he wrote a note suggesting the attack was an act of retribution for U.S. military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries.Monday's closing statements could be a preview of the arguments each side plans to make during the next phase of the trial, when the same jury will hear a fresh round of witness testimony before determining whether to sentence Tsarnaev to life in prison without possibility of parole, or to death.Richard's parents, William and Denise; dancer Heather Abbott, who lost both legs in the blast, and former Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis were among the people who packed the courtroom for closing arguments.The defendant sat quietly in court on Monday, dressed in a white shirt, dark jacket and no tie. He did not speak.The surveillance video viewed by the jury on Monday shows a bomb, which the defendant is charged with leaving in front of the Forum restaurant near the finish line, going off with a blinding flash, killing Richard and Lu. The jury also saw video taken by a man injured in the blast.The graphic video captures the chaos of the immediate aftermath, with one responder yelling that he was worried about the possibility of an additional blast and another voice screaming, \"We're on fire here.

Beginning at 7:37 am and continuing for several minutes, 10 bombs exploded on four trains in and around Atocha Station in the city\u2019s centre, leaving 191 dead and more than 1,800 injured. Occurring just three days before Spain\u2019s general elections, the attacks had major political consequences.Madrid; terrorism Rescue workers evacuating the bodies of victims of a terrorist train bombing near Atocha Station, Madrid, March 11, 2004. Paul White\u2014AP/REX/Shutterstock.comBritannica Quiz History Makers: Fact or Fiction? Albert Einstein believed that mathematics problems should have very complex solutions.Both the Spanish government and the Spanish media immediately attributed the bombings to ETA, a Basque separatist organization whose campaign of violence over more than 30 years had claimed the lives of at least 800 people. Indeed, \u00c1ngel Acebes, the country\u2019s interior minister, claimed, \u201cThere is no doubt ETA is responsible.\u201d In an outpouring of grief and defiance, the following day an estimated 11 million Spaniards, including some 2.3 million in Madrid alone, participated in demonstrations against the violence and in support of the victims. This display of unity rapidly broke down, however, as the police investigation began to focus on the Islamist militant group al-Qaeda. On March 13, as the first arrests were being made, the government continued to blame ETA.That evening spontaneous protests took place in Madrid, Barcelona, and other cities as demonstrators chanted, \u201cWe want to know the truth before we vote.\u201d With some 90 percent of Spaniards opposed to Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar\u2019s support for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, the Islamic connection inevitably put Iraq back on top of the political agenda.

{"text": "Roadside bomb kills 15 civilians in northern AfghanistanOfficials say families were on their way to a wedding party when their vehicle hit an improvised explosive device.At least 15 Afghan civilians, including six women and eight children, were killed when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb in Afghanistan\u2018s northern Kunduz province.Mahbubullah Sayedi, district chief of Imam Sahib, which was the scene of heavy fighting between government forces and Taliban fighters in recent months, said the incident occurred on a main road.\u201cThe families were on their way to a wedding ceremony when, unfortunately, their vehicle hit a roadside bomb that killed them,\u201d Sayedi said.The provincial governor, Abdul Jabar Naeemi, said the area where the incident happened is controlled by the Taliban, whom he blamed for the tragedy.Elsewhere in the country, local media reported at least 13 civilians were wounded in a car bomb explosion in Sar-e-Pul province.Quoting Noor Agha Faizi, spokesman for the Sar-e-Pul police, TOLO News said the explosion took place as the \u201cTaliban were trying to move a car full of explosives to the centre of the province.\u201dAs the conflict between the foreign-backed Afghan government forces and Taliban fighters has dragged on for more than 18 years, civilians continue to bear the brunt of war with record numbers of casualties.At least 3,812 civilians were killed and wounded in the first half of this year in violent incidents across the country.In the same period, 144 women and 327 children were killed and more than 1,000 more wounded, the UN said.Pro-government forces killed 717 Afghans and wounded 680 in the six months to June 30 \u2013 a 31 percent increase from 2018.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die kills <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Afghanistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack hit <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosive device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim children <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Kunduz province <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack hit <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim them <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place country <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim women <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim 1,000 more <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Killer forces <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim Afghans <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim 680 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injurer forces <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact say <extra_id_0> Participant Officials <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Mahbubullah Sayedi <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Abdul Jabar Naeemi <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Noor Agha Faizi <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant UN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "A report by the United Nations Human Rights Council has called for independent investigations to be carried out into drone attacks after a series of strikes that result in unexpected civilian deaths in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere. Most of the attacks involved US drones.In a 21-page report, the UN special rapporteur on human rights, Ben Emmerson, records a dramatic reduction in drone strikes in 2013 in Pakistan but increases in Afghanistan and, towards the end of the year, in Yemen.The decline in drone strikes in Pakistan comes after its government's repeated calls for the US to reduce their number. Islamabad argued that the impact of drone strikes was counterproductive, turned opinion in the country against the US and undermined the Pakistani government.But Emmerson noted a threefold increase in recorded civilian casualties from drone strikes in Afghanistan in 2013. He concluded that states have an obligation to launch inquiries into cases in which civilians become caught up.His report said: \"Having regard to the duty of states to protect civilians in armed conflict, the special rapporteur concluded that in any case in which there have been, or appear to have been, civilian casualties that were not anticipated when the attack was planned, the state responsible is under an obligation to conduct a prompt, independent and impartial fact-finding inquiry and to provide a detailed public explanation of the results.\"This obligation would be triggered whenever there is a plausible indication from any apparently reliable source that unintended civilian casualties may have been sustained.\"The proposal is likely to form the basis for a draft resolution to be debated by the UNHRC in Geneva, Switzerland.Emmerson devoted a large part of the report to listing specific drone strikes involving civilians. He said he had identified 30 attacks out of a total of 37 brought to his attention in which civilians had been killed, suffered life-threatening injuries or been put at risk.In Afghanistan, Emmerson, who travelled widely for the report, said that up to the end of 2012 drone strikes \"appeared to have inflicted significantly lower levels of civilians casualties than aerial attacks carried out by other air platforms. This is no longer the position.\"In 2013, drone attacks accounted for 40% of the total number of civilian fatalities from air strikes. There were 45 civilian fatalities and 14 non-fatal injuries, a threefold increase compared with 2012.In Pakistan, he recorded \"a marked drop\" in civilian casualties since 2012. \"Figures to the end of 2013 confirm that there has been a significant de-escalation in the number of recorded drone strikes in Pakistan,\" he said. Strikes were down to 27 in 2013 from a peak of 128 in 2010, and for the first time in nine years there had been no civilian casualties reported.\"At the time of writing, there have been no reported drone strikes during 2014, the longest pause since President Obama took office,\" Emmerson said.The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which monitors media reports on drones strikes, reported last month that there had been no known drone strikes in Pakistan since 25 December. US officials say the lull was a response to requests by the Pakistani government, which has been trying to launch peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban.In Yemen, Emmerson was told that the US routinely sought prior consent for attacks, although Human Rights Watch has quoted the Yemeni government as saying they were not pre-approved.In Israel, he said the government stressed it aimed for zero civilian casualties, saying it provided advance warning of attacks where possible. But Emmerson \"identified a number of sample strikes in which there are credible allegations that civilians were killed or injured as the result of Israeli drone strikes in Gaza\".Kat Craig, legal director of Reprieve, the legal charity which has been campaigning on the issue, said: \"In Yemen, Pakistan and elsewhere, the US, assisted by its European allies, is carrying out devastating attacks with total impunity \u2013 a practice that is terrorising local communities, and creating far more extremism than it has ever eliminated.\"It is high time that the US provided full accountability and transparency around its use of drones, and investigated civilian casualties. This report will only increase pressure on the US to bring their covert programme out of the shadows.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigations <extra_id_0> Investigator United Nations Human Rights Council <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strikes <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place elsewhere <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact talks <extra_id_0> Participant government <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Pakistani <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigated <extra_id_0> Defendant US <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strikes <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Gaza <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Israeli <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "The 2019 Quetta bombing was a suicide bomb attack on an open marketplace in Quetta, Pakistan on 12 April, killing 21 people.The bombing took place near an area where many minority Shiite Muslims live.At least ten Hazara, including nine Shiites, were among the dead.Two paramilitary soldiers were also killed in the bombing.PM Imran Khan expressed condolences for the lives lost, directed the authorities to ensure the best medical treatment for the injured, and ordered an increase in security for Shiites and Hazara people.Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and ISIL later accepted responsibility for the attack, stating that \"their target were Hazara people.\"== Background ==Hazaras have been frequently targeted by Taliban and Islamic State militants and other Sunni Muslim militant groups in both

predominantly Shia.== Blast ==A suicide attack was carried out in the late afternoon of 12 April 2019 by the Sunni militant at a potato stall in a crowded Hazarganji vegetable market.One survivor reported the blast being so powerful that the air was filled with black smoke and people were unable to hear each other.20 people including one paramilitary soldier were killed, as well as the perpetrator.On 16 April, one more paramilitary soldier died of his injuries.== Responsibility ==Initially, no group claimed responsibility for the blast.After some hours, the leader of Sunni militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for the attack and issued a warning that more attacks were planned.A spokesperson of the group, Qari Saifullah, told CNN \"We claim responsibility for the attack in Quetta, we targeted the Hazara community.\"The same group had previously carried out attacks against Hazara minorities.ISIL also claimed the responsibility of this attack, releasing a photograph of the bomber along with his name.Various Sunni militant groups in Pakistan, including  Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, have been backed by ISIL for several years.== Reaction ==Pakistan's ruling

targeted but they weren\u2019t provided effective security.\"Provincial Home Minister Zia Lango visited the site but dialogue with the Hazara community failed once again on security purposes.Hazaras demanded security from Prime Minister Imran Khan.Shortly after the bombing struck near a Shiite residential area, dozens of angry Shiite youths rallied in Quetta, demanding more security from the authorities and the arrest of those behind the attacks.They also denounced the violence by Sunni extremists who have killed hundreds in similar attacks over the past years in Balochistan province.\"It seems people from the (Shiite) Hazara community were the target,\" said senior police chief Abdur Razzaq Cheema.Members of the Hazara community staged a sit-in at Quetta's Western Bypass for over 23 hours, demanded better security measures following the blast.Women and children are among those who staged a sit-in since shortly after the blast.The protesters demanded that the government implements an effective security plan and ensure the protection of the Hazara community.Pakistani Shiite youth from Hazara community burn tires to block the main road during a protest to condemn the attack.Hazara protesters refuse to end the Quetta sit-in even after the third day, with protesters continuing to block the western bypass.Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Syed Ali Haider Zaidi arrived in the provincial capital and met the affected families on the behalf of Prime Minister Imran Khan, stating \"Federal government claimed full responsibility of protecting its citizens regardless of their caste, creed, religion or province and Government is taking strict action and seriously pursuing the investigations into the suicide attack.\"However, the protesters refused to call off their sit-in, demanded the attendance of Prime Minister Imran Khan, the capture of people behind the suicide attack and security of Hazara people.Representing the protesters, advocate Tahir Hazara expressed dismay over the federal government's attitude and regretted that Prime Minister Imran Khan had no time to visit Quetta after the tragic incident.However, he stated no one was safe in Quetta, saying that along with ordinary people, security personnel too had been martyred, adding that it raised questions over the capabilities of the government.He said the state must act without further delay because the people were tired of lifting the coffins of their loved ones.Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) president Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal visited the protest camp of the Hazara community and expressed solidarity with the protestors.A large number of people also staged a protest demonstration outside the Quetta Press Club after marching on main roads, protests erupted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Punjab too.After 4 days, the Hazara community ends sit-in after receiving assurances from state minister, Balochistan CM.However, protesters still demanded Imran Khan

practical for our protection.\"Minister of state of Interior Shehryar Khan Afridi had visited the Imam Bargah located in Hazara town to condole with the bereaved family members, speaking to the media, Afridi said \"The federal government will play its role in making sure that these heinous crimes end, I stand  with the community and I assure you that the government has been working to ensure that

president had reaffirmed the government's commitment towards the implementation of the National Action Plan and  commended CM Balochistan's commitment of announcing a compensation package for the victims.Meanwhile, Opposition Leader Bilawal Zardari condemns the government and point out their duel standards, he said, \"On one hand they say the government is standing with the victims of the incident, and on the other a video exists where a federal minister is seen giving assurances to murderers and saying that no one will be able to touch them, Till when will have these dual standards, till when will this terrorism continue, victims need to be mainstreamed not terrorists.\"He showed condolence to the victims and also praised the army for eliminating the terrorists in recent years but he also provoked the emotional sentiments, stated, \u201cNo one can fight extremism alone, but we have to decide for the future.We need to fight this extremist mindset.When we ask for justice, we are called an enemy of the state.When I speak against banned organisations, I\u2019m branded an enemy of the state.\"he referred to his recent controversy where he was accused of using the Indian

{"text": "The 1995 Rijeka bombing occurred on 20 October 1995 in Rijeka, Croatia, when an Islamic terrorist organization attempted to destroy a police station by driving a car with a bomb into the wall of the building.Twenty-seven employees in the police station and two bystanders on the street were injured, although the only person killed was the attacker.== Cause ==In the last days of the Bosnian War, the Croatian Defense Council (HVO), a Bosnian Croat military force, captured Talaat Fouad Qasim when he attempted to enter Bosnia and Herzegovina.Qasim, an important member of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, was soon transferred to Egypt with the active help of Croatia.Because of that and because Croatia had de facto controlled the Croatian Defence Council, the military organization which had captured Talaat Fouad Qasim, a decision was made to commit a terrorist attack in Croatia.== The attack ==At 11:21\u00a0a.m. Central European Time, a Fiat 131 Mirafiori entered the parking lot of the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County police headquarters.Due to the 90-degree turn needed to enter the lot, the vehicle moved slowly.Near the entrance, the driver did not park in the parking spaces for civilians, but instead started to accelerate towards the wall at the end of the parking lot.Due to the low security measures, this incident was not noticed before the attack itself took place.After 15\u201320 meters, passing 8-10 available parking spaces in the small lot, the Fiat crashed into the stairs leading to the police station and exploded.The time of explosion was recorded as 11:22\u00a0a.m. local time (10:22\u00a0UTC).Subsequently, a police investigation found out the car was loaded with  of highly-explosive TNT.The police also found a part of a Canadian passport inside the remains of the attacker's car.The next day, representatives of the al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya terrorist organization from Egypt claimed responsibility for the attack, requesting extradition of Qasim.Due to an error made by the attackers, the bombing did not cause fatalities, aside from the suicide bomber himself.The police headquarters is located on a higher ground than the parking lot itself, requiring the stairs in the first place.The other apparent miscalculation involved the size of the parking lot, where the Fiat 131 had neither the space and velocity, nor the horsepower, to climb the stairs and destroy the police station wall.As a result, the police station failed to collapse and only 29 injuries were recorded (including two unaware bystanders).The bomb also carved a large crater in the ground, battering nearby buildings and destroying vehicles.== Aftermath ==With the help of the CIA, officials examined the video footage of the attack.American and Croatian investigative sources came to the conclusion that Hassan al-Sharif Mahmud Saad had organized this attack.Saad had come to live in Bosnia only that year; previously, he had been living in Italy.Soon after the attack, Bosnian officials discovered that Saad was planning a new terrorist attack, against NATO forces, which was to happen in December 1995.A few days after that attack failed, he was killed in central Bosnia in a firefight with Croatian Defense Council forces.== See also ==*1993 Hidroelektra Workers Massacre== References ==== Other sources ==*Novi List (newspaper of Rijeka)", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim bystanders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Killer person <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain captured <extra_id_0> Detainee Talaat Fouad Qasim <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Victim bystanders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle battering <extra_id_0> Artifact buildings <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle destroying <extra_id_0> Artifact vehicles <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker Hassan al-Sharif Mahmud Saad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack firefight  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "US Charges Kyrgyzstan National with Hampering Boston Bombing ProbeBOSTON \u2014\u00a0U.S. officials on Friday charged a Kyrgyzstan national who bought dinner for the accused Boston Marathon bombers the night of the attack with interfering with the investigation into the deadly bombing.Khairullozhon Matanov, a 23-year-old taxi driver who lives in Quincy, Massachusetts, faces one criminal count of destroying records and three counts of lying to officials in a terrorism investigation, according to court papers filed in U.S. District Court in Boston.Brothers Tamerlan Tsarnaev, left, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are accused of carrying out the Boston Marathon bombing. Tamerlan was closely monitored while in Dagestan last year.Prosecutors said Matanov had been friends with accused bombers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, spoke with both in the days after the blast but lied to police about the extent of his relationship with the pair.Matanov, who had hiked a New Hampshire mountain with Tamerlan Tsarnaev to \u201ctrain like, and praise, the 'mujahideen,\u201d' according to court papers, deleted searches related to the attacks from his computer, tried to dispose of cell phones he had used to contact the brothers, and denied knowing much about the pair in interviews with police.Matanov was not accused of playing a role in the April 15, 2013, bombing, which killed three people and injured 264. The Tsarnaev brothers have also been accused of shooting dead a police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology three days after the attack as they tried to flee Boston.Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died after a shootout with police following that incident, while Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was apprehended early the next evening. The surviving brother, now 20, is awaiting trial and faces the possibility of execution if convicted.Matanov told an unidentified witness cooperating with the government that \u201cthe bombings could have had a just reason, such as being done in the name of Islam, that he would support the bombings if the reason were just or the attack had been done by the Taliban, and that the victims had gone to paradise,\u201d according to the papers.Matanov was arrested early Friday by members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force at his home in Quincy. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of destroying evidence and eight years for each false statement count.He is the fourth person to face criminal charges for interfering with the investigation into the largest mass-casualty attack on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.The others are three college friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev: Kazakhstan exchange students Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, as well as Robel Phillipos of Cambridge. Prosecutors contended that after the FBI released photos of the suspected bombers, the three men realized the suspects' identities and removed a laptop and backpack containing empty fireworks shells from Dzhokhar's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant national <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Defendant Tamerlan Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 264 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Defendant brothers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer brothers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Matanov <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges <extra_id_0> Defendant He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "President Nicolas Maduro remembered the fateful day and said that \"like a phoenix,\" the Venezuelan people resurfaced to proudly stand today.As Venezuelans commemorate the 82nd anniversary of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, Aug. 4 also marks a critical day in the country\u2019s recent history. One year ago, in a speech during the 81st anniversary, President Nicolas Maduro was the target of a failed assassination attempt.\"They not only came for me, but they also came for everyone, for the people, and for our country, wanting to undermine the peace and sovereignty of the nation,\" the president said Sunday remembering the frustrated attempt in a speech from the Military Academy in Caracas.\"But God intervened and like the phoenix, we resurfaced from the ashes of a terrorist attack and today a year later I can say that we are standing,\" he added, affirming, once again, the masterminds were the Colombian and United States government.On Aug. 4, 2018, an explosive-loaded drone detonated before reaching a stage where President Maduro was delivering a speech during a military parade in the capital. At that time, the Venezuelan right-wing opposition and its allies, one of which was the U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton, said the explosion was \"a montage.\"\u201cAfter the brief moment of confusion, we knew it was an attack. There were many speculations and lies afterward in the networks but we insisted that it had been an assassination attempt,\u201d Mariela Lopez, a freelance videographer for HispanTV and Xinhua, remembered; as her images, taken in the precise moment of the explosion and the security team's response, were shown around the world.Despite the evidence, global mainstream media ridiculed the drone attack using qualifiers such as \"presumed\", \"supposed\", \"confusing event\" and \"alleged drones\". On Aug. 5, 2018, for instance, CNN Spanish titled an article \"the world reacts to the alleged attack against Nicolas Maduro.\"New videos obtained by CNN provide insight into last year's drone attack against #Venezuela's sitting president Nicolas #Maduro.It may be the world's first known attempt to kill a head of state with a retail drone.@npwcnn reports:https://t.co/A0qJ1Vd3cf \u2014 Michael Rios (@MikeRiosNews) March 14, 2019However, as time went on truth surfaced and on March 2019, CNN revealed unpublished images of how such attack was prepared on a Colombian farm, information which was provided by one of whom were involved in the attempted attack.The report agreed with the government's assertions about the attack.CNN then published an interview with a Venezuelan dissident who organized the attack. He admitted that the objective was to assassinate Maduro, an outcome which involved expecting some \"collateral damages.\"\"[Killing other people] was the risk we had to take,\" the attack organizer said in response to questions and explained that the drones were purchased online and imported to a Colombian farm, where plotters were training day and night in the handling of the devices.The Venezuelan conspirator also assured that U.S. government officials had three meetings with the plotters after the assassination attempt occurred. In those meetings, according to CNN, these officials only \"took notes\" on the background of the plan and its failure.On June 11, Venezuela\u2019s Attorney General, Tarek William Saab, informed that 38 suspects have been indicted in the case of the frustrated assassination attempt and as investigations continue, of the 38 linked so far, 31 are deprived of liberty and seven received substitutive measures.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime assassination <extra_id_0> Victim Nicolas Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime assassination  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime assassinate <extra_id_0> Victim Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Perpetrator He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact delivering <extra_id_0> Communicator Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize knew <extra_id_0> Identifier we <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict indicted <extra_id_0> Defendant suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact speech <extra_id_0> Communicator Nicolas Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact speech <extra_id_0> Communicator the president <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize ridiculed  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize admitted <extra_id_0> Identifier He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Venezuela\u2019s president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has survived an apparent and \u2013 if true \u2013 audacious assassination attempt when, according to official reports, drones loaded with explosives flew towards the president while he was speaking at a military parade in Caracas.But many are now wondering: who could have been behind the attack?Foreign powersAccording to Maduro, the plot was concocted by an international cabal of rightwing schemers. He claimed the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, was \u201cbehind the attack\u201d, supported by a network of plotters and financiers based in Florida, adding that a group of hired assassins had already been captured.Maduro, whose country is in economic and political turmoil, with inflation predicted to reach 1m% this year, has long accused the international community of waging economic war on him. He regularly lambasts the US as \u201cimperialist\u201d and says it is out to destroy socialism while taking over Venezuela\u2019s oil \u2013 of which it has the largest reserves in the world.The opposition within Venezuela is also a regular target. Maduro claims it wants to undo the social reforms brought about by previous president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the charismatic revolutionary who died in 2013. Maduro has jailed and sidelined many opposition activists, regularly accusing them of plotting to overthrow him.It is this conspiracy that Maduro claims will be unearthed in an ongoing investigation.Rightwing rebelsNo one has claimed responsibility for the alleged assassination attempt outright, though one group \u2013 Soldiers Franelas \u2013 suggested involvement in a tweet. \u201cWe have shown [the government] is vulnerable,\u201d the group said. \u201c[The attack] wasn\u2019t achieved today but it is just a matter of time [until it is].\u201d Little is known about Soldiers Franelas beyond their Twitter presence, where the group regularly posts anti-Maduro tweets.La operaci\u00f3n era sobrevolar 2 drones cargados con C4 el objetivo el palco presidencial, francotiradores de la guardia de honor derribaron los drones antes de llegar al objetivo.Demostramos que son vulnerables, no se logr\u00f3 hoy pero es cuesti\u00f3n de tiempo. #MilitaresPatriotas pic.twitter.com/teIEwygN3S \u2014 Soldados de Franelas (@soldadoDfranela) August 4, 2018The episode on Saturday reminded many in Venezuela of a similar incident last year when \u00d3scar P\u00e9rez, a rogue police officer, launched grenades from a stolen helicopter at government buildings in Caracas. P\u00e9rez was killed in a shootout six months later. Some analysts suspect Soldiers Franelas of involvement in that incident.A hoaxSome observers are suspicious of Maduro\u2019s account of events, saying it seems a little too neat in a country where the government has long twisted the truth to its own ends.\u201cThe official \u2018investigation\u2019 of today\u2019s alleged assassination attempt against president Maduro takes the usual course: begin with the conclusions and work backwards,\u201d Phil Gunson, a consultant with non-profit Crisis Group, tweeted on Saturday evening. \u201cIn a country where 98% of crime goes unpunished, government sleuths resolve this kind of case in a matter of hours.\u201dHe will use it to concentrate power, whoever did this David SmildeFirefighters interviewed by the Associated Press claimed that the bangs heard were caused by a gas tank explosion in a nearby apartment. Some local journalists have backed up the claim, posting photos on Twitter of smoke billowing from the Residancias Don Eduardo apartment building on the street where the attack took place.David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America, voiced doubts that the incident was a staged attack. In an interview with AP, he claimed footage of the chaotic scenes at the parade \u2013 which for a short while were broadcast to the nation before being abruptly cut off \u2013 made Maduro look weak. But Smilde said the embattled president will still probably use the attack to cement his power.\u201cHe will use it to concentrate power, whoever did this,\u201d Smilde said. \u201cHe\u2019ll use it to further restrict liberty and purge the government and armed forces.\u201d", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime <extra_id_0> Place country <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flew <extra_id_0> Vehicle drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact speaking <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator the president <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain jailed <extra_id_0> Jailer Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee opposition activists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack launched <extra_id_0> Instrument grenades <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target government buildings <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker \u00d3scar P\u00e9rez <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim P\u00e9rez <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shootout  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact interviewed <extra_id_0> Participant Firefighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place Residancias Don Eduardo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place apartment <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

His lawyers said he intended to challenge the Abe administration\u2019s policy on nuclear energy, and that as a form of protest the move did not break any laws.Prosecutors had demanded a three-year prison term for Yamamoto as well as the confiscation of his drone. They said his actions were premeditated and clearly intended to interfere with official duties.An expressionless Yamamoto, who appeared at the court in a gray sweatshirt and sweatpants, sat with his head down as the sentence was read out.The incident ignited a heated discussion about the need for regulations for drones.In September, the government revised the Aviation Law to set the first restrictions on how to operate drones.The law, which has been in effect since December, bans drones from areas near airports and above densely populated areas, including all 23 wards in central Tokyo, unless granted government permission.

{"text": "THE TWIN TOWERS; Deadly Bomb Was Cheap and Easily Made, Experts SayThe bomb that savaged the World Trade Center, investigators and explosive experts said yesterday, apparently was put together with ordinary chemicals that are widely and cheaply available at chemical supply houses and gardening centers throughout the country.Experts now estimate that the bomb weighed about 1,000 pounds and that the chemicals to make it were bought for a little more than $400.Though a young chemical engineer was arrested yesterday in connection with the explosion, the experts say that such a bomb could have been made by almost anyone with the help of one of scores of manuals, obtainable in bookstores and libraries, that provide step-by-step instructions.\"It's very easy to make one of these things,\" said Edward M.Roy, an explosives expert at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, N.M. \"I tell my students, a lot of explosives I can make in my wastebasket.\"A Jumble of ChemicalsFollowing the trail of Mohammed A. Salameh, the \ufb01rst suspect arrested in the bombing, investigators discovered a jumble of chemicals, chemistry implements and detonating materials stacked in a storage locker at 69 Mallory Avenue in Jersey City that they say may also have served as the bomb laboratory.The day before the explosion that killed at least \ufb01ve people and injured more than 1,000 others, Mr.Salameh and several other men made \"numerous trips\" to the locker, which Mr.Salameh had rented for $97 a month late last year, the authorities say.The suspects traveled in a yellow Ford van, the investigators say, which has been identi\ufb01ed as the vehicle that carried the explosive into the underground garage of the World Trade Center.A Thick PasteThe investigators and experts say that after mixing the three main chemicals -- nitric and sulfuric acids and urea, a common ingredient in fertilizers -- into a thick paste, the bombers are believed to have packed the material into half a dozen or so cardboard boxes.They simply loaded the boxes loosely into the van, without using a special container for them, the investigators believe, and drove across the Hudson River to the trade center.The bombers ignited their concoction, investigators believe, with several smaller nitroglycerine bombs, which themselves were touched off with the kind of blasting cap routinely used at construction and mining sites across the country.The blasting cap is the only ingredient in the deadly mix, the experts and law-enforcement of\ufb01cials say, that requires a license or permit for purchase, and most probably was stolen.Manuals Were FoundThe investigators said they found manuals for bomb making in one of the apartments that they raided after arresting Mr.Salameh.Neil C.Livingstone, the president of the Institute on Terrorism and Sub-National Con\ufb02ict in Washington, said that as a test of how easy it was to obtain such guides to destruction, he recently wrote to a publishing house using a child's lined notepad and a crayon.Three of the bomb-making manuals were promptly delivered to the address Mr. Livingstone had given, he said, no questions asked.Though building the bomb was relatively easy, the experts say, it was not by any means free of danger.The bulkiest part of the bomb, they say, was extremely stable and could only have been touched off with a tremendous kick, like that provided by nitroglycerine.Making the nitroglycerine, by blending some of the chemicals, was the trickiest part of the process.As the chemicals are mixed to form this compound, said Dr. Per-Anders Persson, the director of the center for explosives research at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, they get hot and may explode.Often, he said, beakers are packed in dry ice to keep the chemicals at a safe temperature.A Dangerous MixThe nitroglycerine could have also exploded prematurely with any jolt or sharp change in temperature, the experts said.The bombers risked blowing themselves up as well, the experts said, when they hooked up the wires connecting the bomb's trigger with the blasting cap.Dr.Robert H. Kupperman, a senior adviser for science and technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University, said that perhaps the greatest skill in making the bomb came in rigging the chain of triggering explosives so they all tore into the bulk of the bomb for maximum effect, as investigators at the World Trade Center say apparently happened.So far, in more than a week of searching, they have not found a single grain of the main explosive material.Sulfuric Acid Widely SoldWilliam Lazor, a senior technical consultant at the Du Pont Company in Wilmington, Del., said that sulfuric acid is the most widely sold chemical in the United States, used in the manufacture of everything from battery acid to detergents and shampoos.Dale Ladysh, another consultant at Du Pont, said that nitric acid is only slightly behind in popularity.It is used, he said, in the electronics industry and for making stainless steel and many industrial dies and pigmentations.Both acids are commonly used metal cleaners.According to Rick Amberg of Amberg Perennial Farm and Garden Center in West\ufb01eld, N.J., urea is often scattered over lawns to make them grow lustrously, and is also used in making plastics.Mr. Amberg sells a plastic 50-pound bag of urea for $20.99.In Newark, the Dooner & Smith Chemical Company sells a 15-gallon drum of sulfuric acid, weighing 172 pounds, for $41.28.The same size container of nitric acid costs $44 and weighs 220 pounds.\"Whoever put that thing together really intended to do a lot of damage,\" said Mr.Roy.\"This kind of explosive device is often used to fracture and move rock.It expands slowly with great force.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack savaged <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target World Trade Center <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble put together <extra_id_0> Components chemicals <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell bought <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity chemicals <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PaymentBarter $400 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee engineer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble make  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble make <extra_id_0> Artifact explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Mohammed A.

But in the wake of the peace deal, the Cuban-inspired insurgency has been gaining strength, especially along the eastern border with Venezuela, where it has carried out a number of kidnappings and bombings of oil pipelines. That has hardened Duque\u2019s resolve in refusing to resume peace talks that have been stalled since he took office last August.Thursday\u2019s bombing was the deadliest in the capital since an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary\u2019s Movement for the bombing.But it has been more than a decade since a police or military installation in the capital has suffered a major bombing. A blast at military university in 2006 left almost two dozen people injured.Ariel \u00c1vila, an analyst who tracks violence, said that in the last four years, there have been 28 attacks in the capital with explosives.

That was certainly the case here on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 17, 2011.I shudder to think how different things would have been for us were it not for three temporary workers who were pulling a shift for the city\u2019s Public Utilities District: Mark Steiner, Brandon Klaus and Sherman Welpton.Ring a bell? Didn\u2019t with me, either.I\u2019m embarrassed to say that I had to do a computer search to get the names of the trio that arguably saved Spokane from a Boston-like carnage.The men noticed the backpack. It had been placed along the route soon to be filled with marchers honoring the late civil rights leader. They could have just as easily ignored it, but they didn\u2019t. They opened the package, saw wires and called authorities.Eric Olsen and Jason Hartman, two police sergeants, smoothly ordered the march diverted.It took some time, but the clues led investigators to the cancer behind this mad act: Kevin W. Harpham, a 36-year-old self-avowed white supremacist from rural Addy, Wash.Racist.

Laced with rat poison, the weapon was designed to be detonated from as far as 1,000 feet away. Dozens could have died or been mutilated horribly.Harpham was sentenced to 32 years in prison, the maximum allowed under a plea bargain struck between Harpham\u2019s attorneys and prosecutors.That still doesn\u2019t seem like enough.It\u2019s easy to take for granted the things that don\u2019t happen, but watching the horrors unfold in Boston should drive home just how lucky we were.Limbs blown off. Lives lost. In an eye blink, one of the nation\u2019s most revered athletic events had turned into a bloody war zone.Then things got even more surreal.Carjacking. Kidnapping. A police officer killed. Citizens told to stay in their homes.Before last Monday, would anyone have imagined that two angry young men could paralyze a city such as Boston?And who would imagine that Spokane would be spared by the grace of God and a few contract workers?It\u2019s true.

{"text": "There have been many terrible events in the history of Northern Ireland's conflict, but few have seared the collective consciousness of its people as those on Friday, 21 July 1972, a day that became known as Bloody Friday.By the end of the day, the IRA's Belfast brigade had detonated at least 20 bombs across the city.In just 75 minutes of violence, nine people were dead and some 130 more were mutilated, injured and mentally scarred by what they had witnessed.You could hear people screaming, crying and moaning. The first thing that caught my eye was a torso of a human being in the middle of the streetPolice officer at the sceneFrom the outset, the IRA's bombing of the city caused widespread chaos and stretched the security forces to the limit.Such was the scale of the attack, witnesses at the time remember seeing people running in all directions, not knowing where the bombs were being detonated.As one report at the time described the scene, \"it was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe\".Car bombsWhile the scale of the attack was huge, it was two car bombs that between them claimed the nine lives - one at the Oxford Street bus station in the city centre, the other outside shops in Cavehill Road in north Belfast.At Oxford St, the busiest bus station in Northern Ireland, four Ulsterbus workers and two soldiers were killed.When the emergency services reached the scene, they found that some of the victims had been literally blown to pieces, leading to initial estimates of a death toll of 11.At the Cavehill Road bomb, the victims were two women and a 14-year-old schoolboy.Of the 130 injured, 77 were women or children out shopping in the city centre. One police officer at the scene recalled the events for the BBC series Provos in 1997.\"You could hear people screaming, crying and moaning. The first thing that caught my eye was a torso of a human being lying in the middle of the street,\" he told the series.Collapsed ceasefireIn terms of furthering its cause among nationalists, the IRA's decision to carry out the Bloody Friday attacks proved to be a disaster.Earlier in the year, the IRA had experienced a massive propaganda and recruitment boost after the Parachute Regiment killed 13 protesters during Bloody Sunday in Derry. Many joined believing that they had no other way to defend their communities.It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time.Former IRA leader Sean MacStiofainBy June, the organisation felt confident enough to call a ceasefire and hold secret talks with British ministers in London. Those talks came to nothing and the ceasefire collapsed.Bloody Friday was part of a deliberate decision to ratchet up a campaign and make normal life impossible.But after causing the deaths, the IRA tried to blame the security forces for failing to act on warnings.Ultimately Bloody Friday revealed a side to the organisation that many who had joined in the wake of Bloody Sunday had not wished to acknowledge.Within 10 days of the attacks, the army moved in to the Bogside area of Derry to take control of a part of the city that had become out-of-bounds, marking the beginning of a long war of attrition by both sides.DenialsIn later years, an IRA leader at the time, Sean MacStiofain, said that the aim of the Bloody Friday attacks had been to cause financial damage - but he still refused to accept responsibility.\"It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time,\" he said.\"Republicans were convinced that the British had deliberately disregarded these two warnings for strategic policy reasons.\"Bloody Friday was by no means the last atrocity of 1972.

{"text": "Boston Bombing Suspect was on CIA, FBI Watch ListU.S. officials say the oldest of the two brothers suspected in the Boston Marathon bombings was placed on a counterterrorism list in late 2011.The officials say the CIA asked that Tamerlan Tsarnaev's name be placed on the list after it was contacted by the Russian government with its concerns that he had become a radical Islamist. Moscow also issued a similar warning to the FBI on Tamerlan Tsarnaev earlier in 2011. Officials say the agency launched an investigation, but eventually concluded he posed no threat.Information sharing U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns about information sharing between law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the aftermath of the April 15 twin bombings that left three people dead and 264 others injured - including at least 14 who lost limbs. Authorities will brief the full U.S. Senate on the investigation into the bombing.Investigators say Tamerlan, 26, and his brother Dzhokar, 19, placed the bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police last Thursday, while Dzhokhar was captured a day later.Dzhokhar has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction. He is in federal custody in a Boston hospital.Russia visit Several months after he first came to the attention of U.S. federal agents, Tamerlan Tsarnaev left the U.S. in January 2012 for a six-month visit to Russia. When he returned, his name generated an alert by a screening system used by U.S. Customs agents. But Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said the FBI told him it was not aware at the time of Tsarnaev's trip to Russia.U.S. investigators have questioned the suspects' parents in the Russian republic of Dagestan to determine if Tamerlan had contacts with Islamic extremists during his 2012 visit. The family is originally from Chechnya, where Muslim insurgents have been engaged in a bloody conflict with Russia for decades. Memorial service U.S. Vice President Joe Biden denounced the suspects Wednesday in Boston. Biden spoke at a memorial service for a university police officer allegedly gunned down by the suspects just days after the bombings. \"Why, whether it\u2019s al-Qaida central ... or two twisted, perverted, cowardly, knock-off jihadists here in Boston. Why do they do what they do?\u201d he asked.Several thousand mourners gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to remember the slain policeman, Sean Collier.

{"text": "The King's Cross station and Euston station bombings were two bombing attacks on 10 September 1973 by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) that targeted two mainline railway stations in central London. The blasts wounded 13 civilians, some of whom were seriously injured, and also caused large-scale but superficial damage. This was a second wave of bombing attacks launched by the IRA in England in 1973 after the Old Bailey car bombing earlier in the year which had killed one  and injured around 200 civilians.==Background==In 1971, during The Troubles, after two years engaged in violence based on a defensive strategy in Irish communal districts of Northern Ireland, the Provisional IRA launched an offensive against the United Kingdom. At a meeting of the IRA Army Council in June 1972 the organization's Chief of Staff, Se\u00e1n Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in, first proposed making bombing attacks in England. The Army Council did not at first agree to the suggestion, but in early 1973 after its negotiations with the British Government for a truce the previous year had failed to advance the political objective of the removal of Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom by the application of the threat of violence, it re-engaged its paramilitary campaign and sanctioned Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in's proposal. Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in had put the strategy forward on the basis that extending the urban paramilitary violence of the Northern Ireland state into England would help to relieve pressure being exerted by the British Army on the IRA's strongholds of Irish communal support in districts in the province, such as West Belfast and Derry, by diverting British security strength from them back into England, whilst at the same time increasing strategic pressure upon the British Government to resolve the conflict by political concessions to the IRA's demands. He also believed that a successful bombing campaign in London, as the capital city of the United Kingdom, would offer substantial propaganda value for paramilitary Irish Republicanism, and provide a morale boost to its supporters.The effects of the previous 1973 Old Bailey bombing appeared to give some credence to the idea of the propaganda value of extending violence into London as, although it would have been considered almost routine in Northern Ireland by the mid-1970s and have drawn only brief media notice, being carried out instead in London, a global capital city, had made the event world news headlines. However, although the bombing of the Old Bailey had been successfully carried out, and had gained media attention, increasing political pressure upon the British Government to address the issue of the conflict in Northern Ireland with more urgency, it had been costly to the IRA, as 10 out of the 11 man Active Service Unit that had carried it out had been arrested by the British police whilst trying to leave England before the bombs they had planted detonated. Drawing the tactical lesson that large teams were a security liability, for the second wave of bombings in England later in 1973, instead of sending a large team to carry it out with orders to withdraw back to Ireland immediately afterwards, smaller detached \"cell\" units of about 3-4 personnel were sent to carry out the operation, with instructions to remain in England afterwards and wage a campaign of bombings around England upon a variety of targets.There were bombings on 8 September 1973, including one at Victoria railway station which injured four civilians.==Bombings==On 10 September 1973 a bomb (with no warning issued beforehand) exploded at King's Cross railway station in the booking hall at 12.24 p.m. when a youth of around 16/17 years of age walked up to the entrance of the station's old booking hall and threw a bag into it which contained a 3\u00a0lb (1.4\u00a0kg) device, which detonated, shattering glass throughout the hall and throwing a baggage trolley several feet into the air. The youth then fled into the station's crowd and escaped the scene.Approximately 45 minutes after the attack at King's Cross, after a telephone called warning 5 minutes beforehand by a man with an Irish accent to the Press Association, a second bomb detonated in a snack bar at Euston railway station, injuring another eight civilians. One witness at Euston said: \"I saw a flash and suddenly people were being thrown through the air - it was a terrible mess, they were bleeding and screaming\" A total of 13 civilians were injured in the two attacks. The Metropolitan Police issued a photofit picture of a 5\u00a0ft 2 tall 16/17-year-old youth they were seeking in regard to the King's Cross attack.==Subsequent events==On 12 September 1973 two more bombs exploded, one in Oxford Street and another in Sloane Square, targeting retail shopping centres. Police subsequently announced that they were looking for five people in connection with this second wave of bomb attacks in England.Judith Ward was later wrongly convicted for having been involved in the late 1973 London bombings, along with the M62 coach bombing. She was later acquitted. No one else was brought to trial for this IRA bombing campaign.==See also==*Bombings of Paddington and Victoria stations *Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1970\u201379)==Sources==* CAIN project * BBC ON THIS DAY  Bomb blasts rock central London ==References==", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target Euston station <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place England <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target Old Bailey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Place England <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Se\u00e1n Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target Old Bailey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target Old Bailey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Attacker England <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Target Victoria railway station <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target hall <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack threw <extra_id_0> Attacker youth <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure bleeding <extra_id_0> Victim they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target King's Cross <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Sloane Square <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target centres <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place England <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant Judith Ward <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Place London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target M62 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack Bombings <extra_id_0> Target stations <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice Bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

While it was not our intention to injure or kill non-combatants, the reality is that on this and on a number of other occasions, that was the consequence of our actions. It is therefore appropriate on the anniversary of this tragic event, that we address all of the deaths and injuries of non-combatants caused by us. We offer our sincere apologies and condolences to their families. There have been fatalities amongst combatants on all sides. We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives. The future will not be found in denying collective failures and mistakes or closing minds and hearts to the plight of those who have been hurt. That includes all of the victims of the conflict, combatants and non-combatants. It will not be achieved by creating a hierarchy of victims in which some are deemed more or less worthy than others. The process of conflict resolution requires the equal acknowledgement of the grief and loss of others. On this anniversary, we are endeavouring to fulfil this responsibility to those we have hurt. The IRA is committed unequivocally to the search for freedom, justice and peace in Ireland. We remain totally committed to the peace process and to dealing with the challenges and difficulties which this presents.

{"text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The plaza where the attack took place was cordoned off as paramedics helped the injuredA homemade bomb has exploded at a restaurant in Mississauga, Canada's sixth largest city, injuring 15 people.Police said two suspects entered the Bombay Bhel restaurant in the Ontario city late on Thursday and detonated the improvised bomb.Ambulance services said that three of the 15 people taken to hospital had \"critical blast injuries\".Two male suspects fled the scene immediately after the explosion in the city, which is near Toronto.Peel Regional Police said they had received a call about the incident at 22:32 local time (02:32 GMT).Police issued CCTV footage of the two suspects, describing them both as men around 5ft 10 in height with light or fair skin, and appealing for help identifying them.One man was described as \"stocky\" and in his mid-20s, while the other was of thin build. Both wore blue jeans and dark hoodies, and had covered their faces.The motive for the attack is unknown.Sergeant Matt Bertram told the Associated Press the two men just \"dropped off this device, and took off right away\".\"We have no indication to call it a hate crime or any kind of terrorism act,\" he added.Canadian broadcaster CBC reported a heavy police presence, complete with \"tactical teams\" - and said an officer on the scene could not say whether there was a further threat to public safety.One eyewitness speaking to CBC said he was at a different restaurant nearby when the explosion happened. He suggested that a birthday party, possibly involving children, was taking place inside Bombay Bhel at the time of the blast.Meanwhile, Indian foreign minister Sushma Swaraj said she was in touch with the country's representatives in Canada following the attack on an Indian restaurant, promising \"our missions will work round the clock\".Mississauga, a large city on the shore of Lake Ontario, borders the larger city of Toronto and is home to Toronto Pearson International Airport.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Transportation cordoned <extra_id_0> Destination plaza <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Intervention helped <extra_id_0> Treater paramedics <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Patient injured <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target restaurant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Mississauga <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> Attacker suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target restaurant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Ontario <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place restaurant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place where <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

It was just completely flattened,\" she said.\"People just came from everywhere. They were on their hands and knees. They were passing the rubble one by one. They were in a big line.\"You heard them shouting: 'There's one, there's one'.\"It was just total chaos. Soldiers threw their guns down on the ground to help the people from the New Lodge Road dig.\"Later, she went home and found her grandmother in the house crying, after learning that Pat's mother and father had been caught up in the bomb.Her father was seriously injured in the blast.\"After that was like a total blur, because people were coming in and out of the house,\" she said.\"There were that many different stories being told.\"My granny gave me and my brother wee jobs to do about the house.

'It's all right Johnny,' she said. 'It's all right'.\"This seemed to go on every night, where he cried and he relived the whole explosion. It was a very sad time.\"Some reports at the time suggested the bar was frequented by political activists, that the bomb belonged to an IRA team in transit and was a republican 'own-goal'.But this was rubbished as \"ridiculous\" by local residents.Pat said: \"You were saying to yourself: 'Who killed my mummy? Why did my own people kill my mummy?\"At the back of your mind you knew it wasn't our own people that had done it.\"This was a family-run bar and it was people like my mummy and daddy that went to talk with each other and just pass the time of day for a pint or an orange and then come home again.\"Seven years after the bomb, a UVF man received 15 life sentences after he was convicted of the bombing.On Tuesday night a number of events are being held to mark the 30th anniverary of the atrocity.1900 GMT Mass at St Patrick's Chapel, Donegall Street.

{"text": "How Many US Troops Were Killed By Iranian IEDs in Iraq?Far fewer than Congress thinks, according to newly declassified documents from U.S. Central Command.Explosively formed penetrators \u2014 a particularly deadly form of roadside bomb \u2014 killed 196 American soldiers in Iraq over a five-and-a-half-year period, according to recently declassified Pentagon documents.That\u2019s about half as many deaths as lawmakers have attributed to the bombs, which U.S. officials say were largely supplied by Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force.The carnage wrought by EFPs returned to the news over the summer, as opponents of the nuclear deal with Iran cited Tehran\u2019s behind-the-scenes actions against U.S. troops during Operation Iraqi Freedom as a reason to scuttle the agreement.Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who is also running for president, and others in Congress have said that EFPs had killed more than 500 troops.\u201cI understand that the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency has a classified list of roughly 500 American soldiers who were murdered by Iranian IEDs,\u201d Cruz said at a July 29 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.But data from U.S. Central Command, which runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East, suggests the actual toll is far less.According to the first comprehensive accounting, between November 2005 and December 2011, 1,526 EFPs killed a total of 196 U.S. troops and injured 861.Between October 2006 and September 2007, EFPs killed 97 U.S. troops and wounded more than 300 soldiers.EFP attacks peaked in March, April and May 2008, near the end of the American troop surge, when 200 of the bombs were detonated.The deadliest month was April 2008, when EFPs killed 15 U.S. soldiers.The Pentagon attributes the presence of EFPs in Iraq to the Quds Force, the special forces arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard led by Qasem Soleimani.Various EFP \u201cfactories\u201d were found throughout Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.Still, the exact degree to which Iran bears culpability for arming Shia militias in Iraq with EFPs and related equipment is a matter of some dispute.\u201cWe weren\u2019t always able to attribute the casualties that we had to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we didn't necessarily have the forensics to support that,\u201d Gen. Joseph Dunford, the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at his July 9 confirmation hearing.During the hearing, Dunford said the numbers of American soldiers killed by Iran \u201chas been recently quoted as about 500.\u201dCENTCOM later clarified that Dunford was referring to total American deaths by EFPs and other Iranian weapons.It is \u201cimportant to understand that the CENTCOM statistics on EFP detonations are a subset of all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during OIF,\u201d Maj. Genieve David, a CENTCOM spokeswoman, said in an email.Data about the roughly 300 deaths not caused by EFPs, including the kind of weapons used in the attacks, is classified, David said.A few weeks later, at the July 29 hearing, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the outgoing Joint Chiefs chairman, said \u201cseveral hundred\u201d American forces were killed by EFPs.Phil Novack, a spokesman for Cruz, told Defense One that the Senator's office is working with the Pentagon to get specific numbers.He said Cruz used the 500 number based on Dunford's testimony.Cruz \u201casked Secretary Carter to inform the families of the 500 service members who were killed by Iranian EFPs that their loved ones were murdered by the same man who will now receive sanctions relief,\u201d Novack said in an email.\u201cWhether the number is 500 lives or 196 is immaterial; the fact remains that General Soleimani \u2014 a man responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American service members \u2014 will receive sanctions relief to the tune of millions of dollars if this deal is approved.\"The arrival of EFPs on the Iraqi battlefield around 2005 came as a shock to U.S. planners.Along with more run-of-the-mill improvised explosive devices, the deadly bombs drove a crash effort to create and deploy vehicles with far better armor.Whereas most roadside bombs send energy and shrapnel in all directions, EFPs work more like cannons.The force of the blast molds a concave metal disc, called a liner, into a \u201cformed penetrator\u201d which is propelled at up to 3,000 meters per second.The effect is incredibly destructive, even to up-armored Humvees.\u201cYou can do as much or more damage with a 5-pound EFP, which is aimed, as with a 200-pound conventional IED,\u201d a Pentagon analyst told Los Angeles Times writer Andrew Cockburn in 2007.The analyst speculated that the cost to construct such a device was about $30 or less.They\u2019ve been around since at least World War II, when resistance elements in Europe used them against Germans, Cockburn wrote.Among the other Iranian arms introduced to the Iraqi battlefield is the improvised rocket assisted munition, described in one Joint IED Defeat Organization document as \u201ca rocket-fired improvised explosive device made from a large metal canister \u2014 such as a propane gas tank \u2014 filled with explosives, scrap metal and ball bearings and propelled by rockets.\u201dFirst seen in Iraq in 2007, the IRAM \u2014 \u201cessentially an airborne version of a roadside bomb \u2014 a flying IED\u201d is \u201dthe signature weapon used by Iranian-backed militias that operate with the aid of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Group,\u201d the undated document says.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die Killed <extra_id_0> Victim Troops

{"text": "Boston Bomber Sentenced to DeathConvicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been sentenced to death over the April 2013 attack that killed three people and wounded 264 others.A Boston jury, consisting of seven men and five women, reached the decision Friday in the penalty phase of the trial after deliberating for more than 14 hours over three days. The jury unanimously determined that, based on the \"aggravating and mitigating circumstances,\" Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death.Karen Snyder, right, and Kathryn Vanwie react to the announcement of the death penalty verdict for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev outside the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in Boston, May 15, 2015.Unanimous decisionThe jury had to reach a unanimous decision for Tsarnaev to receive the death penatly. Otherwise, he would have spent the rest of his life in prison without parole.VOA's Fatima Tlisova reported from the courtroom that some of the jurors were crying as Tsarnaev sat with his head down.In a statement following the verdict, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch accused Tsarnaev of \"coldly and callously\" perpetrating a terrorist attack. She said no verdict can \"heal the souls of those who lost loved ones, nor the minds and bodies of those who suffered life-changing injuries.\"But she said the death penalty is a \"fitting punishment for this horrific crime\" and said she hoped the case's completion brings closure to the victims and their families.U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, who prosecuted the case, said at a news conference that the verdict was \"fair and just.\" She said Tsarnaev believed in an ideology of hate and expressed that ideology by killing and maiming Americans, noting that he will \"pay with his life.\"Vincent Lisi, the FBI special agent in charge of the case, said the bombing victims motivated and inspired the investigators every day.Tsarnaev, 21, was found guilty last month of all 30 terrorism and other charges. Of those, 17 carried the possibility of the death penalty.Jurors' deliberationsJurors were required to fill out a lengthy, complicated verdict form that asked them to make findings on 12 aggravating factors prosecutors said support a death sentence and 21 mitigating factors Tsarnaev's lawyers said instead support a sentence of life in prison.The jurors then had to weigh any mitigating factors against any aggravating ones to determine Tsarnaev's sentence.During the penalty phase of the judicial proceedings, prosecutors brushed off defense arguments that Tsarnaev was under the strong influence of his older, radicalized brother, Tamerlan, who was killed in a police shootout.They said even though he was only 19 at the time of the marathon bombing, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was old enough to know right from wrong, and he wanted to avenge U.S. wars in Iran and Afghanistan.The Boston Marathon bombing was one of the bloodiest terrorist attacks in the United States since September 11, 2001.Two pressure-cooker bombs packed with shrapnel exploded near the marathon finish line on April 15, 2013.

MUST WATCH Mailbox might have saved this man's life 03:13-- One was housed in a pressure cooker hidden inside a backpack, the FBI said.The device also had fragments that may have included nails, BBs and ball bearings, the agency said.-- The second bomb was in a metal container, but it was unclear whether it was in a pressure cooker as well, the FBI said.-- Photos obtained by CNN show the remains of a pressure cooker found at the scene, along with a shredded black backpack and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings.-- They were sent to the FBI's national laboratory in Virginia, where technicians will try to reconstruct the devices.-- In the past, the U.S. government has warned federal agencies that terrorists could turn pressure cookers into bombs by packing them with explosives and shrapnel, and detonating them with blasting caps.-- Authorities sifted through thousands of pieces of evidence and a mass of digital photos and video clips.They have pleaded for the public's help in providing additional leads and images.The casualtiesThe blasts left three people dead.-- Martin Richard , an 8-year-old boy with a gap-tooth grin and bright eyes.He loved to run and play in his yard.-- Krystle Campbell , a 29-year-old freckle-faced woman described as having \"a heart of gold.\"-- The third victim was Lingzu Lu , a graduate student at Boston University, who had moved to the city last fall, making friends and soaking up new experiences.-- Of the approximately 178 people injured, 66 remain in area hospitals, according to the latest CNN tally.Thirteen of those are still in critical condition, hospital officials said.- Martin's mother and sister are among the wounded.His mother underwent surgery for a brain injury, and his 6-year-old sister lost her leg.The injuries-- Doctors say dozens of victims suffered injuries to their legs that involve blood vessels, bone and tissue.-- The bombings resulted in at least 13 amputations and left doctors picking ball bearings out of victims in the emergency room, a terrorism expert briefed on the investigation said.-- Dr. George Velmahos, head of trauma care at Massachusetts General Hospital, said his team found \"numerous\" metal pellets and nails inside patients' bodies.\"There are people who have 10, 20, 30, 40 of them in their body, or more,\" Velmahos said.-- Dr. Ron Walls also said one patient had more than 12 carpenter-type nails.\"There is no question some of these objects were implanted in the device for the purpose of being exploded forward,\" he said.Terror group links-- While the clues moved the investigation forward, it is still unclear whether the attack was an act of domestic or foreign terrorism.-- No connection has been made to any terrorist group or individual.-- President Barack Obama described the bombings as an act of terrorism, but said it is unclear whether they were the work of a group or \"a malevolent individual.\"-- The Pakistani Taliban has said it was not involved in the attack.-- Authorities don't have a sense of what the motive is, an official said.-- The FBI asked the public to report anyone who talked about targeting the marathon or showed interest in explosives.The agency urged anyone who might have heard explosions in remote areas -- possibly by someone testing a bomb -- or seen someone carrying \"an unusually heavy, dark-colored bag\" around the time of the attack to come forward.'Possible' suspectsThree days later, authorities have yet to make an arrest, but have made \"significant progress,\" a law enforcement official said.-- Investigators have pinpointed two men of \"high interest\" as possible suspects after they appeared in images near the finish line moments before the blasts, a law enforcement official said.-- One of the men is seen carrying a black backpack.-- Authorities had not yet named the two, but their photographs have been distributed to law enforcement, a source said.-- Earlier Wednesday, two sources with knowledge of the investigation identified a man as a possible suspect in the attack, but did not name him.-- Seen on a video, the man wore a white baseball cap.One of the sources added that the cap was on backwards and the man was also wearing a light-colored hooded sweatshirt and a black jacket.-- It was not immediately clear if he is one of those alluded to in the photographs distributed to law enforcement officials.-- Investigators are closer to cracking the case \"every hour,\" Massachusetts Gov.Deval Patrick said.He urged patience with the probe to allow investigators space to do their job.-- \"I wish they had nailed the perpetrator within minutes of this catastrophe, but I understand from experience it's going to take some time,\" he said.The Investigation-- Significant progress has been made in the investigation, but there has been no arrest, the FBI told CNN.-- After sources told CNN on Wednesday that an arrest had been made, sources with the Department of Justice and Boston Police Department each said that no arrest had been made.-- A source with Boston law enforcement said, \"We got him,\" but would not clarify whether that meant an identification had been made or an arrest carried out.-- Some federal sources said that it would be going too far to say even that an identification had been made, but several sources in Boston disputed that, saying a clear identification had been made.-- Investigators believe they have identified a suspect in the marathon bombings, a source who has been briefed on the investigation told CNN's John King.The possible breakthrough came from an analysis of video from a Lord and Taylor department store near the site of the second blast, and video from a Boston TV station helped as well, the official said.-- As they scramble to search for suspects, authorities are processing \"the most complex crime scene that we have dealt with in the history of our department,\" said Ed Davis, the Boston police commissioner.-- Forensic specialists and dogs trained to detect explosive devices and their residue were at the scene of the blasts.A command post has been created, with 1,000 officers conducting interviews and gathering details.-- Authorities have received 2,000 tips from around the world, said Richard DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office.\"Someone knows who did this,\" he said.Security elsewhere-- Cities have stepped up security after the attacks, including Washington, New York, Miami, Chicago, Atlanta and Los Angeles.-- British police said they are reviewing the security plan for the London Marathon scheduled for Sunday.The marathon will observe 30 seconds of silence and is urging runners to wear a black ribbon to mark the Boston tragedy.Reaction-- \"Boston is not going to be intimidated by this,\" said Secretary of State John Kerry, a former U.S. senator from Massachusetts.\"But we are going to find out who did this.The police work being done is extraordinary.The FBI is remarkable.There is a great deal of forensic evidence.We are hopeful we can bring people to justice.\"\"The Islamic Republic condemns killing of innocent people in U.S. Boston, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria in equal measure,\" Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Wednesday, according to a report on state-run Press TV.Tributes-- Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will travel to Boston on Thursday for an 11 a.m. interfaith service dedicated to the victims.The president is expected to meet with the families of those wounded or killed.--Obama declared an emergency in Massachusetts and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1>

{"text": "Blast also injured more than 50 people, but authorities have yet to suggest who was behind the attackThis article is more than 1 year oldThis article is more than 1 year oldTwenty-one people have been killed and dozens more injured in a car bombing at a Colombian police academy in Bogot\u00e1, recalling the high-profile attacks associated with the bloodiest chapters of the country\u2019s guerrilla and drug conflicts.The scene outside the General Santander police academy was chaotic after the mid-morning explosion on Thursday, with ambulances and helicopters rushing to the normally tightly controlled facility.Witnesses said they heard a loud explosion that destroyed windows in adjacent buildings. Pictures on social media showed a charred vehicle surrounded by debris on the academy\u2019s campus.Among the dead were a Panamanian and an Ecuadorian national.Alcald\u00eda de Bogot\u00e1 (@Bogota) #Atenci\u00f3n El alcalde @EnriquePenalosa se encuentra en la Escuela General Santander acompa\u00f1ando a la @PoliciaColombia.En breve entregaremos m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n.#Bogot\u00e1CondenaElTerrorismo pic.twitter.com/HBekT48yYiRafael Trujillo said he was delivering a care package to his son Gerson, who entered the school two days ago, when he was stopped in his tracks by the blast a block away from the school\u2019s heavily fortified entrance.\u201cI\u2019m sad and very worried because I don\u2019t have any information about my son,\u201d said Trujillo, standing outside the facility, where police officers had set up a taped perimeter. \u201cThis reminds me of some very sad days in the past.\u201dPresident Iv\u00e1n Duque, who was visiting a western state, was rushing back to the capital to oversee the police investigation into what he called a \u201cmiserable\u201d attack.\u201cAll of us Colombians reject terrorism and are united in confronting it,\u201d Duque said in a tweet. \u201cWe won\u2019t bend in the face of violence.\u201dInvestigators had identified the car\u2019s driver as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, who was among the dead, said the Colombian attorney general, N\u00e9stor Humberto Mart\u00ednez.He said the vehicle, a gray Nissan Patrol SUV, was carrying 80kg (176lb) of the high explosive pentolite, which has been used in the past by Colombian guerrillas.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack and Mart\u00ednez said investigators were searching for its \u201cintellectual authors\u201d.For decades, residents of Bogot\u00e1 lived in fear of being caught in a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar\u2019s Medell\u00edn drug cartel. But as Colombia\u2019s conflict has wound down, and the nation\u2019s largest rebel group disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Smouldering remains of car bomb are seen in this screengrab outside Bogot\u00e1 police academy.Authorities have yet to suggest who was behind the attack, but attention has focused on leftist rebels from the National Liberation Army, ELN, which has been stepping up attacks on police targets in Colombia amid a standoff with the conservative Duque over how to restart stalled peace talks.Colombian rebels blamed for killing spree 400 miles inside Venezuela Read moreThe group known was long considered a lesser military threat than the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), whose 7,000 guerrilla fighters disarmed as part of a 2016 peace accord. But in the wake of the peace deal, the Cuban-inspired insurgency has been gaining strength, especially along the eastern border with Venezuela, where it has carried out a number of kidnappings and bombings of oil pipelines. That has hardened Duque\u2019s resolve in refusing to resume peace talks that have been stalled since he took office last August.Thursday\u2019s bombing was the deadliest in the capital since an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary\u2019s Movement for the bombing.But it has been more than a decade since a police or military installation in the capital has suffered a major bombing. A blast at a military university in 2006 left almost two dozen people injured.Ariel \u00c1vila, an analyst who tracks violence, said that in the last four years, there have been 28 attacks in the capital with explosives. While the majority has been carried out with low-grade homemade materials and grenades that have damaged property but left no casualties, he said police intelligence and checkpoints surrounding the city need to be reinforced to prevent more attacks.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack Blast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim more <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place academy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place academy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation rushing <extra_id_0> Vehicle ambulances <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination facility <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place buildings <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle destroyed <extra_id_0> Artifact windows <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place buildings <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation delivering <extra_id_0> Transporter he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact package <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation rushing back <extra_id_0> Destination capital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Iv\u00e1n Duque <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize identified <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject driver <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Identifier Investigators <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifiedRole Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation carrying <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact pentolite <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle SUV <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker cartel <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact talks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Killer rebels <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime kidnappings <extra_id_0> Perpetrator it <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Target pipelines <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker it <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact talks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place capital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place mall <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim woman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place mall <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die injured <extra_id_0> Victim 11 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast <extra_id_0> Place university <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Place capital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle damaged <extra_id_0> Instrument materials <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Multiple outlets, law enforcement officials, and President Obama responded throughout a manic Monday with news that a horrific looking scene made clear in downtown Boston, even as a frenzied search for more potential explosive devices continued and hospitals rushed to help survivors: The crowd at the finish line of the Boston Marathon was bombed twice in what is being described as both a coordinated \"event\" and \"an act of terror\" with more than 140 people brutally injured at eight Boston hospitals and at least three dead, including a young child.Indeed, even as a city and a nation came together amidst the chaotic scene, there was not much good news in Boston this April 15 \u2014 the annual Patriot Day, a Massachusetts festival holiday with schools and offices closed for the marathon and, on this particular day, tragedy in the happiest of places.The FBI has taken over \"a potential terrorist investigation,\" FBI special agent in charge Richard DesLauriers said at a Monday evening press conference.\"There is no suspect\" at the hospital, Boston Police commissioner Ed Davis said at the briefing, despite reports to the contrary \u2014 and speculation that there was still one or multiple persons of interest being questioned at the hospital.When asked if there was a person of interest at the hospital, DeLaurio declined to comment; he also declined to comment on a Wall Street Journal report that there were five additional devices, which was soon clarified to note that \"investigators now doubt the devices were bombs\" \u2014 just one of many conflicting reports citing anonymous law enforcement officials as the investigation began.(And that's not counting the conspiracy theories.)After the death toll had stood at two for much of the day, Davis confirmed at the evening event that \"at least three people have died\" in the marathon bombing.Governor Deval Patrick said \"we are asking that everyone be at a state of heightened vigilance\" as Boston planned to re-open on Tuesday, though he said it \"will not be business as usual.\"Boston police and the FBI were scheduled to hold another news conference at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday morning.At a late afternoon press conference with Patrick, Davis initially reported a third explosion at JFK Library in Boston, which has since been given the all-clear as a separate fire.At a second police briefing, Davis said \"we have no suspect in custody,\" as CNN reported that the FBI had classified the event as a terrorist attack.Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein classified it as a \"terrorist incident\" that \"could be be foreign, could be homegrown.\"At a White House briefing shortly after 6 p.m. Eastern time on a quiet day in Washington, President Obama reiterated that federal and local investigators are still in the investigation phase.He did not use the words \"terror\" or \"terrorist\" or \"attack,\" instead using the words \"unnecessary loss\" \u2014 \"America will say a prayer for Boston tonight,\" he said \u2014 before delivering a more forceful message:We don't yet have all the answers ...We still do not know who did this or why...But make no mistake we will get to the bottom of this.We will find out who did this ... and any responsible groups will feel the full weight of justice.NBC News and others reported that the White House said the bombings would be \"approached as an act of terror.\"Both Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will meet with Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel on Tuesday.As the investigation continues and news reports continue to make sense of the fallout, you can follow the Boston police scanner, the Boston Globe live blog, and the local CBS, ABC, and Fox stations \u2014 as well as some solid Twitter lists.The basic details of the bombings, however, are starting to come into focus.After two explosions hit at around 2:50 p.m. Boston Police would go on to confirm at least three dead \u2014 NBC News cited law enforcement officials as saying one was an eight-year-old child, a report confirmed by the Boston Globe \u2014 and 141 injuries.As for the two bombs that caused the carnage, it appears they were fairly unsophisticated devices, perhaps pipe bombs stuffed with ball bearings, which doctors later reported pulling out of victims' flesh.ABC News reported that the explosions were triggered by remote detonation, but there's still strikingly little known about the other specifics.Meanwhile, there were gruesome images and raw footage from Copley Square area to makeshift tents, from Boston hospitals to Instagram feeds, of lost limbs, hair on fire, children with severe burns, and worse.Scroll down for all the details on the victims, the persons of interest, the moment of horror, and eyewitness accounts.You can follow all of The Atlantic Wire's ongoing Boston Marathon bomb coverage right here \u2014 and our Day Two aftermath updates here.The CasualtiesThe Boston Marathon is tracking runners here, and for those looking for information on loved ones, here are the best ways online.Also, phone numbers: for families of victims, call 617-635-4500; for tips, call 1-800-494-TIPS.The Boston chapter of the American Red Cross said on Monday evening that there was no need for additional blood donations \"at this time\" as their shelves were full.The Red Cross also opened a disaster response center for the recovery effort.Reports of casualties are largely unconfirmed and varying, but here they are, updated in relative real time.In a Monday night press conference, Dr. Peter Fagenholz, a trauma surgeon at Mass.General Hospital, explained that most of the casualties were vascular, bone-related or soft tissue injuries, and that there had been \"several\" amputees.Fagenholz explained that he started his day in surgery at 8 a.m., and after the explosion worked nonstop until the press conference.Other local hospitals \u2014 some of the best in the nation \u2014 are flooded:Injury count as of 745 pm by hospital: Boston Children\u2019s 8; Brigham 27; BMC 23; MGH 22; BI 21; St E's, 15; Tufts 9 \u2014 The Boston Globe (@BostonGlobe) April 16, 2013An update at the official law enforcement press conference Monday night put the casualty count at 141 injured, at least 15 of them critically.CNN reported that at least ten limbs were lost due to the explosions and doctors were picking ball bearings, a common shrapnel generator in pipe bombs, out of victims.The New York Post reported 12 casualties, and is further reporting that authorities say a suspect in detention is a Saudi national\u2014officials have not confirmed this and Boston PD has not confirmed this.CBS News is reporting that Boston PD has video of someone \"bringing multiple backpacks to blast site.\"There are various reports on Twitter of a suspect being detained, but Davis, the police commissioner, maintainted taht \"we have no suspect in custody,\" seeming to cast doubt on reports quoting a federal law enforcement official in the Post and elsewhere.Among the reported 141 injured a nine-year-old girl, a seven-year-old boy, a 12-year-old, and a two-year-old, according to The Boston Globe.Of the three dead, one is reportedly an eight-year-old boy.The \"Person of Interest\"For now, Boston Police say that there are no suspects, but when asked about scattered reports about a person of interest, officials \u2014 including the new FBI investigator \u2014 would not comment, though law enforcement officials maintain, however anonymously, that there are several active leads.Throughout the day and ahead of other media outlets, a law enforcement official kept telling the New York Post about a \"Saudi national\" as a potential suspect or person of interest, leading to many questions as well as similar reports from Fox News.Another report in the Los Angeles Times said one person \u2014 not a \"suspect,\" but apparently a Saudi national \u2014 was being questioned.\"A federal law enforcement officials said authorities were questioning a Saudi national who was taken to a Boston hospital with injuries,\" the report reads.\"The person was not identified as a suspect.\"Later on Monday evening The Globe reported that authorities were \"questioning person of interest in Marathon bombings at Brigham and Women's Hospital\" but did not provide any details about the person's nationality.However, the paper maintains, \"The situation remains fluid and it remains too early to establish the cause and motivation.\"Officials didn't offer much more clarity at the official press conference on Monday night and appear to be approaching the situation with caution.The New York Times reports, \"Although investigators confirmed that they were speaking to a Saudi citizen, several law enforcement officials took pains to note that no one was being held in custody.\"Meanwhile, the FBI is asking for people to send in any info \u2014 photos, video, tips \u2014 or to call 1-800-CALL-FBI with information regarding the explosions.The investigation remains in the early stages, and the public is clearly pouncing on any sign of a lead.Reports of a police search at a Revere, Mass.condo complex between five and six on Monday night lit up Twitter.However, it's unclear if the search was related to a bombing or not.The Other DevicesSoon after the initial explosions, Boston Globe photographer David L. Ryan reported that he heard but did not see a third explosion, and Boston police were scrambling to contain the scene.\"There were two booms heard from near the finish line\" reports the AP.A spokeswoman at the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel, close to the explosion, says that it was around two blocks away, while The Boston Globe said that police were conducting a \"controlled explosion\" on the 600 block of Boylston Street.Over the course of the afternoon and evening, police say they found five additional devices along the marathon route, though a police source later said it was unclear if they were actually bombs.That number does not include numerous reports of suspicious packages around Boston and neighboring cities.The Boston Globe reported another device found near Harvard, and there was a bomb threat phoned in near the Financial District.There were also reports of undetonated devices being found as far away as Newton, though local police have denied those claims.Again, the Journal walked back its initial claim of the five unexploded devices.And then there was the library fire, which had a whole back-and-forth narrative of its own.Here's an updated interactive map of the at times confounding activity, including multiple reported incidents about unconfirmed devices, fires, and all the explosions throughout Monday, both alleged and confirmed, for a sense of scale in downtown Boston and beyond \u2014 even as the day seemed to settle on the two explosions near the finish line:The FBI said on Monday evening that local police and federal agents would sweep the entire length of the course to look for evidence and additional devices.Meanwhile, the Navy has sent an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team to help with the effort.The Pictures and Video of the ExplosionHere are a couple of many images to flow in from social media early on:Explosion at coply twitter.com/Boston_to_a_T/\u2026 \u2014 Boston to a T (@Boston_to_a_T) April 15, 2013And one more:Just heard that bombs went off at #boston marathon finish line twitter.com/chanyasulkit/s\u2026 \u2014 Chris Chanyasulkit (@chanyasulkit) April 15, 2013Here is perhaps the most shocking, dramatic, and up-close video from the bombings, via the Globe:Here is the moment of impact for the first of the two confirmed explosions, by way of Twitter's Vine, right near the sidewalk (scroll down for video of both):We're going to link to these next two shots (WARNING \u2014 they are graphic) since they show the chaos and some of the injuries, and there are a few very graphic images that have been uploaded to Reddit.NECN's Jackie Bruno reports that the injuries there are gruesome:I saw people's legs blown off.Horrific.Two explosions.Runners were coming in and saw unspeakable horror.\u2014 Jackie Bruno (@JackieBrunoNECN) April 15, 2013To be sure, this is a time to be good to each other.Because there are as many unconfirmed reports and speculative ideas (CBS News reported that certain terrorist target areas are being monitored in Boston, and the Secret Service set up a perimeter around the White House) as there are graphic images.There are amputations.Here are some of the first photos to hit the AP wire (WARNING \u2014 it is graphic):This photo from Reuters photographer John Tlumacki quickly became the iconic image of the day:Check out this Tumblr post where you can see Tlumacki taking the photo.And one more from The Boston Globe:boston marathon explosion twitter.com/GlobeDavidLRya\u2026 \u2014 David L. Ryan (@GlobeDavidLRyan) April 15, 2013Here are more photos from The Atlantic's In Focus blog.Here's video of the first explosion:And another close-up video from the explosion:Here's how a marathon runner saw things:And here's another angle with a second explosion in the distance.Here is the photo of Obama on the phone with FBI Director Robert Mueller (official White House photo by Pete Souza):Here is text of President Obama's full remarks at the White House.Adding further heartbreak to utter tragedy, the 26th mile marker in this year's marathon was actually dedicated to the victims of Newtown.The Eyewitness AccountsThe size of the crowd has yielded countless eyewitness accounts of the horrific scene.One of the more powerful ones we've read comes from The New York Times, which spoke to Rhode Island state trooper and former Marine Roupen Bastajian.\"These runners just finished and they don\u2019t have legs now,\" said Bastajian.\"So many of them.There are so many people without legs.It's all blood.There's blood everywhere.You got bones, fragments.It's disgusting.\"Several of those reporting on the explosions were actually runners in the marathon, so there is no shortage of eyewitness accounts.Two worth reading come from The Wall Street Journal reporter Coleen McCain Nelson and Boston Globe photographer John Tlumacki.Our own Richard Lawson, a Boston native, describes what the scene of the end of the marathon is like on a typical year:Marathon Monday is one of Boston's most celebratory days, with schools and offices closed and people lining the streets cheering runners on for essentially all 26.2 miles of a course which works its way further and further into town.By the time the Boston Marathon reaches the final stretch down narrow Boylston Street, it has entered the busy commercial district of Copley Square.The historic Boston Public Library is on the runners' right, ahead of them the open area of Copley Square Park and the famous Trinity Church.And of course the culmination of all that is the final downtown stretch, as spirited and jovial a scene as there is in Boston at any time throughout the year.The crowd on marathon day is dense and varied \u2014 locals and tourists and running enthusiasts from all over show up hours ahead to secure a good view of the finish line.And of course, there are the runners themselves, still streaming across the finish line for hours after the big winners are crowned.\u2014Richard LawsonAs the day wound down and everyone struggled to process what had happened, Astronaut Chris Hadfield sent a sympathetic dispatch from the International Space Station.\"A somber Spring night in Boston,\" he said, including this aerial photo of the city:Closer to home, some folks at MIT paid tribute to the patriotic spirit with an entire building:Stay tuned for the Wire's Day Two live blog and more at our Boston Marathon hub.Want to add to this story?Let us know in comments or send an email to the authors at , aabadsantos at theatlantic dot com or matt dot sullivan at theatlantic dot com.You can share ideas for stories on the Open Wire.Adam Clark EstesAlexander Abad-SantosMatt Sullivan", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombed <extra_id_0> Target Boston Marathon <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator Richard DesLauriers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant terrorist <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Target JFK Library <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator investigators <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact meet <extra_id_0> Participant Chuck Hagel <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim child <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator Richard DesLauriers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact confirmed <extra_id_0> Communicator Davis <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place event <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator Deval Patrick <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Davis <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator Davis <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient CNN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator CNN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient White House <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reporting <extra_id_0> Communicator CBS News <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Boston PD <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic video <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Lawyers for the coroner in charge of inquests into the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings have said the hearings will not resolve the \u201cenduring injustice\u201d for victims and their families.Sir Peter Thornton QC is challenging a High Court ruling which ordered him to reconsider his decision to exclude an enquiry into the identities of those who \u201cplanted, planned, procured and authorised the bombs\u201d.The bombings in two city centre pubs, widely believed to be the work of the IRA, killed 21 people and injured 182 \u2013 making it the deadliest peacetime attack in the UK at the time.For the reasons the coroner gave ... these inquests cannot resolve the enduring injustice. Peter Skelton QC, for the coronerOutlining his submissions to the Court of Appeal, Peter Skelton QC said: \u201cThe 21 people who died in the bombings and their families have suffered an enduring injustice.\u201cSo too have those who were injured and their families, and countless others who have been affected.\u201cThe pain and grief they have borne has been exacerbated by the fact no-one has ever been held accountable in law.\u201cBut, for the reasons the coroner gave \u2026 these inquests cannot resolve the enduring injustice.\u201dMr Skelton, representing the coroner, added that the victims, their families and the public interest \u201ccannot be served\u201d by a promised resolution that \u201ccannot be delivered\u201d.Two High Court judges quashed a decision by Sir Peter to exclude the \u201cperpetrator issue\u201d from the new hearings following a judicial review brought on behalf of the bereaved families by Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was 18 when she was killed in the bombings.Ten of the families were in court on Tuesday to hear the appeal before the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Burnett, Lady Justice Hallett and Lord Justice McCombe.They are also arguing it is necessary for the inquests to investigate the perpetrator issue because the police investigation into the bombings resulted in a \u201cnotorious miscarriage of justice\u201d.Six men, known as the Birmingham Six, were imprisoned for the murders and served 17 years behind bars in one of Britain\u2019s most infamous miscarriages of justice before their convictions were quashed.Five West Midlands Police officers were charged with perverting the course of justice in connection with the original criminal investigation, but a judge ruled in 1993 that a fair trial would be impossible.There has never been an effective and independent investigation into who was responsible for the atrocity Hugh Southey QC, for the familesHugh Southey QC, representing the families, said there was the \u201cmost pressing need for a thorough investigation\u201d.He told the court: \u201cThe actions of West Midlands Police officers in the investigation and subsequent criminal convictions are often considered to be the worst miscarriage of justice in British legal history.\u201cThere has never been an effective and independent investigation into who was responsible for the atrocity.\u201cThere is no prospect of such an investigation occurring, apart from within the inquest.\u201cDespite that, the appellant decided not to investigate the issue of who was responsible.\u201dMr Southey later added: \u201cThere is the utmost public interest in the proper investigation of who was responsible for the Birmingham bombings.\u201cThe families of the deceased said to the appellant that the investigation of this issue was so important to them that if it did not form part of the scope of the inquest \u2018we may as well not have an inquest at all\u2019.\u201dSpeaking before the hearing, Mrs Hambleton said: \u201cIt will be utterly redundant to have the inquests unless the perpetrators, their associates and those who prepared and planted the bombs are included.\u201dShe said supporters of the families\u2019 campaign group Justice4the21 have so far raised \u00a375,000 for the case after Mrs Hambleton was refused legal aid.The group held a demonstration outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London in February, supported by members of the Football Lads Alliance.The hearing is due to finish on Tuesday afternoon and the judges are expected to give their ruling at a later date.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Target pub <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>

{"text": "French police are hunting a suspect believed to have deposited a paper bag containing a device that exploded on Friday, wounding 13 people on a busy pedestrian street in the city of Lyon.France\u2019s counter-terrorism prosecutor, Remy Heitz, said an investigation has been opened for an \u201cattempted murder in relation with a terrorist undertaking\u201d and \u201ccriminal terrorist association\u201d.He said no group had yet claimed responsibility for the explosion. Regional authorities said 13 people had suffered mostly minor injuries but 11 were still in hospital on Saturday morning.On Friday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, called the explosion an \u201cattack\u201d.Heitz described video surveillance that showed the suspect heading toward the centre of Lyon by bike on Friday afternoon. The man was seen arriving on foot, pushing his bike along the pedestrian-only Victor Hugo street, then leaving a paper bag on a concrete block in the middle of the street near a bakery.French police issued this photo from CCTV showing a man wanted in connection with the explosion. Photograph: Police National/Handout/EPAThe suspect immediately returned to his bike and left by the same path. One minute later, the explosion shattered the glass of a refrigerator in the bakery, Heitz said.Investigators at the scene have found screws, metallic balls, batteries, a triggering device that can be used remotely and plastic pieces that may come from the explosive device.Police issued an appeal for witnesses on Saturday with a photo of the suspect from video surveillance. They described the man as dangerous. The man was wearing a cap and sunglasses that partially hid his face.Local authorities said security has been enhanced in France\u2019s third-largest city, including more police and military patrols.The Women\u2019s Football World Cup is scheduled to start in France on 7 June. Lyon will host the semi-finals and then the 7 July final. After the explosion, the interior minister, Christophe Castaner, sent instructions for Lyon authorities to strengthen security for \u201cpublic sites and sporting, cultural and religious events\u201d.On Victor Hugo street, police removed the cordon around the explosion area and the atmosphere on Saturday was almost back to normal, with people doing their shopping \u2013 the only oddity being the chalk lines drawn by forensics on the ground.\u201cIt was scary,\u201d said Gisele Sanchez, owner of a haberdashery close to the bakery. Large wood planks covered her shop window, which was damaged by the blast. Police found in her shop screws, metallic balls and batteries believed to be from the device, yet Sanchez was able to reopen on Saturday morning.France is jittery over a spate of attacks in recent years, some of them deadly, carried out by people ranging from extremist attackers to mentally unstable individuals. Five people were killed on 11 December in an attack on the Christmas market in Strasbourg, eastern France.

The older of the alleged Marathon bombers, Tamarlan Tsarnaev, started attending Friday prayers at the Islamic Society of Boston, in Cambridge, about a year-and-a-half ago.Anwar Kazmi, a member of the executive board of the Islamic Society of Boston, addresses reporters Monday. (Fred Thys/WBUR)Tsarnaev called attention to himself during one prayer service earlier this year. It happened on Jan. 18 \u2014 the Friday prayers just before Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\"The theme of the sermon was about great men like Dr. Martin Luther King, like the prophet, what drove them, their sense of mission, what we could learn from their lives and how we could be inspired by their example, and so when the person who was giving the sermon began to talk about King, [Tsarnaev] got up and objected and raised his voice, which is against the etiquette of the sermon,\" Anwar Kazmi, a board member of the Islamic Society of Boston Trust, told reporters Monday in front of the small mosque on busy Prospect Street in Cambridge.Kazmi said different people have different memories of what Tsarnaev said that day. Kazmi said some people reported Tsarnaev objected to comparing King to the prophet Mohammed. Others have reported he called the speaker a hypocrite. Kazmi said after the incident, people sat down with Tsarnaev and explained to him that he could not interrupt the sermon.\"And he seemed to understand and nothing happened after that,\" Kazmi said. \"He continued to come to the mosque even after the incident.\"Kazmi said one man remembers a positive experience with Tsarnaev. The man ran out of gas, and Tsarnaev ran over to his apartment, got a gas can, filled it up, and brought it to the man.Kazmi said Tsarnaev's younger brother, Dzhokhar, only came once to Friday prayers.\"And I have been told that on occasion, they would also come here for the dawn prayers, and that the younger one sometimes came accompanied by his older brother,\" Kazmi said. \"The younger one never came here by himself.\"Kazmi said several members of the congregation are still being interviewed by the FBI about the brothers.

It is frustrating to hide the facts,\" a senior interior ministry official in Kabul said.The complex attack on a highly secured base underlined the heavy pressure facing Afghan security forces as increasingly confident Taliban fighters have stepped up operations, even as diplomatic efforts to agree a peaceful settlement to the conflict have begun.Local officials said scores of troops and security personnel were killed in the attack. ( Tolo News via Storyful )Taliban insurgents, fighting to drive out international forces from Afghanistan and reintroduce their version of strict Islamic law, claimed responsibility for the attack, which spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said killed 190 people.The attack, the most serious against Afghan forces in months, occurred on the same day that Taliban representatives met Zalmay Khalilzad, the US special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, in Qatar.Last week, Taliban fighters set off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five people and wounding more than 110 in the capital Kabul, but casualties from Monday's attack appear to have been far higher.'Many more were killed'Sharif Hotak, a member of the provincial council in Maidan Wardak, said he saw the bodies of 35 members of the Afghan forces in the hospital.\"Many more were killed. Several bodies were transported to Kabul city and many injured were transferred to hospitals in Kabul,\" said Mr Hotak, adding that \"the Government was hiding the accurate casualty figures to prevent a further dip in morale of the Afghan forces.\"Monday's attack caused the biggest casualty total suffered by Afghan forces since August 2018, when the Taliban overran central Ghazni province.That confrontation killed 150 Afghan security forces and 95 civilians, as well as hundreds of Taliban fighters, officials said at the time.President Ashraf Ghani's office said in a statement the \"enemies of the country\" had carried out the attack and had killed and wounded \"a number of our beloved and honest sons\".In recent years the Afghan Government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures but US commanders have said repeatedly that the losses being suffered by Afghan forces are \"unsustainable\".Last year Mr Ghani said 28,000 Afghan police officers and soldiers had been killed since 2015.The British embassy in Afghanistan said Monday's casualties were \"a stark reminder of the sacrifice the Afghan security and defence forces make for their country\".Reuters", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize saw  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounding <extra_id_0> Victim 110 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injurer fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> Attacker fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place highly fortified compound <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target 110 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack confrontation  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place training centre <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Thai Police Arrest Bombing SuspectBANGKOK \u2014\u00a0Police in Thailand arrested a suspect Saturday in connection with the bombing earlier this month that killed 20 people.The man, described as a foreigner, was being charged with possessing explosives and was in military custody, authorities told reporters.The suspect was also found with ball bearings, fuses, pipes and other bomb-making materials, as well as a stack of Turkish passports, police and army officials said.All Thai television channels carried a brief broadcast by the Thai military junta at 6 p.m. Saturday announcing the arrest.National police chief General Somyot Poompanmoung speaks to reporters outside the compound where police detained a suspect in the August 17 Bangkok shrine bombing, in a Bangkok suburb on Aug. 29, 2015.It was the first big breakthrough since the August 17 blast at the popular Erawan Hindu Shrine in central Bangkok killed 20 people \u2014 Thais, Chinese, Malaysians, a Singaporean and an Indonesian \u2014 and wounding more than 100 people of numerous nationalities.The bombing was the worst single mass casualty attack in Thailand.It was followed a day later by an explosion in the Chao Praya river adjacent to the Sathorn pier, about five kilometers away from the shrine. No one was injured in that detonation.Authorities believe a separate man on the King Taksin Bridge, around the time of the shrine blast, had dropped a time bomb into the river.The military junta\u2019s announcement came hours after a \u201cforeign man,\u201d said to be 28 years of age, was taken into custody on the eastern fringe of Bangkok.A police source said the arrest of the suspect, who is believed to be Turkish, came after investigators sifting through records of mobile phone calls identified three Turkish numbers, which had been activated by international roaming services near the blast site, according to the Sunday edition of the Bangkok Post. Earlier, authorities had told reporters that a tip from a landlord had led them to the suspect whose apartment building was surrounded by more than 100 police and soldiers on Saturday. Thai police stand on the balcony outside of an apartment building in Nong Jok on the outskirts of Bangkok, Aug. 29, 2015. Thai police say they arrested a suspect in the blast at the Erawan Shrine in this apartment building.The bomb-making materials found at the apartment were similar to those used at the Erawan Hindu Shrine and were linked to the second explosion as well.The suspect's identity remained unclear, but \"we found he's connected to both Bangkok blasts,\" said national police spokesman Prawut Thavornsiri. \"We believe the perpetrators are from the same group.\u201dThe Thai national police chief told reporters Saturday evening that the attacks were \u201cnot an international terrorist act.\u201dA handout photo from the Royal Thai police and released on August 29, 2015 shows the suspect which is being detained at a police station in Bangkok.The motive by the main culprit was instead \"taking personal revenge for his comrades,\u201d asserted Police General Somyot Pumpanmuang, without elaborating on how authorities had quickly reached that conclusion.The suspect was being questioned late Saturday in the presence of officials of the Turkish Embassy, local media reported.Police released a copy of the photo page of one of the Turkish passports with the arrested man\u2019s photo. It was quickly alleged on social media that the passport was a crude forgery with two dates of expiry and several misspellings in Turkish.A search was underway for more than 10 additional suspects, some of whom were already believed to have left the kingdom, police said, but they had been ruled out as being part of a wider international terrorist network.The Thai police have come under criticism for their investigation, in which they had released contradictory information about possible suspects in the bombing.The prime suspect was captured on closed circuit television \u2014 a man in a yellow T-shirt who left a bag at the shrine just before the explosion.This Aug. 17, 2015, image, released by Royal Thai Police spokesman Lt. Gen. Prawut Thavornsiri shows a man wearing a yellow T-shirt near the Erawan Shrine before an explosion occurred in Bangkok.Authorities denied to VOA that Chinese were likely the primary target.In recent days speculation had increased about a possible link to China's ethnic Uighur minority or their co-religious sympathizers in Turkey.Thailand\u2019s military government last month forcibly repatriated more than 100 Turkey-bound Uighur refugees to China, a move condemned by international human rights groups.That led to an attack on the Thai consulate in Istanbul where windows were smashed.VOA's Ron Corben contributed to this report.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer Police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact broadcast <extra_id_0> Place Thai <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator junta <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain detained <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Bangkok <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Bangkok <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounding <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place Thailand <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place Chao Praya river <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonation  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim No one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact announcement <extra_id_0> Communicator junta <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain detained <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator media <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle smashed <extra_id_0> Artifact windows <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target consulate <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact asserted <extra_id_0> Communicator Police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Third Friend of Accused Boston Bomber IndictedBOSTON \u2014\u00a0A third college friend of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was indicted on charges he lied to federal investigators, the U.S. Attorney General for Massachusetts said in a statement on Thursday.Robel Phillipos, 19, was one of the three people who removed a backpack full of fireworks and a laptop from Tsarnaev's dormitory room at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth days after the April 15 attack, and later lied about it, prosecutors claim.The two other students, Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov \u2014 both from Kazakhstan \u2014 have already been indicted on obstruction charges and detained pending trial. They have pleaded not guilty.Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan, ethnic Chechens, are believed to have set off a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the world-renowned marathon's finish line, killing three people and maiming scores of others in one of the worst attacks on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001.Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police a few days after the bombing. Dzhokhar was captured and imprisoned pending trial on terrorism charges.According to the indictment against Phillipos, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sent a text message to Kadyrbayev on April 18, shortly after the FBI published pictures of the bombing suspects, asking his friend to go to his \u201croom and take what's there.\u201dThe three men allegedly took the laptop, backpack and other items from Tsarnaev's room later that day and put them in a dumpster in nearby New Bedford. Investigators later recovered the items from a landfill, according to the indictment.Phillipos, along with Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov, concealed his actions during interviews with federal investigators between April 19 and April 25, according to the indictment.\u201cIn so doing, he made numerous false and misleading statements to the agents,\u201d according to the statement from the office of U.S. Attorney General for Massachusetts Carmen Ortiz.Phillipos, who has been under house arrest since May, faces up to 16 years in prison if convicted. Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov face up to 25 years in jail or deportation.Next year's Boston Marathon will include an additional 9,000 runners, boosting the field size to 36,000, amid a groundswell of support and interest in the wake of the bombing attack, the marathon's organizers said on Thursday.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> Attacker Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target line <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize recovered <extra_id_0> Identifier Investigators <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place landfill <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict indicted <extra_id_0> Defendant Dias Kadyrbayev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime removed <extra_id_0> Place room <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Perpetrator Robel Phillipos <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict indicted <extra_id_0> Defendant friend <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain imprisoned <extra_id_0> Detainee Dzhokhar <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime lied <extra_id_0> Perpetrator Robel Phillipos <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Boston Bomber Admits Guilt, Receives Death SentenceConvicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev apologized at his sentencing hearing Wednesday before he was formally sentenced to death for the deadly 2013 attack. The 21-year Chechen immigrant stood in a federal courtroom in Boston and admitted that he and his late older brother, Tamerlan, planted two pressure-cooker bombs that exploded near the finish line of the legendary race on April 15, 2013, killing three people and leaving 264 others injured, including 17 who suffered severed limbs. \"I am sorry for the lives that I've taken, for the suffering that I caused you, for the damage I've done, irreparable damage\" Tsarnaev said in his first public remarks since his arrest. But Judge George O'Toole offered no sympathy for Tsarnaev as he handed down the death sentence, saying no one will remember the kind of person he was before the bombing. \"What will be remembered is that you murdered and maimed innocent people, and that you did it willfully and intentionally,\" said O'Toole.Before making his statement, Tsarnaev sat impassively and listened to three hours of testimony from 24 victims and survivors who told how the bombing had adversely affected their lives. The mother of Krystal Campbell, one of the three people killed in the bombing, lashed out at Tsarnaev, saying \"the choices that you made are despicable and what you did to my daughter is disgusting.\"Many of the survivors questioned and even rejected Tsarnaev's expression of remorse, calling it insincere. But one survivor, Henry Borgard, told reporters after the hearing that he accepted Tsarnaev's apology. \"I was actually really happy that he made the statement,\" said Borgard, who was injured as he was walking home from work that day. \"As I said in my personal impact statement, I have forgiven him. I have come to a place of peace and I genuinely hope that he does as well. For me to hear him say that he's sorry, that is enough for me.\" And the father of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was also killed in the attack along with Campbell and Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, said he and his family have moved on. \"He chose hate. He chose destruction. He chose death,\u201d said Bill Richard. \u201cThis is all on him. We choose love. We choose kindness. We choose peace.\u201dThe jury voted unanimously last month to condemn Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death, just days after convicting him on all 30 charges brought against him -- 17 of which carried the possibility of the death penalty. In addition to the three bombing victims, Tsarnaev was also convicted in the death of Sean Collier, a police officer with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department killed during a shootout with the Tsarnaev brothers three days after the attack.His attorneys argued during the penalty phase of the trial that Dzhokhar was under the strong influence of his radicalized older brother, who was killed in the same shootout that killed MIT police officer Collier.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will likely be sent to a federal prison in Indiana to await execution -- a process that could take years as his lawyers appeal his case through the federal court system.

{"text": "FBI Looking for 2 Men Who Allegedly Found Explosive Device in NYCThe U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is asking the public for help in locating two men who allegedly found a piece of luggage on a New York sidewalk that contained an explosive device that may be tied to the suspect in Saturday's bombings in New York and New Jersey.On Wednesday the FBI issued a statement and a photo of two men that was taken on Saturday, September 17, in the same hour an explosive device detonated. The FBI said the men took the luggage, which was located only four blocks or so from the New York bombing site, and left the device behind. That device did not detonate.Federal investigators said during a news conference Wednesday the men are wanted as witnesses only.Federal investigators said earlier the suspect in Saturday's bombings in New York and New Jersey has been charged with use of a weapon of mass destruction in the weekend attacks. Investigators said he bought components on eBay and used as triggering devices cell phones purchased from a store 500 meters from an address he once listed as his home.Evidence teams investigate at the scene of Saturday's explosion on West 23rd Street in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood in New York, Sept. 19, 2016. Ahmad Khan Rahami, a U.S. citizen of Afghan descent has been charged in the bombing.Multiple federal chargesThe details are contained in criminal complaints made public Tuesday spelling out multiple federal charges against 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami. Most of the charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.Authorities arrested Rahami on Monday after an exchange of gunfire with police that left him and two officers wounded.According to the court documents, investigators believe Rahami used an eBay account with the username \"ahmad rahimi\" to buy citric acid, a circuit board, electric igniters and hundreds of ball bearings between June 20 and August 10. The items were shipped to a business in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, where Rahami worked until September 12.Ball bearings were found in two pressure cooker bombs placed four blocks apart in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York late Saturday. One of them exploded, injuring 29 people, while the other was recovered intact. Investigators said the second bomb had \"numerous\" electric igniters.That second device was tested for fingerprints, and the criminal complaint said all 12 prints found were matches for Rahami. The documents say his prints were also found on items inside of a backpack that was discovered late Sunday at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, just outside of New York. The bag contained multiple explosive devices, including one that blew up as police tried to disarm it with a robot.Authorities also tied Rahami to a bomb that blew up in a trash can in Seaside Park, New Jersey, early Saturday.That link involved one of the cell phones that investigators said were shipped last year to a store in Perth Amboy near the address that Rahami provided as his home in a 2012 passport application. They said a second phone shipped to the same place was used in the bomb that blew up in Chelsea.A third phone, one found with the other Chelsea bomb, was once registered to one of Rahami's family members, the documents said.A still image captured from a video from WABC television shows New York bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami being loaded into an ambulance after a shoot-out with police in Linden, New Jersey, Sept. 19, 2016.Surveillance videoInvestigators also said they used surveillance video to tie Rahami to the Chelsea bombs, with cameras putting him near the explosion site about 37 minutes before the blast and near where the other bomb was found two minutes after the first one went off. That second video, they said, showed him pulling a suitcase and then a short time later walking without it.The documents contain some pieces of writing from a journal found on Rahami when he was arrested. The messages include praise of American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011, and \"Brother Osama Bin Laden,\" the former head of al-Qaida who was killed by U.S. forces in Pakistan in 2011.\"Inshallah the sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets. Gun shots to your police. Death To Your OPPRESSION,\" one message reads.The FBI said Tuesday it assessed Rahami's activities in 2014 after his father told agents he was concerned about his son's possible involvement with extremists.The agency found insufficient evidence to warrant further investigation.Rahami was born in Afghanistan, came to the U.S. at age 7 and became a naturalized American citizen.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Place New Jersey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place site <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonate <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Place New Jersey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle destruction <extra_id_0> Instrument weapon <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Instrument weapon <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant citizen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell purchased <extra_id_0> Giver store <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity cell phones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell bought <extra_id_0> Recipient he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Giver eBay <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity components <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigate <extra_id_0> Investigator teams <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Target West 23rd Street <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place neighborhood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges <extra_id_0> Defendant Ahmad Khan Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentence  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack gunfire <extra_id_0> Target police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation shipped <extra_id_0> Destination Perth Amboy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact items <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument One <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew up <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice that <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew up <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice that <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Seaside Park <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation shipped <extra_id_0> Destination store <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact phones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation shipped <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact phone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination place <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew up <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Chelsea <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place New York <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shoot-out <extra_id_0> Target police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Linden <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place site <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast <extra_id_0> Place site <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack went off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Yemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strike <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Yemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Killer forces <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Pakistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shots  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator agency <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "An ISIS-inspired Utah teen has been arrested after bringing a homemade bomb to his high school and attempting to detonate it, police said.The student, whose identity was not released, brought the homemade explosive to Pine View High School in St. George inside of his backpack on Monday.An alleged would-be bombing at the 1,100- student school was ultimately thwarted when concerned classmates notified faculty and a school resource officer of the boy\u2019s \u201csuspicious\u201d backpack that had smoke coming out, cops said.The suspect was arrested after the school was evacuated and authorities, including the bomb squad and FBI, investigated.\u201cBased on our investigation we can confirm this was a failed attempt to detonate a homemade explosive at the school,\u201d the St. George Police Department said, adding that after examining the explosive device \u201cbomb squad members indicted that if it had detonated; the device had the potential to cause significant injury or death.\u201dThe department noted that \u201cit was also determined that the male had been researching information and expressing interest in ISIS and promoting the organization.\u201dAuthorities said additional charges may be brought.The teen is also being eyed as a suspect who raised the Islamic State group\u2019s flag on a pole at another Utah high school last month \u2014 one day after the deadly Valentine\u2019s Day shooting rampage at a Florida high school.Police Officer Ken Thompson told the Associated Press that when the search warrant was executed at the teen\u2019s home \u201cthere was evidence taken from the house that tied him to the Feb. 15 flag case at Hurricane High School.No one was hurt during the Monday incident at the high school and no property was damaged.Washington County School District spokesman Steve Dunham said: \u201cI think it is a shock to all of us that something like this has happened in one of our schools.\u201dThe police department hailed the students who notified faculty of the smoking backpack.\u201cTheir immediate action played a large role in this incident ending with no injuries,\u201d the St. George Police Department said.With Post Wires", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee teen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Utah <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation brought <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact explosive <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transporter student <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination Pine View High School <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation evacuated <extra_id_0> Origin school <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigated <extra_id_0> Investigator FBI <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator our <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonate <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosive <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection examining <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injury  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die death  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle damaged <extra_id_0> Artifact property <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure hurt <extra_id_0> Victim No one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "2 New Suspects Sought in Bangkok BombingBANGKOK \u2014\u00a0Thai authorities investigating this month\u2019s deadly Bangkok bomb attack on Monday announced finding more bomb-making materials in a raid on an apartment in the capital and arrest warrants for two new suspects \u2013 a 26-year-old Thai woman and a foreign man.A photograph of the woman, identified as Wanna Suansan, in a hijab and a sketch of the unnamed male suspect were shown on a special broadcast on all Thai television channels at noon.The disclosure came after police raided an apartment building Sunday, initially telling reporters nothing suspicious had been found.But on the Monday broadcast, national police Lt. General Prawut Thavornsiri said fertilizer, explosives detonators and digital watches were seized during Sunday's search of multiple units in an apartment complex in the Min Buri district of Bangkok.Police claim rewardPolice on Monday also announced that a 3 million baht (about $83,000) reward offered to the public for information leading to the arrest of the bombing suspects would instead be paid to the police, after a 28-year-old foreign man was apprehended in a Saturday raid.The suspect faces charges of possessing explosives.\u201cThis was the work of the Thai officials, there were no tip-offs,\u201d the national police chief, General Somyot Pumpanmuang, told reporters as he displayed bundles of the reward cash he said was from his personal funds and a donation from an anonymous businessman friend of his.Officials said they found explosives, chemicals, ball bearings and other elements to make pipe bombs in a unit on the eastern outskirts of Bangkok where they apprehended the foreigner.FILE - Thai police stand on the balcony outside of an apartment building in Nong Jok on the outskirts of Bangkok, Aug. 29, 2015. Thai police say they arrested a suspect in the blast at the Erawan Shrine in this apartment building.The components were said to be similar to those used in devices that detonated at the Erawan Shrine on August 17 and in the Chao Phraya River, adjacent to the Sathorn Pier, the following day.The blast at the Hindu shrine, popular with Chinese and other Asian tourists, killed 20 people and wounded more than 100 others \u2013 the worst single mass casualty attack in Thailand.The subsequent explosion at the pier caused no injuries. Uighur deportationIt is unclear whether the shrine bombing has any connection to Thailand\u2019s deportation in July of more than 100 ethnic Uighurs to China, army commander-in-chief General Udomdej Sitabutr said Monday.Thai authorities have been hesitant to link the attack to international terrorism.Instead, authorities have insisted since Saturday that it is likely connected to a human smuggling organized crime ring or a gang bent on revenge for crackdowns by police.Analysts have given those explanations little credence and human rights groups have expressed concern about how the lack of legitimate political, security and judicial authority in a country under military government could undermine public trust in the investigation\u2019s outcome.The head of the Thai military junta, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, has cautioned against concluding that the shrine bombing was linked to international terrorism or mentioning any possible connection to Turkey.Thai police Lieutenant General Prawut Thavornsiri speaks to the media at the Royal Thai Police headquarters in Bangkok, Thailand, Aug. 30, 2015.In recent days speculation had increased about the bombing\u2019s possible link to China's ethnic Uighur minority or their co-religious sympathizers in Turkey.Thailand's deportation of the Uighurs led to an attack on the Thai consulate in Istanbul where windows were smashed.The Turkish Embassy in Bangkok denied that the arrested suspect is a citizen of Turkey, Lt. General Prawut told reporters on Sunday.Authorities also made conflicting statements Saturday and Sunday on whether they believed the man was the suspect caught on closed circuit television images leaving a package at the popular Hindu shrine in central Bangkok just prior to the explosion.CriticizedThe junta also came under criticism after airing a photograph of a suicide vest while its officials discussed evidence found on Saturday they said was related to the bombings.It was quickly pointed out that the picture of the vest had come from a 2013 blog online of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration.That disclosure prompted Thai authorities to acknowledge the photograph had no connection to their case and they demanded the media and public refrain from further disseminating the picture.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Bangkok <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Jailer man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Jailer suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges <extra_id_0> Defendant suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Jailer they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice devices <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Erawan Shrine <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Chao Phraya River <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast <extra_id_0> Target shrine <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime smuggling <extra_id_0> Perpetrator gang <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime revenge <extra_id_0> Perpetrator ring <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target shrine <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack Bombing <extra_id_0> Target Bangkok <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place Thailand <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing\u2019s  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
