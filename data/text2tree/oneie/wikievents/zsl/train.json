{"text": "What does the statement say?It apologises to the non-combatants, as it puts it. Using quite militaristic terms it refers to combatants, in other words members of the security forces, and non-combatants, in other words civilians.It says that on Bloody Friday, July 21 1972, and on other occasions the IRA's actions resulted in the deaths of non-combatants and the IRA offers its sincere apologies and condolences to their families.How significant is the statement?It is the first time the IRA has apologised in such strong terms.On previous occasions the IRA has said it regrets deaths but never before has it said \"sincere apologies and condolences\".What happened on Bloody Friday? This Sunday will be the 30th anniversary of Bloody Friday - when the IRA planted more than 20 bombs around Belfast.Twenty of them exploded, killing nine people and injuring more than 100 others.The people who died were both Catholics and Protestants - four bus drivers and two soldiers at a bus depot, two women and a 14-year-old boy at a row of shops.The victims came from all sections of the community.Why have the IRA released the statement now?The anniversary is one reason but the IRA is also trying to create a climate in which progress can be made.The statement also says the IRA remains totally committed to the peace process.We can also look back to 4 July when Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern met the pro-Good Friday Agreement parties at Hillsborough Castle.We heard a lot of talk that if paramilitaries on both sides did not show more commitment to the peace process the devolved government at Stormont could run into trouble.Finally, earlier this year, Republicans at an event in Dublin commemorated their dead and that was criticised in many quarters as glorifying what the IRA had done.I think all these reasons create the context in which the statement has been issued.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Contact apologises <extra_id_0> Participant non-combatants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact says <extra_id_0> Participant It <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths <extra_id_0> Victim non-combatants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact offers <extra_id_0> Participant families <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic condolences <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact apologised <extra_id_0> Participant IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack planted <extra_id_0> Attacker IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Belfast <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice Twenty <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact statement <extra_id_0> Topic IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact released <extra_id_0> Participant IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact met <extra_id_0> Participant parties <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Hillsborough Castle <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "'Pure Carnage' Recalled at Boston Marathon TrialA survivor of the deadly 2013 Boston Marathon bombings Thursday described the moments after the attack as \"pure carnage.\"Race spectator Jeff Bauman, who lost both legs in the explosions near the finish line of the race, testified on the second day of the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in a Boston courthouse.Bauman hobbled to the witness stand on prosthetic legs, then told the jury that he bumped into Tsarnaev's older brother Tamerlan along the race course moments before the blasts killed three people and injured another 264.Defense lawyers sought Thursday to limit graphic testimony of the bombing victims, but Judge George O'Toole ruled the jury should hear witness descriptions of the aftermath of the attack.Prosecutors allege the Tsarnaevs were trying to avenge U.S. wars in Muslim countries. By blaming the older brother, defense lawyers hope to convince the jury to not sentence Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyer, Judy Clarke, told the jury Wednesday the 21-year-old native Chechen participated with Tamerlan in setting off the bombs, but said Tamerlan masterminded the plot and deeply influenced his brother to take part in it. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev inadvertently killed his brother, running over him with a car, as they attempted to elude police days after authorities had identified them as suspects in the bombings.In his testimony, Bauman said he thought Tamerlan looked \"very suspicious. He was alone ... was not watching the race. He was not having fun.\"Bauman said he noticed an unattended bag that hid one of the two home-made pressure cooker bombs that defense attorneys acknowledge the Tsarnaev brothers detonated.After the blasts, Bauman, at the race to watch his future wife run, said, \"I looked down and saw my legs. It was pure carnage ... I could see my bones and flesh sticking out.\"He later described Tamerlan Tsarnaev for authorities as they began to search for bombing suspects.Protester outside the John Joseph Moakley federal courthouse where trial for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is being held, Boston, Massachusetts, March 5, 2015.

{"text": "Boston Bombing Suspect Found GuiltyBOSTON \u2014\u00a0Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted on all counts Wednesday in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings by a federal jury that now must decide whether the 21-year-old former college student should be executed.Jurors spent slightly more than 11 hours deciding Tsarnaev's guilt in two days of deliberations after 16 days of testimony.\"It's not something that will ever be over,\" said Karen Brassard, whose ankles and shin were injured by pieces of the bomb. \"You'll feel it forever. It's forever a part of our life. ... I don't know what justice is. I'm grateful to have him off the street.''Two shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the marathon finish line on April 15, 2013, killing three people \u2013 Martin Richard, 8, Chinese student Lingzi Lu, 23, and Krystle Campbell, 29 \u2013 and wounding more than 260 others.Tsarnaev also was convicted in the death of Sean Collier, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology patrol officer shot to death three days later, as Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, attempted to evade police.The defendant, dressed in a blue sweater and dark blazer, looked pale as he entered the courtroom to hear the verdict. His lawyer, Judy Clarke, gave him a brief pat on the back as he sat down.VOA's Fatima Tlisova reported Tsarnaev folded his arms, fidgeted and looked down at the defense table as he listened to one guilty verdict after another on all 30 counts against him, including conspiracy, murder and use of a weapon of mass destruction.There were some families of victims in the courtroom, and their reaction as the verdict was read was very calm, Tlisova observed. She noted, though, they seemed satisfied with the verdict, judging by discussions she had with them outside the courthouse.Seventeen of the counts are capital offenses, making Tsarnaev eligible for the death penalty.\u201cI hope today\u2019s verdict provides a small amount of closure for the survivors, families, and all impacted by the violent and tragic events surrounding the 2013 Boston Marathon,\u201d Boston Mayor Martin Walsh said in a statement. \u201cThe incidents of those days have forever left a mark on our city.\u201dJudy Clarke, left, and David Bruck, defense attorneys for convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, will try to prevent his getting a death sentence. They're shown at the federal courthouse in Boston, Massachusetts, April 6, 2015.Penalty phaseDuring the penalty phase, which could begin as early as Monday, Tsarnaev's lawyers will present so-called mitigating evidence they hope will save his life.That could include evidence about his family, his relationship with his brother, and his childhood in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and later in the volatile Dagestan region of Russia.Tsarnaev's conviction was practically a foregone conclusion: His lawyers admitted he participated in the bombings.But in a bid to save Tsarnaev from a death sentence, defense attorney Clarke argued that Tsarnaev, then 19, fell under the influence of his radicalized older brother. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died when he was shot by police and run over by his brother during a chaotic getaway attempt days after the bombing.\"If not for Tamerlan, it [the bombing] would not have happened,\" Clarke told the jury during closing arguments.Prosecutors laid out evidence that the defendant, an ethnic Chechen who emigrated from Russia a decade before the attack, had read and listened to jihadist materials, and wrote a note in the boat where he was found hiding suggesting the bombing was an act of retribution for U.S. military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries.Jurors' questionsEarlier Wednesday, the jury asked U.S. District Judge George O'Toole to clarify two legal terms.South Boston resident Joe Kebartas, holding a sign reading \"Death Penalty is Murder,\" demonstrates outside the federal courthouse where Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been convicted on all 30 counts, April 8, 2015.They asked about the term \"conspiracy,\" which appears in several of the charges. O'Toole explained it applied to a plot between Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev that existed from February through April 19 of 2013, when the younger brother was caught.Jurors also asked if \"aiding and abetting,\" which also appears in several charges, were separate ideas. The judge said the terms represent a single concept.Massachusetts has not executed anyone since 1947, and Roman Catholic bishops in the state reiterated their opposition to the death penalty on Monday, when the first phase of the trial wrapped up.VOA's Fatima Tlisova contributed to this report from Boston, and some material for this report came from Reuters, AFP and AP.Watch video report from VOA's Zlatica Hoke:Video sizewidthxheightpixelsBoston Jury to Mull Life or Death for TsarnaevShare this video0:03:18\u25b60:00:00/0:03:18\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 6.0MB360p | 8.5MB486p | 70.7MB/*<![CDATA[*/initInfographics({groups:[],params:[{\"Name\":\"embed_code\",\"Value\":\"\\u0026lt;div class=\\\"storify\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;iframe src=\\\"//storify.com/voa_news/boston-bomber-convicted-on-all-counts/embed?border=false\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"750\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" allowtransparency=\\\"true\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/iframe\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;script src=\\\"//storify.com/voa_news/boston-bomber-convicted-on-all-counts.js?border=false\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;noscript\\u0026gt;[\\u0026lt;a href=\\\"//storify.com/voa_news/boston-bomber-convicted-on-all-counts\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u0026gt;View the story \\\"Boston Bomber Convicted on All Counts\\\" on Storify\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;]\\u0026lt;/noscript\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;\",\"DefaultValue\":\"\",\"HtmlEncode\":false,\"Type\":\"String\"}],isMobile:true});Error rendering storify.(function(d){var userInput = Infographics.Param[\"embed_code\"],notRenderedS = d.querySelectorAll(\".storifySnippet:not(.storifySnippetRendered)\"),render = function() {try {var oEval = d.createElement(\"div\");oEval.innerHTML = userInput;} catch(e) {var snippets = d.getElementsByClassName(\"storifySnippet\");var lastSnippet = snippets[snippets.length -

{"text": "HOUSTON \u2013 A 26-year-old man has been sentenced to federal prison following his conviction for attempting to maliciously damage property receiving federal financial assistance, announced U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick. Andrew Schneck pleaded guilty March 27, 2018.Today, U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. handed Schneck a 78-month sentence to be immediately followed by three years of supervised release. The court also imposed a $10,000 fine.On the evening of Aug. 19, 2017, a Houston park ranger observed Schneck kneeling among the bushes in front of the General Dowling Monument located in Hermann Park in Houston. Schneck was holding two small boxes with various items inside to include what appeared to be duct tape and wires. After placing the boxes on the ground per the ranger\u2019s request, Schneck took a drink of clear liquid from a plastic bottle, spit it out and poured the remainder on the ground. The ranger then noticed a timer and wires in the box and notified the Houston Police Department (HPD).The HPD Bomb Squad tested the clear liquid and a white powdery substance found in a small, black aluminum tube which revealed they were nitroglycerin and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), respectively. HMTD is a high explosive organic compound used as an initiating, or primary, explosive. Nitroglycerin is used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of explosives. ln its pure form, nitroglycerin is a contact explosive with physical shock causing it to explode and which degrades over time to even more unstable forms. Nitroglycerin is highly dangerous to transport or use.The FBI Explosive Unit Laboratory examined the items in Schneck\u2019s possession on Aug. 19 and determined them to comprise a fully functioning improvised explosive device.Schneck has been and will remain in custody pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.The FBI and HPD conducted the investigation.

{"text": "Boston Turns Street into Memorial for Bombing VictimsBostonians have transformed the Boston Marathon finish line area into a memorial for the victims of this month's twin bombings.Dozens of people gathered at Boylston Street to lay flowers and display messages of hope for the victims.The memorial includes some of the same guard rails used during the April 15 marathon. Some people tied American flags to the rails and placed dozens of running shoes to show their support. Paper doves tied to nearby trees moved softly in the breeze.On Friday, the U.S. Marshals Service said Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was moved to a prison medical facility as authorities continued to search for information about the attack. The bombings killed three people and injured more than 250 others.Tsarnaev was moved to Federal Medical Center Devens from a Boston hospital, where he had been treated for injuries sustained during his capture last week.A spokesman did not give details about the condition of the 19-year-old, who officials say is recovering from a neck wound.Tsarnaev's brother and alleged co-conspirator, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died in a confrontation with police last week.Also Friday, FBI agents searched for a laptop computer that is believed to belong to Dzhokar Tsarnaev. Agents in white hazmat suits scoured a landfill near the campus of the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, where Dzhokar was a student.In Washington, lawmakers said authorities are trying to determine whether or not the brothers' mother was involved in the radicalization of her two sons. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Dutch Ruppersberger, said she is a \"person of interest.\"The Associated Press reported Friday that the bombing suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, had been added to a federal terrorism database about 18 months before the Boston attack. She has denied her sons were involvement and has even suggested the bombing could have been staged.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev faces a charge of using a weapon of mass destruction, which carries a possible death sentence if he is convicted.New York officials say the suspects were devising a plan to attack Times Square as they were running from authorities. New York Police Chief Ray Kelly says Dzhokhar told investigators they planned to drive to New York to set off their remaining explosives.He says the plan fell apart when they realized the vehicle they had hijacked was running low on gas. When they stopped to refuel, the driver of the car escaped, and alerted police to their location.U.S. investigators questioned the suspects' parents in the Russian republic of Dagestan to try to determine if Tamerlan had contacts with Islamic extremists.

{"text": "Latest news straight to your inbox Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Invalid EmailThe second Birmingham pub bombings pre-inquest review takes place this week. Andy Richards reveals for the first time the tragic story of young victim Marilyn Paula Nash.An early riser for work, council worker John Smith needed to be on autopilot as he set off as usual on the grey, dismal Friday morning that is forever etched in his memory.Normally, he would have had a spring in his step. After all, all the weekend was beckoning. It was a chance for him to unwind from the office graft, and perhaps enjoy a drink or two.But this wasn\u2019t a normal morning. In fact, there had never been another morning quite like it in the West Midlands.The previous night, well, at that stage all the terrible details were not known. Accounts varied, the death toll was rising.Bombers \u2013 everyone knew they were the IRA, although the terror group had not claimed responsibility \u2013 had destroyed two pubs in Birmingham city centre.Nineteen people were dead, several were clinging to life, two of whom would eventually succumb to dreadful injuries.The number of injured seemed to change with almost every news bulletin, but it was steadily increasing, and by now it was more than 150.On the previous night \u2013 November 21, 1974 \u2013 families across the UK had clustered around TV sets and radios, utterly aghast and trying to take in what the news flashes from Birmingham were showing and describing.In the city, and across the Black Country towns of West Bromwich, Dudley, Walsall and Wolverhampton, fear of more attacks, combined with growing anger, was visceral.There had already been a number of reprisal attacks on Irish homes and businesses. The region bristled with tension.John\u2019s head was already full of this as he fastened his coat to leave his Walsall home. Little did he know that the sickening horror of the previous night was on his own doorstep.He stepped out... and into a nightmare scenario.John, now a 74-year-old pensioner and still living in the same terraced property, knows the memories can never be erased.\u201cIt must have been about 7am,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had all heard about the bombs going off in the pubs in Birmingham the night before. The whole area was in shock, people could hardly believe it.\u201dIn his early 30s at the time, on that Friday morning he was intent on catching his usual bus for the daily journey to work at Lichfield Council where he was involved in planning sewerage pipe developments.As he set off from the small close in Pelsall where his family lived, he was confronted by the extraordinary sight of his neighbour, Mr Nash stumbling about in the road \u201clike a lost man\u201d.John remembers his neighbour\u2019s tears and his face \u2013 the face of a man in absolute torment.\u201cHe was simply wandering about, not going anywhere but obviously really upset,\u201d recalls John. \u201cSo naturally I went to him and asked him what was wrong.\u201cHe said his daughter, Marilyn, had been in Birmingham the night before. She still hadn\u2019t come home.\u201dMr Nash was a widower and lived with Marilyn, who was 22, and his son, Robert, in the terraced house next door. John thinks Robert was away studying at university at the time. Either way, there was no-one else at home.With nobody to talk to, Mr Nash\u2019s agony had multiplied with each long hour throughout the blackest of nights.\u201cI tried to comfort him as best I could, but what can you do? What can you say?,\u201d says John. \u201cHis daughter should have been home hours ago. There had been no sign or word of her.\u201cI persuaded him to come back to our house where I left him with my mother before I went on to work. She did her best to help him.\u201dWhatever conversation passed between John\u2019s mother and Mr Nash is not known. Neither is how long the poor man waited for news.But his fears for his daughter were sadly well-founded. She never did come home.It took the authorities some time to confirm that Birmingham shop worker Marilyn Paula Nash \u2013 known as Paula to her family and close friends \u2013 was among the dead.She was an attractive, vivacious young woman, with a hint of Jackie Onassis about her looks and hairstyle.Those tasked with the dreadful job of identifying the dead could only confirm it was her by her wage packet, says John.\u201cI remember that she was a very sweet, very friendly girl,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe was my next door neighbour and a reasonably similar age so, although were were not close, we would always say hello, and pass the time of day. Sometimes we would catch the same bus if we were going into Birmingham for a drink, and we would chat.\u201dA fateful decision by Marilyn to pop into a pub for a quick drink on the way home from work cost her her life.It was the penultimate pay day before Christmas. The pubs in Birmingham were full and business was brisk. Marilyn headed for the Tavern In The Town, the underground bar in New Street which had become a cult drinking hole for students and young workers.So did the bombers. They wrought carnage there, and at the nearby Mulberry Bush at the bottom of The Rotunda.\u201cWhen it became known that Marilyn was among the dead, this whole area was in absolute shock,\u201d remembers John. \u201cThere was a big Irish community locally and a local Catholic club was nearby.\u201cI remember the police ordering the Catholic club to be closed for security reasons for a time.

This will remove any barrier from the families\u2019 solicitors in applying for legal aid funding for the inquest.\u201dThe inquest was re-opened in June last year following a campaign by the families, backed by the Birmingham Mail. The full inquest is expected to take place in September.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Target pub <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack destroyed <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Bombers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure were <extra_id_0> Victim several <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die injuries <extra_id_0> Victim two <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Infect injured <extra_id_0> Victim 150 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target homes <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack going off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim Marilyn Paula Nash <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact says <extra_id_0> Participant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact asked <extra_id_0> Participant I <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact says <extra_id_0> Participant John <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact persuaded <extra_id_0> Participant him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact recalls <extra_id_0> Participant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact says <extra_id_0> Participant John <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact remembers <extra_id_0> Participant John <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact chat <extra_id_0> Participant me <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target Pub <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack came  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew <extra_id_0> Attacker James McDade <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Coventry Telephone Exchange <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Conway <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> StartPosition is <extra_id_0> Employee Conway <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PlaceOfEmployment Dublin <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Oliver Heald QC <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Bologna, August 2, 1980. It was a hot Saturday morning, the first weekend of Italy\u2019s traditional holiday month, and thousands of vacationers jostled their way to and from the trains in Bologna\u2019s central railroad station. In the midst of that noisy crowd someone stopped midway between the second-class waiting room and the coffee bar, put down a heavy suitcase, and quickly left the station. The suitcase contained over forty pounds of explosives, perhaps stable nitroglycerine, connected to a timer. At exactly 10:25 AM it exploded, ripping through the crowd, tearing apart the reinforced concrete walls, and bringing the roof crashing down on hundreds of bodies and parts of bodies.In the bloody aftermath, rescue squads worked for over twelve hours to pull the dead and maimed from the rubble. As they labored, a young neofascist entered a telephone booth across town and dialed Bologna\u2019s leading newspaper. \u201cThis is the Armed Revolutionary Nuclei,\u201d he said. \u201cWe claim responsibility for the explosion in the railway station.\u201d The final toll: eighty-five dead\u2014the eldest an eighty-six-year-old man, the youngest a three-year-old child\u2014and more than two hundred wounded.Eight weeks later, on the evening of September 26, a young man, Gundolf Koehler, tried to place six pounds of explosives in a refuse can at the entrance to Munich\u2019s Oktoberfest. The bomb went off, killing him and twelve others, wounding 215 people. On Koehler\u2019s body were found documents linking him to the illegal paramilitary Defense Sport Group of the neo-Nazi Karl-Heinz Hoffmann, who styles himself the \u201cspiritual descendant\u201d of Adolf Hitler and who has organized military maneuvers in southern Germany for his followers. Arrested along with twenty-four of his militants, Hoffmann was later released for lack of evidence.A week later in Paris a twenty-six pound bomb exploded in front of the rue Copernic synagogue, where hundreds of Jews were gathered for sabbath services. The bomb killed four persons and wounded thirteen; if it had gone off twenty minutes later, when services would have ended, it would have killed scores of worshipers leaving the synagogue. The act was claimed by the European National Fasces (FNE), the same group that had machine-gunned five Jewish buildings in Paris a week earlier.These latest of neofascist massacres have awakened Europeans to what many of them had managed not to see: the maturation over the last five years of what analysts now call Eurofascism\u2014loosely associated but politically aligned neo-Nazi groups, many of them dedicated to terrorism, all of them intent on saving Europe from the twin evils of capitalism and Marxism. While their membership is relatively small, they are well funded and some have access to training camps in Lebanon. In an interview given eight days before the Munich explosion, the PLO leader Abu Ayad revealed that in late 1979 two members of Hoffmann\u2019s group were captured in Lebanon and confessed to him that they and some thirty other European fascists were training at the Falangist camp at Aquru, northeast of Beirut. The Germans told Ayad that their Italian comrades\u2026", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place station <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim eighty-five <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim two hundred <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack went off  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounding <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain Arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Hoffmann <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ReleaseParole released <extra_id_0> Defendant Hoffmann <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place rue Copernic synagogue <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim persons <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim thirteen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Boston Marathon Bomber Apologizes to SurvivorsBOSTON \u2014\u00a0Moments before a federal judge sentenced him to death, Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev rose to his feet Wednesday and apologized to the victims and their loved ones for the first time.\"I pray for your relief, for your healing,'' he said.Amid deep silence in the courtroom, the 21-year-old ethnic Chechen said, \"I am sorry for the lives that I've taken, for the suffering that I've caused you, for the damage that I've done \u2014 irreparable damage.''It was the first time Tsarnaev, who did not speak in his own defense at trial, had addressed the court.After Tsarnaev finished, U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr. began to speak, with his voice breaking several times. He officially imposed the death sentence on Tsarnaev that jurors had recommended unanimously.In May, after a 12-week trial, Tsarnaev was found guilty of killing three people and injuring 264 in the April 15, 2013, bombing at the world-renowned race, where he and his brother, Tamerlan, 26, set off two pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line.Tsarnaev was also found guilty in the fatal shooting of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer three days later as he and his brother fled. Tamerlan was killed during the getaway.Tsarnaev was found guilty of all 30 terrorism and other charges against him. Of those, 17 carried the possibility of a death sentence.During the penalty phase of the judicial proceedings, prosecutors brushed off defense arguments that Tsarnaev was under the strong influence of his older, radicalized brother.Victims speak outBefore the sentencing, a somber-looking Tsarnaev, wearing a dark sport jacket with a collared shirt and no tie, sat between his lawyers and listened as 24 people \u2014 some victims, some survivors \u2014 gave impact statements. They lashed out at him for his \u201ccowardly\u201d and \u201cdisgusting\u201d acts, and several called upon him to apologize, trying to convince him that this would be his last chance to ask for forgiveness.Tsarnaev, his chair turned toward the lectern from which the victims spoke, picked at his beard and gazed downward most of the time, only occasionally looking at the speakers.Patricia Campbell, the mother of Krystle Campbell, 29, who was killed in the attack, was the first person to address the court. She looked across the room at Tsarnaev, seated about 20 feet away, and spoke directly to him.\u201cWhat you did to my daughter is disgusting,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't know what to say to you. I think the jury did the right thing.\u201dKrystle Campbell's best friend, Karen Rand McWatters, who lost a leg in the attack, said Tsarnaev \"can't possibly have had a soul to do such a horrible thing.\u201dIn a message he scrawled in the boat he was found hiding in, Tsarnaev said the attack was retaliation against the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries. McWatters urged Tsarnaev to show remorse to discourage other jihadis from killing people in similar attacks. \u201cYou can save them from these cowardly acts if you really have an ounce of regret,\u201d she said.Rebekah Gregory, a Texas woman who lost a leg in the bombing, defiantly told Tsarnaev she was not his victim.\u201cWhile your intention was to destroy America, what you have really accomplished is actually quite the opposite \u2014 you've unified us,\u201d she said. \"We are Boston strong, we are America strong, and choosing to mess with us was a terrible idea. So how's that for your VICTIM impact statement?\u201d'He is a leech'Several victims condemned Tsarnaev for coming to the U.S. as an immigrant from Russia, enjoying the benefits of living here and then attacking American citizens.\u201cHe is a leech, abusing the privilege of American freedom, and he spit in the face of the American dream,\u201d said Jennifer Rogers, an older sister of slain MIT Officer Sean Collier.Bill Richard, whose 8-year-old son, Martin, was the youngest person killed in the bombing, said Tsarnaev could have backed out of the plot and reported his brother to authorities. Instead, Richard said, \u201che chose hate. He chose destruction. He chose death. This is all on him.\u201dRichard noted that his family would have preferred that Tsarnaev receive a life sentence so that he could have had \u201ca lifetime to reconcile with himself what he did that day.\u201dRichard said his family has chosen love, kindness and peace, adding: \u201cThat is what makes us different than him.\u201dFatima Tlisova of VOA's Russian service contributed to this report from Boston.

Several bodies were transported to Kabul city and many injured were transferred to hospitals in Kabul,\" said Hotak, adding that \"the government was hiding the accurate casualty figures to prevent a further dip in the morale of the Afghan forces.\"\"The explosion was very powerful. The whole building has collapsed,\" he said.Government officials in Maidan Wardak and Kabul declined to comment when asked if they were obscuring the death toll.Two senior officials in the interior ministry said the exact casualty figures were not being disclosed to prevent unrest within the armed forces.\"I have been told not to make the death toll figures public. It is frustrating to hide the facts,\" said a senior interior ministry official in Kabul.A senior NDS official in Kabul said at least 50 people were killed or wounded in the complex attack.Abdurrahman Mangal, spokesman for the provincial governor in Maidan Wardak said 12 people were killed and 12 were injured when the car bomb exploded near the Afghan special forces unit.President Ashraf Ghani's office in a statement said the \"enemies of the country\" had carried out an attack against NDS personnel in Maidan Shahr. \"They killed and wounded a number of our beloved and honest sons.\"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan condemned the attack on Monday evening and extended his condolences to Ghani.Meanwhile, the Taliban said it met with U.S. officials in Qatar on Monday, in the latest round of talks between the insurgents and Washington aimed at bringing an end to the 17-year war.The U.S. has not officially commented on the reported meeting, which follows the last confirmed talks between the two parties in the UAE in December.\"Following American acceptance of the agenda of ending the occupation of Afghanistan and preventing Afghanistan from being used against other countries in the future, talks with American representatives took place today in Doha, the capital of Qatar,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.Taliban representatives have met several times with U.S. officials in recent months, but last week threatened to suspend the fledgling process, lambasting Washington for changing the agenda of the talks and \"unilaterally\" adding new subjects.The insurgents have long refused to hold direct talks with the Kabul government -- despite U.S. pleas -- which the Taliban dismisses as a puppet of Washington.In recent years the Afghan government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures. Last year Ghani has said 28,000 Afghan police officers and soldiers have been killed since 2015, breaking the longstanding suppression on casualty data.Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack. Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline terrorist group said they have killed 190 people in the complex attack.Last week, Taliban fighters set off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five people and wounding more than 110 Afghans and expatriates in the capital, Kabul.On Sunday, a suicide bombing in the southeastern province of Logar left eight policemen dead and another 10 wounded.The Taliban bombing targeted the provincial governor's convoy in Mohammad Agha district. The provincial governor and spy chief traveling in the convoy were unharmed.The Taliban have ramped up their attacks on security forces and government facilities in recent months, while Afghan and U.S. troops have increased operations against the militants' field commanders.Military sources say around 35 members of the country's security forces are killed every day in attacks and clashes.This is while the U.S. is still considering a significant troop drawdown in Afghanistan. Around 14,000 U.S. troops are stationed in the country, coupled with around 7,500 troops from other allied nations, according to RAND, a U.S. government research organization.In a report on Sunday, RAND said that if the U.S. considers \"an early and complete or near-complete departure unrelated to a negotiated peace settlement,\" it could push Afghanistan into a civil war while the Taliban would expand their control throughout the country.If the withdrawal does take place, RAND noted, \"the major advances that Afghans have achieved in democracy, press freedom, human rights, women's emancipation, literacy, longevity, and living standards will be rolled back throughout the country.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Killer The Taliban <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place training center <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack the assault  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target campus <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shot <extra_id_0> Target soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker gunmen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place campus <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Place complex <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize saw <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject bodies <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Identifier he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack suicide bombing <extra_id_0> Place southeastern <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim 10 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim policemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target convoy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact been in touch <extra_id_0> Participant official <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation transported <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact bodies <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination Kabul city <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation transferred <extra_id_0> Destination hospitals <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact injured <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place complex <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounding <extra_id_0> Victim expatriates <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice car bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place highly fortified compound <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact met <extra_id_0> Participant Taliban <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Qatar <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic bringing an end <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack war  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Killer They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim beloved and honest sons <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Injurer They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim beloved and honest sons <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Two drones packed with explosives reportedly flew toward Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Saturday night in what the government has described as a failed assassination attempt.Here's a look at the details:What happened?Assailants launched two drones filled with a total of more than 4 pounds of plastic explosives toward Maduro, his wife and other top Venezuelan leaders, according to the Associated Press.The attack occurred while Maduro was making a speech at a huge outdoor event in Caracas to celebrate the 81st anniversary of the country's national guard. One of the drones was set to explode above the president while the second was set to detonate in front of him, according to Interior Minister Nestor Reverol.The Venezuelan military knocked one of the drones off-course electronically. The second drone crashed into an apartment building about two blocks from where Maduro was speaking to hundreds of troops, Reverol said.Photos taken at the event showed security officers surrounding Maduro with some sort of large black shields as they escorted him away.\"That drone came after me,\" Maduro said. \"But there was a shield of love that always protects us. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll live for many more years.\"Who launched the drone attack?The Venezuelan government alleges that Maduro's political opponents conspired with individuals in Miami and Bogota, Colombia, to try to kill Maduro. They have so far offered no real proof to support this claim, and opposition leaders charge that Maduro is using the attack as an excuse to crack down on his critics.Government authorities said Sunday that they have detained six people \u2013 whom they described as \"terrorists and assassins\" \u2013 in connection with the attack. Among those detained: a man who took part in 2014 protests against the government and a man who had a warrant out for his arrest for attacking a military barracks.Maduro accused the \u201cfar right,\u201d working with conspirators in Miami and Bogota \u2013including Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos \u2013 of launching the attack. Colombia\u2019s government has denied any role in the violence.Maduro, who accuses the U.S. of supporting his opponents, called on President Donald Trump to hold the \"terrorist group\" accountable.John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, said Sunday he would like to see solid evidence to support Maduro's claims.\"If the government of Venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of U.S. criminal law, we\u2019ll take a serious look at it,\" Bolton said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"What is the political and economic situation in Venezuela?Venezuela is in the midst of an economic crisis that has been described as worse than the Great Depression that devastated the United States and much of the rest of the world in the 1930s.The inflation rate is set to hit a stunning 13,000 percent this year. There are shortages of food and medicine and a soaring crime rate, spurring refugees to flee into neighboring countries. More than 600,000 Venezuelans have crossed into Colombia, and Brazil has declared a state of emergency because of all the Venezuelans sweeping into that nation.Maduro is viewed by the United States and other democratic countries as a corrupt, left-wing dictator who imposes strict controls on his people and on the press. He won re-election to a six-year term in May, but the process was widely viewed as a rigged farce.The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Venezuela immediately after the election in an effort to stop Maduro from selling off government debt to enrich himself.What could happen next?Reverol said there could be more arrests. Critics fear an even greater government crackdown on Maduro's political opponents.\"The investigation will get to the bottom of this,\" Maduro said. \"No matter who falls.\"More:Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says drone attack was 'attempt to kill me'More:Venezuelan opposition leaders taken from their homes by state security agents", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Crash crashed <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> CrashObject building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flew <extra_id_0> Vehicle drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation launched <extra_id_0> Transporter Assailants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact speech <extra_id_0> Communicator Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation escorted <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transporter they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack kill <extra_id_0> Target Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain detained <extra_id_0> Jailer authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee whom <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protests <extra_id_0> Topic the government <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrator who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacking <extra_id_0> Attacker who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target barracks <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassination  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand called <extra_id_0> Recipient Donald Trump <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flee <extra_id_0> Destination countries <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact refugees <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation crossed <extra_id_0> Destination Colombia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack kill <extra_id_0> Target me <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain taken <extra_id_0> Detainee opposition leaders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer state <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The threat from multiple homemade bombs detonated nearly simultaneously to kill or maim as many civilians as possible has been a hallmark of militant groups in recent years from Iraq to Israel and Afghanistan and Russia.But until Monday at the Boston Marathon finish line in Copley Square, such street-level bombings targeting sidewalk or marketplace crowds had not taken place on American soil.US law enforcement and intelligence officials across the country and overseas, scrambling to identify the source of the explosives, are now worried that the marathon sidewalk bombing could mark a new chapter in the struggle to secure the American homeland.Advertisement\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this around the world, but what is so concerning about this is that it hadn\u2019t happened here, not like this.Until yesterday,\u2019\u2019 said a senior homeland security official in Washington.The Boston bombs were packed into pressure cookers and hidden in backpacks or duffel bags, according to multiple press accounts citing unidentified sources, another similarity with some Mideast attacks using \u201cimprovised explosive devices,\u2019\u2019 or IEDs.One of the bombs used in a foiled attack in New York\u2019s Times Square in 2010 was fashioned from a pressure cooker.A joint warning issued by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in 2010 said pressure cookers has been used for bombs in multiple attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal.Reports from medical staff at Boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon attack indicate the bombs in this case were packed with BB\u2019s, nails, and other projectiles intended to maximize human carnage.That contrasts with the large truck bombs that were used in Oklahoma City in 1995 and in the garage of the World Trade Center North Tower in 1993, which were intended to inflict damage on buildings, as well as people.IED\u2019s pack a much smaller punch, are cheaper, and easier to carry.They have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan with devastating effect on American troops in convoys of military vehicles.AdvertisementNo one has taken responsibility for the twin bombings on Boylston Street that killed three people and injured more than 150 near the Boston marathon finish line.A senior US law enforcement official in Washington added that the fact that no group has taken responsibility has officials speculating that it might not be the work of a well-known international terrorist group like Al Qaeda, Hezbollah or one of its affiliates but a domestic group or individual inspired by the hallmark tactics of terrorist groups in recent years,The Pakistani Taliban also said in a statement it was not responsible for the attack, unlike the attempted car bombing in New York\u2019s Times Square in 2010 that it claimed responsibility for.But officials in Washington have been warning about the possibility of so-called improvised explosive devises in recent weeks.In late february the White House established a new task force housed in the Department of Justice to apply the lessons learned from years of dealing with so-called improvised explosive devices \u2014 some large and powerful and others more limited in scope like the ones apparently set off on Boylston Street yesterday.\u201cThe threat from IED use is likely to remain high in the near future, and will continue to evolve in response to our abilities to counter them,\u2019\u2019 according to a new strategy approved by President Obama on February 26.\u201cA whole-of-government approach that integrates Federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, and global participation in counter-IED activities will best position the United States to discover plots to use IEDs in the United States, or against U.S. persons abroad, before those threats become imminent.\u2019\u2019AdvertisementThe 2010 warning from the FBI and Homeland Security said \u201cterrorists can exploit the innocuous appearance of easily transportable items such as pressure cookers to conceal IED components.Placed carefully, such devices provide little or no indication of an impending attack.\u2019\u2019\u201cAlertness and quick reaction to discovery of such concealment devices in unusual locations or circumstances can improve chances of early detection and prevention of an attack,\u2019\u2019 the warning continued.Potential indicators of a pressure cooker configured as an IED include protruding wires or fuses, unusual smells such as chemical odors, and wetness or unusual stains on a container.A magazine published during the last decade by Al Qaeda provided bomb-making tips that included using pressure cookers.Instructions for building such bombs also are contained on other websites, including one site that bills itself as an \u201canarchist cookbook.\u2019\u2019", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice

{"text": "A 40-year-old Japanese man admitted he landed an unmanned drone in central Tokyo carrying radioactive sand atop Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's office to protest nuclear power, police said Saturday.The drone, which had a sign on it saying it was radioactive, was carrying a camera and plastic container with sand contaminated with radioactive cesium, Japanese media said. The police said the radiation was low and did not pose a threat. The stunt initially brought fears of a terrorist attack.Yasuo Yamamoto, who is unemployed, faces a maximum three years in prison if convicted on charges of obstruction of official business. Local media reported that the police said the landing was a protest against nuclear power.Abe is pushing to restart Japan's nuclear reactors which are offline in the wake of the Fukushima disaster caused by a tsunami in 2011. Public broadcaster NHK said the sand the drone was carrying came from an area near the Fukushima meltdown.The drone was discovered Wednesday when new employees were taking a tour of the roof. It was believed to have landed there two weeks ago.\u201cI was operating the drone around 3:30 in the morning on April 9 to express my opposition to nuclear power generation,\u201d police quoted the alleged drone operator as saying.The Asahi Shimbun said the man surrendered to police on Friday.

{"text": "Accused New York City Bomber Pleads Not GuiltyAccused New York bomber Ahmad Khan Rahimi pleaded not guilty on Thursday to federal charges that he set off an explosive device in September on a crowded city street, injuring 30 people.Wearing a dark blue jump suit, Rahimi, 28, shuffled slowly into federal court in Manhattan and had several coughing fits during the brief hearing. He suffered serious injuries in a shootout with police two days after the bombing.He spoke only once, when U.S. District Judge Richard Berman asked him to confirm that he intended to plead not guilty to an eight-count indictment filed on Wednesday.\"Yes, sir,\" Rahimi said.Prosecutors have accused the Afghan-born U.S. citizen of setting off an explosion in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Sept. 17. It did not kill anyone but hurt 30 people.The attack came hours after authorities say another pipe bomb planted by Rahimi went off along the course of a charity road race in New Jersey, although that detonation did not injure anyone.Federal prosecutors also say Rahimi left another bomb in Chelsea that did not go off and several explosive devices in a bag at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey.In addition to the New York indictment, Rahimi faces charges from federal and state prosecutors in New Jersey.He was captured after a manhunt that ended when police officers discovered him sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, New Jersey. The confrontation left him with several gunshot wounds, delaying the filing of federal charges and forcing him to make his first court appearance in New Jersey from a hospital bed.Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin told Berman that prosecutors had compiled video clips showing Rahimi's movements on the day of the bombings, including leaving his house carrying bags, walking on West 23rd Street where the device went off and planting the second bomb on West 27th Street.He also said the government has records showing Rahimi purchased bomb components online and DNA evidence tying him to the bombs.Lewin asked Berman to consider a trial date in the \"late winter\" or \"early spring,\" saying the amount of evidence in the case is relatively limited. Berman scheduled court dates for Dec. 19 and Jan. 31 but has not set a trial date.Rahimi's court-appointed defense lawyers declined to comment after the hearing.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges <extra_id_0> Defendant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injurer he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing hearing <extra_id_0> Place court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt Manhattan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack setting off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosion <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Prosecutors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Victim anyone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure hurt <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack went off <extra_id_0> Attacker Rahimi <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injure <extra_id_0> Victim anyone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack go off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice devices <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges <extra_id_0> Prosecutor prosecutors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant Rahimi <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain captured <extra_id_0> Detainee He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounds <extra_id_0> Victim him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack went off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Rahimi <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell purchased <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing hearing <extra_id_0> Defendant Rahimi <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Analysis backs claim drones were used to attack Venezuela\u2019s presidentAnalysis of open source information carried out by the investigative website Bellingcat suggests drones that had been repurposed as flying bombs were indeed used in an attack on the president of Venezuela this weekend.The Venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro using two drones loaded with explosives.The president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred.Initial video from a state-owned television network showed the reaction of Maduro, those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera.But the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions.AP also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim \u2014 suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat.Since then more footage has emerged, including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building.Bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack, including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro\u2019s speech, and using frame-by-frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up.The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s, each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and, when detonated, capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters.DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model, normally used for industrial work \u2014 with a U.S. price tag of around $5,000 apiece, suggesting the attack could have cost little over $10k to carry out \u2014 with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially (for demolition purposes) at a cost of around $30.Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government\u2019s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600, noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors.It also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model, although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed.Venezuela\u2019s interior minister, Nestor Reverol, also claimed the government thwarted the attack using \"special techniques and [radio] signal inhibitors\", which \"disoriented\" the drone that detonated closest to the presidential stand \u2014 a capability Bellingcat notes the Venezuelan security services are reported to have.The second drone was said by Reverol to have \"lost control\" and crashed into a nearby building.Bellingcat says it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion.It adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed.\"It is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated, creating the hole in the wall of this apartment, igniting a fire, and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in Video 2 [of the state TV broadcast of Maduro\u2019s speech],\" it further suggests.Here\u2019s its conclusion:From the open sources of information available, it appears that an attack took place using two DBIEDs while Maduro was giving a speech.Both the drones appear visually similar to DJI Matrice 600s, with at least one displaying features that are consistent with this model.These drones appear to have been loaded with explosive and flown towards the parade.The first drone detonated somewhere above or near the parade, the most likely cause of the casualties announced by the Venezuelan government and pictured on social media.The second drone crashed and exploded approximately 14 seconds later and 400 meters away from the stage, and is the most likely cause of the fire which the Venezuelan firefighters described.It also considers the claim of attribution by a group on social media, calling itself \"Soldados de Franelas\" (aka \u2018T-Shirt Soldiers\u2019 \u2014 a reference to a technique used by protestors wrapping a t-shirt around their head to cover their face and protect their identity), suggesting it\u2019s not clear from the group\u2019s Twitter messages that they are \"unequivocally claiming responsibility for the event\", owing to use of passive language, and to a claim that the drones were shot down by government snipers \u2014 which it says \"does not appear to be supported by the open source information available\".", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument drones

{"text": "Jury Selection Begins in Trial of Accused Boston Bomber's FriendBOSTON \u2014\u00a0Jury selection was set to begin on Monday in a U.S. court in Boston for the trial of the first of three friends of the Boston Marathon bombing suspect, charged with obstructing the investigation into the deadly blasts.Federal prosecutors contend that Kazakh exchange student Azamat Tazhayakov, along with two schoolmates, went to marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth three days after the April 15, 2013, attack and removed a laptop computer and backpack containing empty fireworks shells.One of Tazhayakov's lawyers, Matthew Myers, last week told reporters that his 20-year-old client had rejected a plea deal offered by prosecutors, contending that there was a \u201clack of evidence\u201d to convict the man.A key issue at the trial, set for opening statements next week, will be whether to admit statements that Tazhayakov and fellow Kazakh exchange student Dias Kadyrbayev made to investigators after they were ordered out of their New Bedford, Massachusetts, apartment by heavily armed federal agents and questioned for hours at a police station without having attorneys present.Kadyrbayev, 20, testified at a pretrial hearing early this month that he had not felt that he was free to go during the questioning. The two were arrested on April 20, 2013, on immigration violations.U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock has said he will declare a mistrial if he finds the statements were not voluntary.Three people were killed and 264 injured in the bombing at the historic Boston Marathon.Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov, both charged with obstruction of justice, could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted. A third friend, Robel Phillipos of Cambridge, Massachusetts, faces up to 16 years if convicted of the less serious charge of lying to investigators.Prosecutors have not charged any of the men with a role in the bombing itself. They contend that Tsarnaev, 20, and his brother, Tamerlan, 26, placed two homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the race's crowded finish line and three days later fatally shot a university police officer while attempting to flee the city.Tamerlan died after a gunbattle with police later that night. Dzhokhar is awaiting trial on charges that carry the threat of execution if he is convicted.

{"text": "Bombing Suspects' Parents Questioned in DagestanU.S. investigators have questioned the parents of the two Boston Marathon bombing suspects in the Russian republic of Dagestan, as they try to determine what might have influenced their sons in the months before the April 15 attack.The American authorities, working with Russian security forces, interviewed both parents Tuesday night and called back the suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, for more questioning on Wednesday.The investigators are particularly interested in any contacts the elder brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, might have had with Islamic extremists during a six-month visit to Dagestan and Chechnya last year.U.S. lawmakers discussed the same trip Tuesday as they raised concerns about the sharing of intelligence among federal law enforcement agencies. Senator Lindsey Graham said the FBI told him it was not aware at the time of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's trip to Russia.Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a shootout with police last Thursday, while his younger brother Dzhokhar was captured a day later.Meanwhile, in Boston, authorities on Wednesday reopened Boylston Street, the city thoroughfare where the explosions occurred near the finish line of the race.Later, several thousand people gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a memorial service for campus policeman Sean Collier, who authorities say the Tsarnaev brothers shot to death three days after the bombings.Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano told the Senate Intelligence Committee that her agency did know about Tamerlan's trip, but that an FBI alert on him had expired by the time he returned.The FBI had interviewed Tsarnaev in 2011 at Russia's request, but found nothing to connect him to terrorism at that time.The 19-year-old Dzhokhar has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction. He is in federal custody in a Boston hospital.U.S. officials say Dzhokhar told them in preliminary interviews that he and his brother were partly motivated by the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but that they were self-radicalized and not connected to any terrorist network. The two suspects are Chechens who came to the United States as boys.The brothers allegedly set off two bombs alongside the Boston Marathon course, killing three people and injuring 264.

{"text": "In Boston Marathon Bombing Trial, a Search for Justice and Closure CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS \u2014\u00a0Three short paragraphs - hand-written, in Russian, on lined, notebook paper - sat atop a stack of old newspapers next to the television in the newly vacant third floor apartment at 410 Norfolk Street.Federal Bureau of Investigation agents had done the first of two searches of the East Cambridge apartment, rented for more than a decade by an ethnic Chechen family, the Tsarnaevs.FILE - This April 15, 2013, photo shows medical workers aiding injured people at the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon following an explosion.Days earlier, on April 15, 2013, two pressure cookers, packed with nails and ball bearings, exploded near the Boston Marathon finish line, killing three, maiming scores and shattering the celebration of the world\u2019s oldest annual marathon.The Tsarnaevs\u2019 two sons had been implicated: Tamerlan, 26, had been killed during a police shoot-out. Dzhokhar, 19, was in police custody.A friend, who had known the Tsarnaev family for years and was very close to all of them, discovered the paper in the apartment and recognized the handwriting as Tamerlan\u2019s:\"They said: how many small armies had defeated larger armies by the will of Allah. The Prophet called to Allah with the words: give me the perseverance in all my undertakings and the resoluteness to follow the correct path. If Allah will give you support, then no one will defeat you. If he removes this support, then who will help you in place of nothing? Let the devout rely on Allah.\"A scrap of paper, featuring Quranic musings, written in Russian and shared with VOA, was found in the Cambridge apartment by a close family friend and identified by the friend as Tamerlan's handwriting.The writing, shared exclusively with VOA, is a glimpse into the mind of the man considered to be the mastermind of the Boston terrorist attack.Nearly 21 months later, the scars of the bombing - psychological and physical - are deep and raw in the Boston area as survivors, witnesses, Americans and Chechens, from Boston and Grozny, have groped to understand the motivations of the Tsarnaev brothers.VOA has retraced some of the key steps leading up to the bombing, interviewing members of the Chechen \u00e9migr\u00e9 community and others who had close dealings with the Tsarnaev family.The story that emerges is one of a troubled family buffeted by the challenges of adapting to American culture and by the undercurrents of war and radicalism wracking their ethnic homeland.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is seen in this law enforcement bulletin, distributed in the days after the April 15, 2013, bombing.The best hope, however, for understanding what led to April 15, 2013, lies with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, whose trial on 30 terrorism and related charges opens Monday in Boston\u2019s federal court just a few miles from the marathon\u2019s finish line.\u201cThey took the innocence from us, that they did take,\u201d said Jason Rosenberg, a Boston-area lawyer who represents a man once cared for by the Tsarnaev family. \u201cYou think you\u2019re immune from [terrorism], it only happens elsewhere.\u201d\u201cWe think: \u2018they can\u2019t be these beasts, but we all know that a human being \u2026 can be caring and loving to someone else and then be a horrendous person,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can be, and are, one and the same, the same person.\u201d\u2018Why did you do it, Tamerlan, why?\u2019A caring and loving person is what Tamerlan seemed like less than four weeks before the bombs sent panic through runners and spectators lining the few hundred yards along Boston\u2019s Boylston Street leading up to the finish line.Around March 20, Tamerlan, along with his American wife, Katherine, traveled to the outskirts of Manchester, New Hampshire, to visit another Chechen family who had fled the region in the early 2000s: Musa Khadzhimuradov, his wife Madina, and their two children.Among the two dozen or so Chechen families living in Boston and southern New Hampshire, it was common to mark holidays together, to attend one another\u2019s barbecues, to carry on traditions from back in Chechnya. Tamerlan had come, Khadzhimuradov said, to say goodbye to Khadzhimuradov\u2019s mother-in-law, who was returning to Chechnya.Khadzhimuradov, who formerly worked as a bodyguard to Chechen separatist leader Akhmed Zakayev, said he had been in touch with Tamerlan since 2006, when they met at a Chechen holiday celebration in Boston. At 755 Boylston St., just a few steps from the finish line of the Boston Marathon, there is little indication of the carnage of the 2013 bombing, except for a small makeshift memorial tied to a narrow tree.During the March visit, both Khadzhimuradov and his wife Madina recalled, Tamerlan played happily with his young daughter Zahara, and chatted with the Khadzhimuradovs\u2019 own daughter.\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about war or religion, nothing,\u201d Musa Khadzhimuradov told VOA. \u201cHe was happy. Maybe he had a double life or something, but he was playing with his child.\u201d\u201cThe way [Katherine] looked at him, she couldn't take her eyes of him,\u201d Madina said. \u201cTamerlan was chatting, playing with his daughter.\u201d \u201cI see him almost every night in my dreams,\u201d she said. \u201cHe looks just as always: very handsome and calm. I cry and I ask him: \u2018Why did you do it, Tamerlan, why?\u2019 And he answers: \u2018I didn't want to do it here.\u2019\u201dBut according to FBI affidavits, the grand jury indictment and other details made public in media reports, Tamerlan was plotting something destructive.On at least two occasions in the months prior to April 15, Tamerlan had visited a Manchester firing range just a few miles from the Khadzhimuradov apartment to practice shooting. On March 20, Dzhokhar, who was a student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, joined Tamerlan at the range.Carey McLoud, an owner and manager of the Manchester Firing Range Line, refused to answer VOA\u2019s questions about the Tsarnaev brothers.Tamerlan had also traveled to the New Hampshire coastal town of Seabrook to buy fireworks, and gather gunpowder to fuel the pressure cooker bombs. On February 6, at around 7:40 p.m., Tamerlan stopped at Phantom Fireworks and paid $199 cash for a package called \u201cLock and Load,\u201d and took advantage of a \u201cbuy-one-get-one-free deal.\u201d He left with 48 mortars and the equivalent of eight pounds of low explosive powder, according to prosecutors.On Feb. 6, 2013, Tamerlan Tsarnaev traveled to New Hampshire, to buy fireworks, as part of preparations to build pressure cooker bombs.\u201cHe asked \u2018what was the loudest, most powerful firework we had?\u201d store manager April Walton told VOA. \u201cIt\u2019s what 80 percent of our customers ask for.\u201dSometime around April 5, just 10 days before the bombings, Tamerlan went online and ordered electronic components that could be used in making bombs, according to the grand jury indictment. Those components were delivered by mail to the Norfolk Street apartment.In recent years, some members of the Tsarnaev family, including the boys\u2019 mother Zubeidat, had begun openly expressing their Muslim faith. They dressed in traditional conservative clothing and attended prayer services, mainly at the Islamic Society of Boston\u2019s Cambridge mosque four blocks from 410 Norfolk Street. Once a fashionable and flashy dresser, Zubeidat had taken to wearing headscarves, long skirts and long-sleeved dresses and shirts. She reportedly started wearing gloves constantly so as to avoid touching the hands of unrelated males, such as shop clerks or tollbooth workers. The Tsarnaev boys\u2019 sisters, Bella and Ailina, also began wearing headscarves.Outburst at the mosquePrior to November 2012, the Tsarnaevs didn\u2019t stand out among the hundreds who attended prayers regularly, said the Cambridge mosque\u2019s acting imam, Ismail Fenni.That month, a guest speaker gave a sermon about the importance of Muslims accepting public holidays like Thanksgiving. Tamerlan stood up and angrily interrupted the speaker, calling him wrong.Fenni said he and other elders spoke to Tamerlan and reminded him of the mosque rules of behavior and decorum. Tamerlan nodded and said he understood, Fenni recalled.Elders at the Cambridge mosque of the Islamic Society of Boston said the November 2012 outburst by Tamerlan Tsarnaev was the first time anyone really took note of him.Then in January 2013, at the prayer service before the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Tamerlan again stood up and interrupted the sermon, as the guest speaker discussed how Muslims should accept the civil rights leader.\u201cThere was nothing really for us to be worried about with him before his explosive outbursts,\u201d Fenni said. \u201cBefore then, he was just a face in the crowd.\u201dThat first outburst had occurred four months after Tamerlan returned from a trip to Russia\u2019s North Caucasus, where Chechnya is located.Between January and July 2012, Tamerlan spent some of his time in Makhachkala, the capital of the Dagestan region, working with his father Anzor, who had arrived in the region in April. Anzor was newly divorced from Zubeidat, according to the family friend, who asked not to be identified publicly while discussing the Tsarnaev\u2019s family dynamics.Like much of Russia's North Caucasus, Dagestan, shown here in red, has struggled with violence spilling over from neighboring Chechnya.The stated reason for Tamerlan\u2019s trip in January 2012, according to the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, was obtain a Russian passport: Tamerlan held a Kyrgyz passport, the result of his early childhood in Kyrgyzstan, where many Chechens lived after being expelled from their homeland by Stalin in the 1940s.But last year, Irina Gordienko, an investigative reporter for Novaya Gazeta, reported that Tamerlan didn\u2019t actually apply for a passport until the end of June, more than six months after arriving.Gordienko also reported Tamerlan had been in contact with two militants wanted by Russian security agencies. One, a Russian-Canadian named William Plotnikov, was killed by police on July 14, 2012. Within two days, Tamerlan left the region to fly back to the United States.\u201cPeople in Dagestan told me he dressed strangely, his behavior was unusual,\u201d Gordienko said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t very knowledgeable about Islam.\u201dWhere Tamerlan (L) saw some success as a boxer, Dzhokhar (R) captained his high school wrestling team.In the United States, Tamerlan had been a show-off from a young age, always seeking attention, the family friend told VOA. He loved to sing, to play violin and to dance. He was smart academically, but he never seemed focused, the friend said: he talked about being an accountant, but he took only a handful of classes at Bunker Hill Community College.Tamerlan was athletic, as well: he trained at a boxing club in Somerville, next door to Cambridge. His boxing career, nurtured by his father Anzor, hit a high point in February 2010 with a regional trophy. Then it petered out.\u201cHe didn\u2019t seem to know where he was going,\u201d the friend said.Over the years, Tamerlan pulled income from short-term jobs.In 2009, he worked as a driver for a Watertown-based elder care facility that catered to Russian immigrants. He also helped his mother with her work as a home health aide in the Newton home of Donald and Rosemary Larking.Donald Larking was an older man who became so close to Tamerlan that he attended prayer services at the Cambridge mosque, according to Rosenberg, Larking\u2019s lawyer. Larking also had constant discussions with Tamerlan about politics and espoused dark conspiracy theories about the attacks of September 11, 2001.Through Rosenberg, Donald Larking refused to be interviewed for this article.Pictured is Tamerlan (C) Tsarnaev, accompanied by his father Anzor (L), mother Zubeidat and uncle Muhamad Suleimanov (R), in this photo courtesy of the Suleimanova family.Tamerlan was interviewed by the FBI in 2011, at the request of the lead Russian security agency, the FSB, which had been monitoring Tamerlan\u2019s alleged interactions with radical groups. Chechnya had by then suffered through the second of two wars since 1994, and the turmoil had spawned a terrorist insurgency, influenced by Islamic extremists, that had affected the entire North Caucasus.According to an FBI statement, the Russians reported that Tamerlan \u201cwas a follower of radical Islam\u201d and \u201chad changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country\u2019s region to join unspecified underground groups.\u201dThe youngest TsarnaevDzhokhar, by contrast, was considered smart but quiet, always in his older siblings\u2019 shadow, according to friends and acquaintances.When the family moved to the Boston area, Dzhokhar, then 8, spent second grade at an elementary school in Needham, a Boston suburb. He lived with the family of a prominent Chechen doctor, Khassan Baiev.Baiev\u2019s daughter Maryam remembers Dzhokhar, who later called himself Jahar, as a happy boy who was good at math, who liked to rollerblade and bicycle around the neighborhood playground.As they grew older, however, she said she had few interactions with him, only occasionally by Facebook.\u201cI remember when I saw him on TV\u2026 I ran straight to my brother, and said, \u201cDid you see who was on TV?\u2019 He said \u201cYeah, I saw it,\u2019\u201d Baieva, 21, said. \u201cI was more upset. I felt bad for [Dzhokhar] and I felt bad for his parents, everything he put them through.Friends say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was smart and quiet, always in the shadow of his older siblings.\u201cI felt heartbroken, betrayed at the time. It was scary, because I didn\u2019t know how people were going to look at me after, what people were going to think of me afterward,\u201d she said.Unlike with Tamerlan - the trip to Russia, the mosque outburst, the initial FBI investigation - Dzhokhar\u2019s involvement in the attack was even more baffling. According to friends and acquaintances, he never elicited attention or worry prior to April 15, 2013: not from neighbors or friends, not from school, not from law enforcement.At Cambridge\u2019s Rindge and Latin high school, Dzhokhar was known as low-key, laid-back and friendly. He was captain of the public school\u2019s wrestling team, an honor student and the recipient of a small scholarship from the city of Cambridge.At the Dartmouth campus of the University of Massachusetts, Dzhokhar was known as a middling student and, according to The Boston Globe, an active dealer of marijuana.\u201cDzhokhar kept to himself, he was smart. He made his own choices,\u201d the family friend said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the center of attention; he was always off to the side.\u201d\u201cI never worried about Dzhokhar,\u201d the friend said.In the months immediately before the bombing, the Norfolk Street apartment was occupied only by Tamerlan, his wife and their daughter. Katherine worked as a home health aide. His parents were both living in Russia. His sisters had moved out.On the Dartmouth campus, according to prosecutors, there were indications that Dzhokhar was exploring violent acts. Sometime in the spring of 2013, Dzhokhar downloaded to his computer several books and pamphlets espousing radical Islamist ideas.One was a book that contained a passage by a well-known al-Qaida propagandist, Anwar al-Awlaki. Another was a copy of the summer 2010 issue of Inspire magazine, an English-language publication by al-Qaida\u2019s affiliate on the Arabian Peninsula.The issue contained detailed instructions about making a pressure cooker bomb using common materials in an article titled: \u201cHow to Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.\u201dFireworks found inside a backpack belonging to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are seen in a handout photo released by the FBI, May 2, 2013.After his arrest, investigators later found Dzhokhar\u2019s college dormitory room, his computer and a backpack containing fireworks that had been emptied of gunpowder.The night of April 15, Dzhokhar sent a friend\u2014 the son of a prominent Boston-area Chechen \u00e9migr\u00e9\u2014 a text message asking him if he was at the marathon and was OK.On April 18, as police widened their search for the alleged bombers, the brothers shot and killed a police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, according to the grand jury indictment. Hours later, as the manhunt began closing in, Dzhokhar sent another text message to a college classmate saying: \u201cIf you want u can go to my room and take what you want.\u201dIn the early hours of April 19, with Tamerlan dead and the suburban town of Watertown resembling a war zone, Dzhokhar, bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds, huddled in a boat parked in a backyard driveway.Inside the hull and on an overhead beam, he scrawled several messages that give some insight into his motivations, according to the indictment:\u201cThe U.S. Government is killing our innocent civilians; I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished; We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all; Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam.... stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.\u201dTrial as closureFor victims, for friends of the Tsarnaev family, for Chechen immigrants, for marathon runners, for arguably just about everyone in Massachusetts, the trial scheduled for Monday is likely to be a riveting spectacle.FILE - Demonstrators asserting that evidence in the Boston Marathon bombing was fabricated stand outside the federal courthouse ahead of a pre-trial conference for suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in Boston, Dec. 18, 2014.For some, it will be a chance at vengeance and punishment for a young man whose seeming potential crashed to a halt on April 15, 2013.For others, it will be a chance at learning something more about why a laid-back, average, 19-year-old college student decided to participate in a horrific attack on bystanders celebrating a beloved sporting event.\u201cI want to know why he did it. I want to know why he would go out of his way, what did he need when he already has everything,\u201d said Baieva, the childhood friend.On December 18, Dzhokhar appeared at the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse, on Boston\u2019s waterfront, his last appearance before the formal beginning of his trial. It was his first public appearance since July 2013, when, still visibly wounded from the manhunt, he told the court he entered a plea of not guilty.A courtroom sketch depicts Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, December 18, 2014.During the 30-minute appearance on December 18, Dzhokhar \u2013 sporting a shock of bushy hair and a thin beard \u2013 played nervously with his hands and smiled occasionally when talking with his lawyers.He stood when the judge addressed him directly, and he responded respectfully, saying \u201cyes, sir,\u201d and \u201cno, sir.\u201dFederal prosecutors have indicated they will seek the death penalty if Dzhokhar is convicted. His defense lawyers are expected to seek leniency from the jury, arguing that Dzhokhar was an accomplice, but decidedly under the sway of his older brother.Defense lawyers have also made a flurry of last-minute court filings, seeking to either delay the trial or move it out of state. A filing last Monday by Tsarnaev\u2019s lead lawyer, Judy Clarke, suggested that the defense was trying reach a deal with the prosecution: possibly a guilty plea in exchange for a life prison sentence.\u201cIf the government remains unwilling to relent in seeking death, and the case therefore must be tried, the defense is asking for nothing more than a trial that is fair,\u201d she wrote.A couple embraces at a memorial on Boylston Street to the bombing victims, April 21, 2013.The trial portends renewed grief not only for the victims of the bombing. For the refugees of the Chechen wars and oppression, who came to the New England over the past two decades, settling in the United States was a chance for them to rebuild a semblance of peace and prosperity. The Boston Marathon bombings shattered that dream.Upon reaching the United States, \u201cfor the first time in my life I felt that I, my kids, my family \u2013 that we are safe and happy here. I prayed for America every evening,\u201d said Madina Khadzhimuradova, the Tsarnaev family friend.\u201cNow it is all gone. I am living in fear again, just like in the old times in Chechnya. We spoke about moving somewhere else, but where can we go? There is no place for Chechens on this Earth.\u201d", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack Bombing <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing Trial

{"text": "HOUSTON \u2013 A 25-year-old man has been taken into custody for attempting to maliciously damage or destroy property receiving federal financial assistance, announced Acting U.S. Attorney Abe Martinez.A criminal complaint was filed in Houston federal court today charging Andrew Schneck, of Houston. He made his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Mary Milloy this morning, at which time he was temporarily ordered into custody upon the government\u2019s request pending a detention hearing set for Thursday, Aug. 24 at 2:00 p.m.According to the complaint, on the evening of Aug. 19, 2017, a Houston park ranger observed Schneck kneeling among the bushes in front of the General Dowling Monument located in Hermann Park in Houston. Schneck was allegedly holding two small boxes with various items inside to include what appeared to be duct tape and wires. After placing the boxes on the ground per the ranger\u2019s request, Schneck then allegedly took a drink from plastic bottle but immediately spit it on the ground. The ranger then noticed a timer and wires in the box and notified the Houston Police Department (HPD), according to the complaint.The clear liquid was field tested as was a white powdery substance found in a small, black aluminum tube which revealed they were most likely nitroglycerin and Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), respectively, according to the charges. HMTD is a high explosive organic compound used as an initiating, or primary explosive. Nitroglycerin has been used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of explosives. ln its pure form, nitroglycerin is a contact explosive, with physical shock causing it to explode, which degrades over time to even more unstable forms. Nitroglycerin is highly dangerous to transport or use. ln its undiluted form, it is one of the world's most powerful explosives.Authorities believe the items in Schneck\u2019s possession on Aug. 19 were capable to produce a viable explosive device, according to the charges.The complaint further alleges that Schneck conducts \u201cchemistry experiments\u201d at his Houston residence.The City of Houston receives federal financial assistance for maintenance of Hermann Park where the General Dowling Monument is located.If convicted, Schneck faces a minimum of five and up to 40 years in federal prison and a possible $250,000 maximum fine.The FBI and HPD are conducting the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorneys S. Mark McIntyre and Ted Imperato are prosecuting the case.A criminal complaint is a formal accusation of criminal conduct, not evidence.A defendant is presumed innocent unless convicted through due process of law.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain custody <extra_id_0> Detainee 25-year-old man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place HOUSTON <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain custody <extra_id_0> Jailer Mary Milloy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charging <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant Andrew Schneck <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Houston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict prosecuting <extra_id_0> Prosecutor S.

The FBI said in a statement that day that an FBI special agent, along with two Massachusetts State Police troopers and other law enforcement personnel, were interviewing Todashev in connection with the Boston Marathon bombing investigation, and that he was shot after he initiated a \"violent confrontation.\"According to the bureau, the special agent \"sustained non-life threatening injuries\" during the incident.After the incident, some U.S. media quoted unnamed U.S. officials as saying that Todashev, a 27-year-old mixed martial arts fighter, had lunged at the agent with a knife. On Wednesday, the Washington Post newspaper quoted an unnamed U.S. official as saying that Todashev had lunged at the agent but was unarmed.The FBI said Wednesday that is conducting a review of the incident to determine \"the reasonableness of the application of deadly force.\"The Council on American-Islamic relations, an advocacy group, said Wednesday it is asking the U.S. Department of Justice's civil rights division to investigate the incident.U.S. media also reported that while being questioned by the FBI, Todashev had implicated himself and Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev in a September 2011 triple slaying in a Boston suburb.Todashev formerly lived in the Boston area and trained in martial arts at a gym with Tsarnaev, a Boston resident. Both men were ethnic Chechen immigrants with U.S. resident status.Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police a few days after the Boston Marathon bombings. He was in a database of potential terrorism suspects and the United States had been warned by Russia that he might be an Islamic militant.His younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is in federal custody on charges he helped in the twin Boston Marathon blasts, which killed three people and injured 264 others.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim immigrant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack Shot  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shot <extra_id_0> Target immigrant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing trial  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shot <extra_id_0> Target Ibragim Todashev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shot <extra_id_0> Target he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain custody  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "By MARI YAMAGUCHI, Associated PressTOKYO (AP) \u2014 Japanese police have arrested a man who admitted to landing a drone with low-level radioactive sand on the roof of the prime minister's office to protest the government's nuclear energy policy, officials said Saturday.Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto, 40, turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan.The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices, the prime ministers' office has said. The infiltration at Japan's political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there.No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident.Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister's office. He has not been indicted and faces further questioning.Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government's nuclear energy policy.Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan's 48 reactors, which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami-triggered Fukushima plant disaster. Abe's administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible.The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium, levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment.The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima, where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai-ichi meltdowns, NHK said.The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities. Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial, service and entertainment use. At a meeting Friday, task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones.It is not clear exactly when the drone landed because workers at the office in central Tokyo rarely go up to the roof. An official taking new employees on a building tour reportedly spotted the drone.A blog with an anti-nuclear theme managed under the name \"Kantei (prime minister's office) Santa\" contained photos of a drone that looked like the one found Wednesday. In one entry, the anonymous writer said he drove from his hometown in Obama city in Fukui to Tokyo and flew the drone in the early hours of April 9, trying to have it land in the yard of the prime minister's office, but that he eventually lost track of the device.In the United States in January, a drone flown by an off-duty intelligence employee crashed on the White House grounds.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Jailer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize found <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Crash crashed  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak disaster  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Yamamoto <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer Police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime obstructing duties  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Instrument unmanned aerial devices <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Accused Boston Bomber Says Satisfied With Defense LawyersBOSTON \u2014\u00a0The Boston Marathon bombing suspect, in his first court appearance in more than a year, told a judge on Thursday that he was satisfied with his lawyers' preparations for the January start of his trial over the deadly 2013 attack.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, was dressed in a dark sweater and wore his hair shaggy for his appearance at U.S. District Court, where he will be tried on charges of killing three people and injuring more than 260 with two homemade bombs at the race's crowded finish line on April 15, 2013, as well as fatally shooting a university police officer three days later.The defendant, who had grown a light beard, appeared in a courtroom packed with victims, supporters and curious onlookers.Tsarnaev looked alert and healthy, showing no signs of the injuries suffered during a gunbattle with police on the night of April 18, 2013, that ended with the death of his brother, Tamerlan, also accused with playing a role in the attack. In his prior court appearance, in July 2013, Tsarnaev's left arm was in a cast and his face appeared swollen.U.S. District Judge George O'Toole asked Tsarnaev if he was satisfied with his defense attorneys in a series of questions intended to avoid any post-trial assertions that he was not provided a proper defense.\"Yes, your honor,\" Tsarnaev replied briefly to questions about whether his attorneys were keeping him abreast of court developments. He looked somewhat fidgety during the 25-minute hearing.O'Toole also said that many of the court documents filed under seal ahead of the trial will be made public after the jury is seated in January.'Stay strong'Tsarnaev faces the possibility of execution if convicted in a trial that is expected to run for three months. The court plans to weed through more than 1,000 people to find 12 jurors and six alternates to hear the case.At the hearing's conclusion, Elena Teyer, 45, whose son-in-law Ibragim Todashev was fatally shot by FBI agents in Florida during an interview about his friendship with Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the weeks after the bombing, shouted support to Tsarnaev in Russian.Outside court, she translated her words for reporters as \"Dzhokhar, we know you're innocent ... stay strong, son.\"A resident of Savannah, Georgia, Teyer said she had traveled to Boston specifically for the hearing.\"You know how hard it is when you have no one near you who is going to support you,\" Teyer said.Thursday's hearing is the final pre-trial conference in Tsarnaev's case. In the weeks leading up to the trial, prosecutors and defense attorneys are disputing a range of issues including how much they must disclose about the witnesses they plan to call.The Tsarnaev brothers had moved to the United States from Russia's restive Chechnya region a decade before the attack.Dzhokhar left a scrawled note inside the dry-docked boat where he was captured in Watertown, Massachusetts, a day after the shootout, indicating that the marathon attack had been motivated by U.S. military campaigns in Muslim countries.Tsarnaev's attorneys had asked that the trial be held outside Boston, contending that since hundreds of thousands of spectators attend the Boston Marathon, it would be all but impossible to find an impartial panel of people who had not been present the day of the attack or known someone who had been.O'Toole had previously denied that request, noting the court had recently seated juries in other high-profile cases, including the 2013 trial of former mob boss James \"Whitey\" Bulger, who was found guilty of racketeering and murder.On his way into court, one of the bombing's victims, Marc Fucarile, confronted a small group of protesters who asserted the evidence of the bombing was fabricated. Fucarile grabbed the prosthetic limb that replaced the right leg he lost in the bombing, saying he considered that proof enough.Asked about the incident, Fucarile said, \"They have a right to their opinion, same as anybody else.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing trial <extra_id_0> Defendant his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing tried <extra_id_0> Defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim 260 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die fatally <extra_id_0> Victim officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shooting <extra_id_0> Target officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die death <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing hearing <extra_id_0> Defendant He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shot <extra_id_0> Place Florida <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker agents <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Ibragim Todashev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die fatally <extra_id_0> Victim Ibragim Todashev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer agents <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Florida <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing hearing <extra_id_0> Defendant Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation moved <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination United States <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin Chechnya <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker Dzhokhar <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shootout <extra_id_0> Attacker Dzhokhar <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing trial <extra_id_0> Defendant James \"Whitey\" Bulger <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict found guilty <extra_id_0> Defendant James \"Whitey\" Bulger <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target Marc Fucarile <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Bogot\u00e1 car bomb: Colombia blames ELN rebels for deadly explosion Published duration 18 January 2019image copyright Reuters image caption The explosion outside a police academy shocked the Colombian capitalColombia has blamed the left-wing National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group for a car bomb attack that killed 21 people in the capital, Bogot\u00e1.Dozens more were injured in Thursday's blast after an explosives-laden vehicle broke into the grounds of a police academy before it detonated.The driver, who was also killed, has been identified as a 57-year-old man.President Ivan Duque put peace talks with the ELN on hold when he took power in 2018.Any restart to the negotiations is unlikely following the attack, the deadliest in the country in many years, correspondents say.What has the government said?The driver, named earlier as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, was a long-time ELN member and the group's top explosives expert, Defence Minister Guillermo Botero said.The suspect, known by his war alias \"El Mocho\" or \"Kiko\", had lost his right hand in an accident with an explosive and was based in the northern department of Arauca, from where he frequently crossed into Venezuela.\"This was an operation that has been planned for the past 10 months,\" Mr Botero said, adding that the guerrillas were the \"intellectual authors\" behind the driver's attack.A second man who had \"participated\" in the carrying out of the attack was arrested in Bogot\u00e1, Attorney General N\u00e9stor Humberto Mart\u00ednez said.image copyright EPA image caption A vigil was held in Bogot\u00e1 on Thursday to honour the victimsPresident Duque, who visited the site of the explosion on Thursday, described the attack as a \"crazy terrorist act\".\"We won't rest until we capture and bring to justice the terrorists involved,\" he said. \"Colombians have never yielded to terrorism, we have always defeated it. This will not be an exception.\"Colombia's High Commissioner for Peace Miguel Ceballos said there would be \"no space for dialogue with the ELN until they hand over all the kidnapped people and completely renounce their criminal acts.\"What do we know about the explosion?The grey Nissan Patrol entered the compound of the General Santander police academy in the south of Bogot\u00e1 where a promotion ceremony for cadets was being held.When the car was stopped by guards at a checkpoint, the driver accelerated and hit a wall, at which point the vehicle exploded.The vehicle was carrying 80kg (176lb) of the powerful explosive pentolite, which has been used in the past by Colombia's rebel guerrilla groups.The blast at 09:30 local time (14:30 GMT) shattered windows of nearby buildings.image copyright EPA image caption The explosion happened outside a school for police cadetsTwenty of the victims were police cadets aged between 17 and 22, Mr Botero said.At least 68 people were injured but the majority of those have since been discharged from hospital.Who are the ELN rebels?image copyright Getty Images image caption The group has been fighting the Colombian state for more than five decadesThe 2,000-strong guerrilla group was founded in 1964 to fight against Colombia's unequal distribution of land and riches, inspired by the Cuban revolution of 1959Over the decades, the group has attacked large landholders and multinational companies, and repeatedly blown up oil pipelinesTo finance itself it has resorted to extortion, kidnappings and drug traffickingIt has been strongest in rural areasWhat's the current situation in Colombia?Car bombs were not uncommon during the decades-long conflict between the Colombian government and left-wing rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc).But an explosion of a car bomb of this size is something that has not happened in a long time in Bogot\u00e1 and it took the city by surprise, BBC Mundo Colombia correspondent Boris Miranda reports.Colombia has significantly reduced bomb attacks and murders in recent years but the attack shows that it is a continuing fear for citizens, our correspondent adds.The Farc signed a peace agreement with the government in November 2016 and the group has since become a political party of the same name.The party's leader, Pastor Alape, condemned the attack. , calling it a \"provocation against the political way out of the conflict\".Peace talks between the smaller ELN and the previous government of President Juan Manuel Santos stalled, and President Duque, who takes a more hardline approach to the group, has not resumed them.Related Topics BogotaColombia", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Attacker rebels <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice car bomb: <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Target academy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place capital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice car bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker National Liberation Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place capital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer National Liberation Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim more <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injurer National Liberation Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target academy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle broke <extra_id_0> Instrument vehicle <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim driver <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer driver <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Place Bogot\u00e1 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict kidnapped  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation entered <extra_id_0> Vehicle Nissan Patrol <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination compound <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice pentolite <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle shattered <extra_id_0> Artifact windows <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle blown up <extra_id_0> Artifact pipelines <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice car bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Bogot\u00e1 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacked <extra_id_0> Attacker group <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target landholders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Pressure Cookers, Nails, BBs, and Bags: What We Know About the Boston BombsMore StoriesThe 140-Year-Old Dream of \u2018Government Without Taxation\u2019The Media Barely Covered One of the Worst Storms to Hit U.S. SoilFrance\u2019s Jews Look to Pittsburgh \u2018Across a Narrow Bridge\u2019There were only two bombsIn the hours following the explosions, an array of outlets \u2014 including the Associated Press,TheWall Street Journal, andThe New York Times\u2014 quoted anonymous law enforcement officials who said that police had discovered three and even five additional, unexploded devices around the Boston area.The reports emerged around the same time that, as first reported byThe Boston Globe, a bomb squad arranged and detonated a \"controlled explosion\" on Boylston Street, just east of the first two explosions, in order to destroy a cache of \"suspicious packages\" that officials had come across.A similar scene played out in the Boston suburb of Newton, where a bomb squad used a robot to investigate a suspicious object that turned to be a circuit board.Monday night, theJournalquoted law enforcement officials as saying there had been five devices, then updated its report to clarify that \"investigators now doubt the devices were bombs.\"But during Tuesday morning's press conference, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick announced that law enforcement agents had not in fact discovered any other bombs.\"It's important to clarify that two and only two explosive devices were found yesterday.Other parcels have been examined ... but there were no unexploded bombs,\" he told reporters.The bombs may have been based in pressure cookersA representative of Boston Children's Hospital said at Tuesday afternoon press briefing that children being treated for injuries \"had BBs and nails embedded in their bodies,\" which were presumably packed into or around the bombs in order to maximize damage.(Massachusetts Congressman Stephen Lynch, reiterating what doctors at multiple hospitals had reported at briefings of their own Monday night, told Yahoo News that many victims were struck by what appeared to be metal ball bearings.)The exact design of the bombs, of course, remains unclear.Citing an unnamed source familiar with the investigation, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday morning that investigators, upon recovering pieces of the exploded bombs, determined that they were made of 6-liter pressure cookers, which were packed with ball bearings and metal nails and stuffed into \"black duffel bags.\"(CNN described them as \"backpacks\".)On Tuesday afternoon this information was reported by multiple outlets speaking to sources with knowledge of the Boston investigation.This is what your average pressure cooker looks like:It's a metal container used to quickly cook food using trapped steam.(The cooker's contents are heated using a stove or a built-in heating element, in the case of electric models.)You can buy one pretty much anywhere.For these reasons it makes an attractive container (to terrible, violent people) for holding, transporting, and detonating explosive materials.\"Terrorists use pressure cookers as IED containers for 2 main reasons,\" Israeli journalist Elizabeth Tsurkov explained via Twitter on Tuesday afternoon.\"The pressure cooker increases the pressure of the explosion gasses [and] and because the metal casings becomes deadly fragmentation upon detonation.\"Indeed, there's a long history of terrorists employing pressure cookers abroad.On Tuesday morningTime's Michael Crowley surfaced a 2004 memo issued by the Department of Homeland Security, cataloging episodes in which Afghan terrorists used pressure cookers to fabricate explosive devices and detonated them in several countries throughout the 2000s.(Such contraptions are especially prevalent in contested regions of Pakistan.)American soil is no stranger to these contraptions, either.The foiled terrorist plot to detonate a bomb in Times Square on May 1, 2010, involved a pressure cooker.Indeed, nobody in law enforcement or government is making any public connections to any groups or places right now.A Saudi man reported to be a \"person of interest\" has been cleared as a suspect.As President Obama said at the White House Tuesday: \"What we don't yet know, however, is who carried out this attack, or why; whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic, or was the act of a malevolent individual.That's what we don't yet know.And clearly, we're at the beginning of our investigation.\"In a post expanding on the memo,Time's Crowley noted the ease of creating such an explosive device.\"The ability to make these bombs is hardly unique to al Qaeda and its sympathizers.Details on how to make a pressure cooker bomb can also be found on websites associated with anarchy and other forms of non-religious radicalism,\" he said, before linking to such a website.Other evidence suggests that the bombs were made with readily-available chemicals.New Scientistasked a bomb expert to study the footage of the explosion for clues of the bombs origin.Here's what the expert concluded: \"The Boston bombs ... produced an orange flash followed by white smoke.This suggests the bombs contained neither TNT nor RDX, which produce black smoke, but could have been a home-made chlorate-based device.\"Update, 5:04 p.m.:ABC News is reporting that one of the bombs used gunpowder to detonate.It's unclear how the bombs detonatedIn the same report detailing how the bombs were built, the Associated Press notes, \"law enforcement officials have some of the bomb components but [do] not yet know what was used to set off the explosives.\"In that vacuum of knowledge a number of rumors have appeared: 1) the bombs used a timer; 2) the bombs were activated remotely; 3) cell phone service was shut down in downtown Boston to avert other remotely-activated bombs; and 4) a mysterious roof-top figure captured in a single photo hassomethingto do with setting off the bomb.Rumor No.1 appears to be the strongest.After speaking to an official close to the investigation, CNN knocked down rumors (discussed below) that the bomb had been detonated using a cell phone-activated trigger, and reported that investigators in Boston think the bombs had timers attached to them instead.And, within minutes of CNN's report, theGlobereported that investigators had turned up a circuit board they believe was used to trigger the explosions; it was reportedly found near a spot where Gov.Patrick had been seated earlier in the day.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack explosions  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection discovered <extra_id_0> Observer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity devices <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> Place Boylston Street <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker squad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle destroy <extra_id_0> Place Boylston Street <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destroyer squad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact cache <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection investigate <extra_id_0> Instrument a robot <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity a circuit board <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Observer squad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize investigate <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject object <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifiedRole a circuit board <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Identifier squad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact announced <extra_id_0> Communicator Deval Patrick <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic any other bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place press conference <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact saying <extra_id_0> Topic devices <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection examined  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Intervention treated <extra_id_0> Patient children <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Treater Boston Children's Hospital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator representative <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic children <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Communicator Stephen Lynch <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Yahoo News <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic bearings <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble made <extra_id_0> Artifact the exploded bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components metal nails <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize cataloging <extra_id_0> Identifier Department of Homeland Security <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble fabricate <extra_id_0> Artifact explosive devices <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components pressure cookers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler terrorists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice them <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker terrorists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place countries <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonate <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Times Square <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker terrorist <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Acquit cleared <extra_id_0> Defendant man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator our <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble made <extra_id_0> Artifact the bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components readily-available chemicals <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime study <extra_id_0> Investigator expert <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonate <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice the bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble built <extra_id_0> Artifact the bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack trigger <extra_id_0> Instrument circuit board <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Venezuela crisis: Maduro to raise fuel prices to combat smugglingVenezuela\u2019s heavily subsidised domestic fuel prices should rise to international levels to avoid billions of dollars in annual losses as a result of smuggling, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has said in a televised address.\"Gasoline must be sold at an international price to stop smuggling to Colombia and the Caribbean,\" the president said.Like most oil-producing countries, Venezuela has for decades subsidised fuel as a benefit to consumers.But its fuel prices have remained nearly flat for years despite hyperinflation that the International Monetary Fund has projected would reach 1 million per cent this year.That means that for the price of a cup of coffee, a driver can fill the tank of a small SUV nearly 9,000 times.Recently, the average price of a coffee with milk was 2.2m bolivars, or about 50 cents, local media has reported.Smugglers do brisk business reselling fuel in neighbouring countries.Quick guideWhy is Venezuela in crisis?Show Hide Under the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who ushered in Venezuela\u2019s socialist revolution in 1999, a new constitution and numerous elections placed nearly all government institutions under the control of the ruling Socialist party.This concentration of power was aided by a feuding opposition which carried out ineffectual campaigns and electoral boycotts.After Ch\u00e1vez died of cancer in 2013, he was succeeded by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro who is even less tolerant of dissent.Growing political authoritarianism has coincided with greater state dominance over the economy.But expropriations, price controls and mismanagement have led to a 40% contraction of the economy in the past five years.Oil accounts for 96% of Venezuela\u2019s export income but many foreign companies have been driven out and production has dropped to a 30-year low.The resulting fiscal crisis has prompted the government to print more money, which has led to hyperinflation and a collapse of the currency.It also means that the government can\u2019t import enough food and medicine to meet demand.Maduro has rejected economic reforms out of loyalty to socialism and because many government officials are allegedly getting rich off the economic distortions \u2013 through exchange rate scams and by selling scarce food on the black market.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Maduro said the government would still provide direct subsidies to citizens holding the \"fatherland card\", a state-issued identification card that the government uses to provide bonuses and track use of social services.He said the subsidy was only available to those who registered their cars in a vehicle census being conducted by the state.Venezuela has dirt-cheap fuel, so why is driving nearly impossible?Read moreOn Friday, the UN said that more than half a million Venezuelans had crossed into Ecuador this year as part of one of the largest mass migrations in Latin American history.About 547,000 citizens have entered Ecuador since January \u2013 mostly through its northern border with Colombia \u2013 to escape rampant crime and political violence, a collapsing economy and severe shortages of food and medicines.More than 1 million Venezuelans have also crossed into Colombia since the exodus began in 2015.Others have fanned out across Latin American and Caribbean nations including Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Trindad and Tobago.Tens of thousands have hiked into Brazil down a remote Amazon road known as the Hunger Highway.",

{"text": "A Canadian academic was charged in Paris on Saturday over the deadly 1980 bombing of a Paris synagogue, the man\u2019s lawyer said.University professor Hassan Diab, a Canadian of Lebanese descent, appeared before an anti-terror judge just hours after arriving from Montreal after losing a six-year legal battle against extradition.The October 3, 1980, bombing of a synagogue on rue Copernic in Paris killed four people and marked the first fatal attack against the French Jewish community since the Nazi occupation in World War II.Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign UpThe 60-year-old sociologist had been fighting his extradition to avoid what he said would be an unfair prosecution in France for a crime he insists he did not commit.Diab\u2019s extradition came after Canada\u2019s supreme court refused on Thursday to hear his final plea to halt the procedure.Diab was arrested at his home in an Ottawa suburb in November 2008 at the request of French authorities who alleged he was a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.The extremist group pioneered armed jetliner hijackings in the 1960s and was believed to be behind a string of deadly attacks in Europe, including the Paris bombing.Canada\u2019s justice minister signed an order in April 2012 to send Diab to France after a Canadian court approved his extradition, despite its concerns that the French case was \u201cweak\u201d.Diab has said he has \u201cabsolutely no connection whatsoever to the terrible 1980 attack,\u201d while his legal team argued he should not be extradited because a conviction in Canada would be unlikely.Synagogue packedThat attack on the synagogue happened on a Friday evening, the eve of the Jewish sabbath when it was packed with some 300 worshipers.Ten kilograms of explosives packed in the saddlebags of a parked motorcycle were detonated and the ensuing blast killed three Frenchmen and a young Israeli woman and wounded some 40 people.Police first focused on the far right as possible perpetrators of the bombing before turning their attention to extremist groups in the Middle East, but made no headway in the case for years.The probe was relaunched in October 2007 to gain information from the United States on Diab, who had spent several years in the country.Diab became a Canadian citizen in 2006 and is now the father of a nearly two-year-old girl with his common-law wife.He has claimed that he was studying in Beirut at the time of the bombing and has said that he had been confused with someone with the same name.Diab\u2019s lawyers in Canada have mainly sought to discredit what they called \u201cfatally flawed\u201d handwriting analysis of a Paris hotel slip that French authorities say was signed in the same false identity that was also presented to purchase the motorcycle used in the bombing.Diab\u2019s lawyers have said that the fingerprint evidence does not match Diab\u2019s and that the person who signed the hotel slip was described by witnesses as being middle-aged, whereas Diab would have been 26 at the time.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant academic <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Paris <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target synagogue <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Paris <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target synagogue <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place rue Copernic <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target community <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing appeared <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt judge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant Hassan Diab <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation arriving <extra_id_0> Origin Montreal <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Hassan Diab <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Diab <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Place Europe <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Paris <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target synagogue <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim woman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime probe <extra_id_0> Defendant Diab <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell purchase <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity motorcycle <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "VERY FEW of those who were around in Belfast on Bloody Friday even after a lapse of 30 years, can forget the scenes they witnessed then - and fewer still can want to remember.This was terror in the raw unleashed on a still unhardened population. As the bombs went off in sequence, now in one part of the city, now in another, rumour took over, naked fear and anxiety. Warnings were given, perhaps deliberately erroneous, maybe not, maybe hoax calls, perhaps not but the effect was the same.Groups of office and shop workers ordered to evacuate threatened premises, gathered at street corners only to run in shrieking droves as a bomb went off nearer the place in which they had sought refuge.The smell of fear exceeded only by the whiff of powder, enveloping smoke, the jangle of ambulances and fire engines and screaming police cars, and office alarms crying heedlessly to the air, the smell of smoke and dust, sound of shattering glass, the cries of fear and horror, the stench of burning timber, burning rubber, burning metal, burning flesh.And most of all the horror of Oxford Street Bus Station where commuter deaths brought the savagery of the city to surrounding towns and villages as people waited for those who had gone to work or to shop to return.Nine did not and many others returned home broken and injured and not only physically. The final horror of the television news reels of body parts being shovelled into polythene bags by those whose insufficiently recognised task it was to clear up the carnage.If it has taken the Provisional IRA 30 years to face up to the enormity of what they did on that day and on many other days, and to apologise for the hurt caused, it has not come a day too soon. Or indeed too late either, in what we are now seeing the beginning of a real effort to promote the process of healing, to bind up the wounds and to enable the community to face the future together.Acceptance of responsibility is always a good starting point. Regrets for hurts done is the next stage. Forgiveness for wounds received perhaps the next, and acceptance that no side has a monoply of victimhood, or virtue or validity is perhaps the closure.The IRA statement starts as an apology for the hurts inflicted on innocent victims on a particular occasion. These will not be additionally reassured by being classified as non-competence, but it goes much further than that. Bloody Friday is as good a symbol as any of the universality of suffering at the futility of violence.There are those who will carp at the exclusion of those implicitly typified as combatants - presumably policemen, soldiers and prison officers and others unfortunate enough to be designated as legitimate targets. Many of these too, even allowing the doubtful premise of legitimacy were shot down in ambush, in cold blood in the domestic situation, but so, republicans will argue were many of their victims too.The statement does go on to recognise the hurt of all victims, combatant and non-combatant, and it would be ungenerous not to recognise the impulse for reconciliation which lies behind these words - or the effort that has been required to bring it about. Thirty years ago even innocent victims were dismissed as the unfortunate casualties of war, in the wrong place at the wrong time. Things have moved a long way when all can be seen as victims, when the hurts of all can be recognised.When the IRA first announce a ceasefire, they were castigated for not including some phrase of regret, some words of apology. This was further highlighted when some weeks later Gusty Spence announced the loyalist ceasefire in terms which included an apology for hurts inflicted which was quite moving at the time. Subsequent loyalist activity has not eradicated the value of that statement in that context. Neither should current disturbances or uncertainties be used to denigrate the IRA statement.Some elements of unionism will remain implacable no matter what republicans say or do. Others will demand additional deeds rather than words. Others still will argue a lack of moral equivalency, that illegality can never be legitimised or terrorism condoned. The important thing now is how that statement and the sentiments behind it, which should be recognised as genuine and not merely a rhetorical or political ploy are accepted by those who have been on the receiving end by the relatives of victims and survivors, many of whom have been horribly mutilated.In general, such people have proved to be much more willing to forgive than those who have suffered by proxy. Those who experienced Bloody Friday in Belfast may welcome the statement more than those who viewed it from afar. In any case, to recall the events shows how far society has moved on towards peace since then.For the long suffering populace of Northern Ireland, like the mothers in O'Casey's play \"on either side of a scales of sorrow, weighed down by the bodies of our suffering sons\", this is a significant and a very welcome statement.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack went off <extra_id_0> Instrument bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "France Lyon: Police arrest suspects in parcel bomb attack Published duration 27 May 2019image copyright AFP image caption The device, full of screws, nuts and bolts, went off in Lyon city centre last weekFrench police have arrested four people after a suspected parcel bomb exploded in Lyon last week, injuring 13 people.One of those arrested, a 24-year-old man, is the suspected bomber, prosecutors say. Another man and a woman were also reportedly detained.Police had been hunting for a man seen cycling near the scene of the blast wearing a balaclava and rucksack.Anti-terrorist prosecutors are leading the investigation, co-ordinating with Lyon police and France's internal security service, the DGSI.What do we know about the suspects?French media report that one suspect is an IT student of Algerian nationality. A source told news agency Reuters that police arrested him in Lyon after tailing him in the street.

{"text": "On 4 December 1971, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group, detonated a bomb at McGurk's Bar in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The pub was frequented by Irish Catholics/nationalists. The explosion caused the building to collapse, killing fifteen Catholic civilians\u2014including two children\u2014and wounding seventeen more. It was the deadliest attack in Belfast during the Troubles.Despite evidence to the contrary, the British security forces asserted that a bomb had exploded prematurely while being handled by Irish Republican Army (IRA) members inside the pub, implying that the victims themselves were partly to blame. A report later found that the police (Royal Ulster Constabulary) were biased in favour of this view, and that this hindered their investigation. The victims' relatives allege that the security forces deliberately spread disinformation to discredit the IRA. In 1977, UVF member Robert Campbell was sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in the bombing and served fifteen years.The bombing sparked a series of tit-for-tat bombings and shootings by loyalists and republicans, which contributed to making 1972 the bloodiest year of the conflict.==Background==McGurk's (also called the Tramore Bar) was a two-storey public house on the corner of North Queen Street and Great George's Street, in the New Lodge area to the north of Belfast city centre. This was a mainly Irish nationalist and Catholic neighbourhood, and the pub's regular customers were from the community. The pub was owned by Patrick and Philomena McGurk, who lived on the upper floor with their four children.The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) was formed in Belfast in 1966, declaring \"war\" on the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Until 1971, however, its actions were few and it \"scarcely existed in an organisational sense\". The British Army was deployed in Northern Ireland following the August 1969 riots, which are usually seen as the start of the Troubles. In December 1969 the IRA split into two factions: the 'Official' IRA and Provisional IRA. Both launched armed campaigns against the British Army, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the government of Northern Ireland.During 1971, the violence gradually worsened. There were daily bombings and shootings by republicans, loyalists and the security forces. During the first two weeks of December, there were about 70 bombings and about 30 people were killed. On 2 December, three republican prisoners escaped from Crumlin Road prison, not far from McGurk's. Security was tightened and there was a heavy RUC and British Army presence in the area over the next two days. Eyewitnesses asserted that the checkpoints around McGurk's were removed just an hour before the attack.==Bombing==On the evening of Saturday 4 December 1971, a four-man UVF team met in the Shankill area of Belfast and were ordered to bomb a pub on North Queen Street. According to the only convicted bomber\u2014Robert Campbell\u2014they were told not to return until the job was done. Campbell said that their target had not been McGurk's, but another pub nearby. It is believed this was a pub called The Gem, which was allegedly linked to the Official IRA. The  bomb was disguised as a brown parcel, which they placed in a car and drove to their target. Campbell says they stopped near The Gem at about 7:30pm, but could not gain access to it because there were security guards outside. After waiting for almost an hour, they drove a short distance to McGurk's. At about 8:45pm, one of them placed the bomb in the porch entrance on Great George's Street and rushed back to the car. It exploded just moments after they drove off. Campbell implied that McGurk's had been chosen only because it was \"the nearest Catholic pub\".The blast caused the building to collapse. Bystanders immediately rushed to free the dead and wounded from the rubble. Firefighters, paramedics, police and soldiers were quickly on the scene. Fifteen Catholic civilians had been killed\u2014including two children\u2014and a further seventeen wounded. The rescue effort lasted many hours.Within two hours of the blast, a sectarian clash had erupted nearby at the New Lodge\u2013Tiger's Bay interface. The British Army and RUC moved in and a gun battle developed. A British Army officer, Major Jeremy Snow, was shot by the IRA on New Lodge Road and died of his wounds on 8 December. Two RUC officers and five civilians were also wounded by gunfire. Eventually, five companies of troops were sent into the district and they searched almost 50 houses.Meanwhile, the UVF team had driven to a nearby pickup point where they dumped their car. They walked to the area of St Anne's Cathedral and were picked up by another. They were driven back to the Shankill and met the man who had ordered the attack in an Orange Hall, telling him that \"the job has been done\".Among those killed were Philomena and Maria McGurk, wife and 14-year-old daughter of the pub owner Patrick McGurk. Patrick and his three sons were seriously injured. Shortly after the attack, McGurk appeared on television calling for no retaliation: \"It doesn't matter who planted the bomb. What's done can't be undone. I've been trying to keep bitterness out of it.\"==Investigation=====Responsibility===After the bombing, the media reported various theories about who was responsible. The main theories were:*that it had been planted by loyalists;*that it had exploded prematurely while being prepared by IRA members inside the pub;*that it had exploded prematurely while \"in transit\", an IRA member having left it in the pub to be collected by another IRA member; and*that it had been planted as part of a feud between the Provisional IRA and Official IRA.The security forces promoted the idea that it was an IRA bomb which exploded prematurely (an \"own goal\"). Survivors and relatives denied this. They said the pub was not associated with the IRA and there had been no suspicious people or activity in the pub that night. An Intelligence Corps document from December 1971 also said that the pub was not known to have IRA associations. On 6 December, both wings of the IRA condemned the attack, denied responsibility and blamed the UVF and security forces.====Claims of responsibility====That same day, several newspapers received telephone calls from someone claiming to be a spokesman for the \"Empire Loyalists\". Their statement to the Belfast Telegraph was:We [the Empire Loyalists] accept responsibility for the destruction of McGurk's pub. We placed 30lb of new explosives outside the pub because we had proved beyond doubt that meetings of IRA Provisionals and Officials were held there. The \"Empire Loyalists\" had made only one other claim of responsibility; for bombing a community centre on 12 November. The RUC, however, had no intelligence about such a group; suggesting that it may have been a covername.On Tuesday 7 December, a youth claimed to have seen a man acting oddly at a phone kiosk the night before. He said the man was wearing a jacket with a UVF badge on it. The youth claimed to have checked the kiosk after the man left and found a torn bit of paper. When put together, it included the lines:We the Empire Loyalists wish to state that we did not destroy McGurk's public house as an act of retaliation ... Furthermore we do not require the forensic experts of the Army to cover up for us ... We shall not issue any further statements until we exterminate another rebel stronghold.In the days following the bombing, the RUC received a letter signed by \"Chief of Staff, UVF\" claiming that the UVF bombed the pub because an IRA meeting was due to take place there. It said that two UVF members entered the pub, had a drink and asked the barman to mind a package while they \"ran an errand\". Witnesses told the RUC, however, that there had been no strangers in the pub and that nobody had left a package. Three other unsigned letters were sent to the RUC, claiming it was an IRA bomb \"in transit\" and that two IRA members were killed.====Location of the bomb====For the RUC, the location of the bomb (whether it exploded inside or outside) became the key to finding who was responsible. However, investigators (both RUC and British Army) were unsure and gave conflicting opinions.RUC duty officers' reports were made daily. Their purpose was to brief the Chief Constable and others at HQ about events that had happened that day. The reports were also made available to the British Army's General Officer Commanding for Northern Ireland. The 4\u20135 December 1971 report said of the bombing: \"Just before the explosion a man entered the licensed premises and left down a suitcase, presumably to be picked up by a known member of the IRA. The bomb was intended for use on other premises. Before the 'pick-up' was made the bomb exploded\". The origin of this information could not be established.On 6 December, however, the RUC took a witness statement from an 8-year-old boy. He said that a car had stopped outside the pub with four men inside and \"a wee Union Jack stuck in the back window\". He said one left a package in the Great George's Street doorway and ran back to the car, which sped off just moments before the package exploded. A man and a woman backed up his story, although they did not witness as much as the boy. Despite this, the security forces and the government stood behind the \"own goal\" theory. A British Intelligence Corps document covering the period 8\u201315 December said: \"It has been confirmed that it was a [Provisional IRA] bomb which was destined for another target, but exploded prematurely.\" A Ministry of Defence (MOD) document dated 14 December said that this \"should be publicised\". On 23 December, the British Army sent a letter (signed by a lieutenant colonel) to people living in north Belfast. It said that when the IRA in the area is destroyed, \"we can look forward to \u2026 a period in which you will not lose your friends in a repetition of the [IRA's] accident in the McGurk\u2019s bar.\"===Arrest and conviction of Robert Campbell===In March 1976, the RUC received intelligence that linked UVF member Robert Campbell and four others to the McGurk's bombing. Campbell was arrested on 27 July 1977 and held at Castlereagh RUC base. He was interviewed seven times during 27 and 28 July. He admitted his part in the bombing but refused to name the others. Campbell's story matches that given by the young boy witness.On 29 July 1977, Campbell was charged with the 15 murders and 17 attempted murders. On 6 September 1978 he pleaded guilty to all charges and received life imprisonment with \"a recommendation to serve no less than 20 years\", in part for a separate conviction for the murder of a Protestant delivery driver in 1976. He is the only person to have been charged for the bombing. He eventually served fifteen years in prison and was released on 9 September 1993.===Collusion claims and Police Ombudsman's investigation===The victims' relatives campaigned for an independent investigation of the bombing as they believed that the RUC's investigation was flawed from the outset. Moreover, they wished to disprove the claim that the victims were IRA members killed by their own bomb (the \"own goal\" theory). Even after Campbell's conviction, the \"own goal\" theory remained officially unchallenged. Relatives argued that this theory was promoted as part of a \"government policy to avoid publicly acknowledging the loyalist campaign of violence\". Another argument is that it was promoted to undermine the IRA's support and stir tension between the two IRA factions.Relatives also asked how the bombers were able to plant the bomb and flee despite the usually heavy security presence. Some alleged that the security forces helped the bombers by removing checkpoints. The 2009 book Killing For Britain, written by former UVF member 'John Black', claimed that the British undercover unit known as the Military Reaction Force or Military Reconnaissance Force (MRF) organized the bombing and helped the bombers get in and out of the area. The bombers' original target, The Gem, was associated with the Official IRA. It is claimed that the MRF ordered the team to bomb The Gem, with the intention of blaming it on the Provisional IRA. The plan was allegedly to start a feud between the two IRA factions, which would both divert them from their campaign against British forces and drain their support. However, as The Gem had security outside, they bombed the nearest 'Catholic pub'.On 21 February 2011, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland published a report about the bombing and the RUC's investigation of it. The report said that there is no evidence that the RUC helped the UVF bombers. However, it found that the RUC investigation was biased in favour of the view that the IRA was responsible. It failed to give enough thought to the possible involvement of loyalists, and this bias hindered the investigation. The report also found that RUC gave \"selective\" and \"misleading\" briefings to the government and media, which furthered the idea that it was an IRA bomb. The Ombudsman has not found an explanation why successive Chief Constables have not addressed this mistake. Ombudsman Al Hutchinson said: \"Inconsistent police briefings, some of which inferred that victims of the bombing were culpable in the atrocity, caused the bereaved families great distress, which has continued for many years\".On 6 December 2012, Scottish Labour MP Michael Connarty - whose uncle was killed in the bombing - claimed in Westminster that then-Prime Minister Edward Heath \"may have been involved\" in wrongfully blaming the IRA and spreading the story. Connarty also urged David Cameron, Prime Minister at the time, to apologise to victims and launch a full investigation.==Remembrance==In 2001 a memorial was unveiled on the site of McGurk's Bar to mark the 30th anniversary of the bombing. Relatives of the victims called for an investigation into allegations that British forces helped the bombers. Almost a thousand people attended a service at St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street, after which fifteen wreaths, one for each victim, were carried by relatives leading a silent candlelit procession to a new memorial at Great George's Street.Patrick McGurk died on 15 December 2007, having forgiven those responsible for the explosion and having prayed for the men who carried out the attack.==See

{"text": "A man accused of trying to ignite explosives aboard an American Airlines jet could be one of many suicide recruits from London, according to the chairman of a Brixton mosque where the suspect worshipped.Abdul Haqq Baker, speaking outside the mosque in south London, told reporters Wednesday he believes the suspect, identified on his passport as Richard Reid, could not have acted alone and that more will try to succeed where he failed.\"I think now they've seen that this particular plan was foiled, the others I fear, are going to be more successful and more extreme in what they do,\" Baker said.\"I really personally believe he was a tester,\" he said. \"They wanted to see how far he would get and then act thereafter.\"Baker said Reid, 28, was known by the name Abdel Rahim when he joined the mosque in 1998, at about the same time as Zacarias Moussaoui, who has been indicted in the U.S. on conspiracy charges related to the Sept. 11 hijackings.Moussaoui is a French citizen accused of being trained as the \"20th hijacker\" for the attacks on the Pentagon and New York's World Trade Center.Baker says Reid, believed to be of Anglo-Jamaican heritage, had converted to Islam while serving time in jail for minor offences and attended the mosque for two years.Reid is accused of trying to detonate C-4 plastic explosives hidden in his shoes on a flight from Paris to Miami last Saturday. A flight attendant said she noticed the smell of smoke, then saw a man trying to light one of his shoes with a match.The plane, with nearly 200 people on board, was diverted to Boston's Logan International Airport, escorted by two F-15 fighter jets.Reid is being held at the Plymouth correctional facility in Massachusetts.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Defendant man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack ignite <extra_id_0> Attacker man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die suicide <extra_id_0> Victim one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict indicted <extra_id_0> Prosecutor who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place U.S. <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Prosecutor Moussaoui <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain jail <extra_id_0> Place jail <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee Reid <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Prosecutor Reid <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack light <extra_id_0> Attacker man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain held <extra_id_0> Place Massachusetts <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee Reid <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Kyrgyzstan National Pleads Not Guilty to Hampering Boston Bomb ProbeBOSTON \u2014\u00a0A citizen of Kyrgyzstan on Wednesday pleaded not guilty to charges of lying to federal investigators about his ties to the two ethnic Chechen men accused of carrying out the Boston Marathon bombing.Khairullozhon Matanov, 23, faces one criminal count of destroying records and three counts of lying to officials in a terrorism investigation. He is not charged with taking part in the April 15, 2013, attack, which killed three people and injured more than 260.Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler ordered Matanov held until trial, after his attorney noted that it was unclear how the man would support himself after losing his job as a taxi driver following his arrest.She left open the option for his lawyer to seek his pretrial release if he were to find living arrangements.Matanov's involvementAn FBI agent who had worked on his case acknowledged under cross-examination by defense attorney Edward Hayden that Matanov, who lived in Quincy, Massachusetts, had shown up at a local police station the morning of April 19, 2013, while a manhunt was under way for suspected bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, to identify the man, but that the FBI had not interviewed him until the next day.Hayden noted that charging papers pointed out that Matanov had dinner with the suspected bombers, Dzhokhar and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the night of the attack and discussed the incident. Hayden asked FBI Special Agent Timothy McElroy undercross-examination if there was any evidence that Matanov at the time had suspected the Tsarnaevs of being involved in the attack.\"There's nothing in here, no,\" said McElroy, consulting court papers.Pending chargesProsecutors said Matanov deleted searches related to the attacks from his computer and tried to dispose of cell phones he described as illegal after the FBI released photos of the suspected bombers on April 18, 2013.Matanov was brought into court on Wednesday handcuffed and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit. His attorney said he entered the United States in 2010 on a student visa and was later granted political asylum due to ethnic clashes in his native Kyrgyzstan.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, is being held in a federal prison west of Boston awaiting trial on charges that carry the threat of execution if he is convicted.

{"text": "Oklahoma City Bombing Documentary Examines Growth of American ExtremismWASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0The Oklahoma City bombing nearly 22 years ago was an act of domestic terror by U.S. military veteran Timothy McVeigh and his accomplice, Terry Nichols. The bombing destroyed one third of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, killing 168 people and injuring 680 others. In his documentary, Oklahoma City, filmmaker Barak Goodman revisits the bombing as the first major domestic terrorist attack in the United States on April 19, 1995.It was the number of civilians killed - especially the 15 children, four of them infants, crushed inside the building's day care center - that made this terrorist attack by a massive fertilizer bomb so heinous for many Americans. Many films have recounted the story, but Goodman\u2019s documentary treats the Oklahoma City bombing as a springboard to examine the roots of America's ultra-right militia and to analyze the makeup of homegrown American terrorism.History of suspicion\u201cIt goes all the way back to the founding of the Republic,\u201d the filmmaker told VOA. \"The Republic was founded on the suspicion of government.\" Goodman says many of these extreme separatists believe in white supremacy and in unregulated freedom to keep and bear arms so that they can protect themselves from outsiders and the government.In the documentary, former militia member Kerry Noble explains the ideology. \u201cThe government is an enemy of the people, and in this war it\u2019s an all or nothing. We\u2019re either gonna win as the white race or we\u2019re gonna lose.\u201d FILE - In this April 21, 1995 file photo, Timothy McVeigh is led out of the Noble County Courthouse by state and federal law enforcement officials in Perry, Oklahoma, after being identified as a suspect in the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal building. McVeigh was eventually convicted of the bombing and executed.Oklahoma City points to two events in the late 20th century that bolstered separatist ideologies: The Ruby Ridge incident on August 21, 1992, and the Waco siege in Waco, Texas, between February 28 and April 19, 1993. In both cases, federal and local government agents clashed with American separatists. The deadly incidents were fueled by the authorities' demand to search the premises for illegal firearms.The Waco siege was particularly deadly. The compound belonged to a group known as the Branch Davidians, led by David Koresh. When federal authorities sent in armed agents and armored vehicles to end the standoff, a fire engulfed the compound, killing 82 people, including David Koresh. Sixty-two of the victims were women and children.Birth of an extremistTimothy McVeigh, a Gulf War veteran disillusioned by the government during his tour in Iraq, was among those who went to witness the siege. According to the documentary, McVeigh was radicalized by those events and by an extremist publication called The Turner Diaries.\u201cIt\u2019s a Talisman for the far right, even to this day, but especially back in the '90s and '80s it was the \u2018Bible\u2019 of this movement,\u201d says Goodman. \u201cIt\u2019s a novel about a small group of \u2018patriots,\u2019 \u2018white patriots\u2019 who retake the government from the Jews and blacks who have infiltrated it, essentially. It\u2019s a racist creed and as I said, it is very poorly done. Intriguingly though, it describes the bombing of the FBI, the culmination of the novel, and it really lays out a recipe on how to build a bomb like this.\"That bomb is very similar to the one McVeigh used in Oklahoma City.\"McVeigh was deeply, deeply influenced by this book,\" Goodman adds. \"He sold it in gun shows, he quoted it, when he was arrested he had several pages of it in a folder beside him in a car. And it wasn\u2019t just McVeigh, it was all through this movement. People were really exorcised, impassioned, inflamed by this novel.\"FILE - In this May 5, 1995, photo, search and rescue personnel attend a memorial service in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma, destroyed by a fertilizer bomb in what is considered the first major domestic terrorist attack in the U.S.The documentary shows McVeigh obsessed with his guns and with the idea that the government was going to take them away. The film also points out that his exposure to the war in Iraq accelerated his feeling of mistrust of the U.S. government. \u201cThe way he put it made it sound he was emphatic towards the dead Iraqi soldiers that he killed. I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case,\u201d says Barak Goodman. Instead, says the filmmaker, it was McVeigh\u2019s mistrust of the U.S. government, how it had blundered into Iraq and his idea of the U.S. government as a bully, and McVeigh, says Goodman, hated bullies. The Ruby Ridge and Waco stand-offs reinforced that idea in his mind.Homegrown extremismAccording to the documentary, there are 500 militia organizations in the U.S. today. Goodman believes they are as radicalized as ever. \u201cSome of them have gotten rid of their camouflage outfits and put on suits and ties, but really the rhetoric has been virtually the same for 100 years or more. \u2018It\u2019s a whites-only country, it should be a whites-only country, the federal government is in the hands of Jews, blacks, it\u2019s a conspiracy.'\u201dGoodman says it is a misconception to believe that this is a movement of white poor disenfranchised people. Certainly, he says, many are, but there also many professionals feeling a loss of entitlement, a loss of privilege and power. The filmmaker stresses that these people operate outside political parties and share a deep mistrust of the Washington political establishment.But Goodman cautions these extremists are not de facto terrorists. He says it takes a confluence of opportunity and a warped personality, often a lone individual, to commit a terrorist act of a scale such as the Oklahoma City bombing.\u201cMcVeigh was a shock to most people in the FBI. It would be less of a shock today. But it\u2019s very hard to prevent these things. One of the takeaways from our film and audiences who have seen it have been amazed at how really easy it was to do this. It cost about $6000, it was one guy, reading some literature,\u201d says the filmmaker.FILE - A member of a white supremacy group gives a fascist salute during a gathering in West Allis, Wisconsin, Sept. 3, 2011. \"The number of hate groups in the United States rose for a second year in a row in 2016 as the radical right was energized by the candidacy of Donald Trump,\u201d according to the Southern Law Poverty Center, a U.S. rights group.Goodman says in a politically polarized America, the possibility for future domestic terrorist attacks is high. \u201cIf you talk to people from the Southern Law Poverty Center, which tracks these groups, they are pounding on the wall, they are ringing the bell, they are saying, \u2018This is an ongoing threat, it\u2019s threat level midnight, it's rising, it's whatever the highest color is on the chart,'\u201d he says.The SPLC reports, \u201cthe number of hate groups in the United States rose for a second year in a row in 2016 as the radical right was energized by the candidacy of Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cThe most dramatic growth,\u201d it states, \u201cwas the near-tripling of anti-Muslim hate groups \u2013 from 34 in 2015 to 101 last year.\u201d Also, a wave of bomb threats and vandalism has rattled Jewish institutions around the country, but especially in the South. \u201cRight now, minorities feel particularly threatened,\u201d says the Oklahoma City filmmaker.\u201cThere is a very big difference between even hard gun rights activists and terrorists. I want to make that clear,\u201d says Goodman. \u201cI would take issue with the idea that they have infiltrated the administration. But it is a little galling to see the really mono focus on terrorists from abroad, terrorists influenced by ideas from abroad, whatever those ideas might be, and not on any real discussion about home-grown terrorism which has always been with us and which is not going away and which is actually -- if you look at the numbers of the incidents -- rivaling or exceeding those by that other group,\u201d he adds.Goodman hopes his film, Oklahoma City, will call attention to this rising threat and contribute to the conversation on the inherent dangers of domestic terrorism.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker Terry Nichols <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Oklahoma City <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant McVeigh <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim David Koresh <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble build <extra_id_0> Artifact bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target Oklahoma City <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Report says CIA attacks led to civilian deaths and casualties and says US protocols are 'hurdle to transparency'A United Nations investigation has so far identified 33 drone strikes around the world that have resulted in civilian casualties and may have violated international humanitarian law.The report by the UN's special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, Ben Emmerson QC, calls on the US to declassify information about operations co-ordinated by the CIA and clarify its positon on the legality of unmanned aerial attacks.Published ahead of a debate on the use of remotely piloted aircraft, at the UN general assembly in New York next Friday, the 22-page document examines incidents in Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Pakistan and Gaza.It has been published to coincide with a related report released earlier on Thursday by Professor Christof Heyns, the UN's special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, which warned that the technology was being misused as a form of \"global policing\".Emmerson, who travelled to Islamabad for his investigation, said the Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs has records of as many as 330 drone strikes in the country's north-western tribal areas since 2004. Up to 2,200 people have been killed \u2013 of whom at least 400 were civilians \u2013 according to the Pakistan government.In Yemen, Emmerson's report says that as many as 58 civilians are thought to have been killed in attacks by UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). \"While the fact that civilians have been killed or injured does not necessarily point to a violation of international humanitarian law, it undoubtedly raises issues of accountability and transparency,\" the study notes.Reaper UAVs, used by the RAF in Afghanistan, have a range of 3,700 miles (5,900 km), a maximum airspeed of 250 knots and can ascend to 15,300 metres (50,000 feet), the document explains. Their missions can last up to 18 hours.The Reaper carries three cameras as well as laser-guided bombs. Three communication networks relay information between the RAF ground station in the UK and the UAV: \"a secure internet-based chat function, a secure radio routed via satellite and a secure telephone system\".\"The United Kingdom has reported only one civilian casualty incident, in which four civilians were killed and two civilians injured in a remotely piloted aircraft strike by the Royal Air Force in Afghanistan on 25 March 2011,\" Emmerson's report states. An RAF inquiry found that \"the actions of the [ground] crew had been in accordance with the applicable rules of engagement\".The special rapporteur said that he was informed that during RAF operations in Afghanistan, targeting intelligence is \"thoroughly scrubbed\" to ensure accuracy before authorisation to proceed is given. RAF strikes, he points out, are accountable in the UK through the Ministry of Defence and parliament.By contrast, Emmerson criticises the CIA's involvement in US drone strikes for creating \"an almost insurmountable obstacle to transparency\". He adds: \"One consequence is that the United States has to date failed to reveal its own data on the level of civilian casualties inflicted through the use of remotely piloted aircraft in classified operations conducted in Pakistan and elsewhere.\"Recent prounouncments from Barack Obama, however, have stressed that \"before any strike is taken, there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured\".Emmerson acknowledges that: \"If used in strict compliance with the principles of international humanitarian law, remotely piloted aircraft are capable of reducing the risk of civilian casualties in armed conflict by significantly improving the situational awareness of military commanders.\" But, he cautions, there is \"no clear international consensus\" on the laws controlling the deployment of drone strikes.The special rapporteur concludes by urging: \"the United States to further clarify its position on the legal and factual issues \u2026 to declassify, to the maximum extent possible, information relevant to its lethal extraterritorial counter-terrorism operations; and to release its own data on the level of civilian casualties inflicted through the use of remotely piloted aircraft, together with information on the evaluation methodology used.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker CIA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target civilian <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths <extra_id_0> Victim civilian <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer CIA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strikes <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place country <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injurer Royal Air Force <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument aircraft <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strike <extra_id_0> Instrument aircraft <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Afghanistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Royal Air Force <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

One blew up outside the Old Bailey criminal court, while the other went off outside Scotland Yard.Strict securityThe 10-week trial at Winchester Crown Court has seen some of the strictest security precautions in British legal history.The court was heavily guarded throughout, and as the verdict was delivered, four rows of plain-clothes detectives sat bethind the dock and at least 15 prison officers surrounded the defendants. All doors to the court were bolted.First, the jury returned a not-guilty verdict on Roisin McNearney, a known IRA activist who is believed to have helped the police identify the other conspirators.As her verdict was handed down, the other defendants began to hum the Dead March from Saul, and one threw a coin at her, shouting \"Take your blood money with you\" as she left the dock in tears.A number of threats have already been made to members of her family and she has said she is unlikely ever to be able to return to her native Belfast.'Murderous enterprises'As the eight guilty defendants were led to the cells below the court several gave clenched fist salutes to relatives and friends in the public gallery, who shouted \"Keep your chins up\" and \"All the best\".The judge then addressed Miss McNearney, saying, \"You have learned a bitter lesson and I hope it has taught you and others like you not to dabble in murderous enterprises.\"He then ordered that she be given police protection.The two women defendants, Dolours and Marian Price, were believed to have played the most important role in the conspiracy, along with a third defendant, Hugh Feeney.

Flackes and Elliott (1994) Northern Ireland: A Political Directory 1968-1993 Many watching the television news reports were reduced to tears by horrifying pictures of firemen and rescue workers ... scraping up the remains of human beings into plastic bags ... Bardon (1992) A History of Ulster 'Bloody Friday' is the name given to the events that occurred in Belfast on Friday 21 July 1972. During the afternoon of 'Bloody Friday' the Irish Republican Army (IRA) planted and exploded 22 bombs which, in the space of 75 minutes, killed 9 people and seriously injured approximately 130 others. In addition to the bombs there were numerous hoax warnings about other explosive devices which added to the chaos in the streets that afternoon. Many people believe these hoax warnings were deliberately used to reduce the effectiveness of the security forces in dealing with the real bombs. As the quotes above make clear, the killing and maiming had a profound impact on most people in Northern Ireland. 'Bloody Friday' also led to the decision by the British Government to implement 'Operation Motorman' when, in the biggest British military operation since the 1956 Suez crisis, the British Army entered and ended the 'no-go' areas of Belfast and Derry.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> Instrument bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Irish Republican Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Boston Marathon Bomber\u2019s Life Hangs in the Balance BOSTON \u2014\u00a0He\u2019s a charmer. He\u2019s a slacker. He\u2019s bright. He\u2019s a victim of culture shock, a broken family and a domineering older brother. He\u2019s a murderer. He\u2019s a terrorist.That\u2019s the picture presented in recent days of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as his defense lawyers neared the end of their effort to save their client\u2019s life. As early as Monday, the defense may rest their case and put their faith in the 12-person jury, which will decide whether he should die or live.Tsarnaev, 21, was convicted last month of 30 terrorism and other related charges for his role in the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. U.S. law requires that the jury must return a unanimous decision in order to execute a person, and it is that chance \u2013 that one juror will decide against the death penalty \u2013 where Tsarnaev\u2019s lawyers are placing their hopes.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, shown in January 2007, holding the daughter of his grade school teacherThree people died in the attack, including an 8-year-old boy, and more than 260 were wounded. Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, killed a police officer several days later just prior to a car chase and shootout that left Tamerlan dead.Penalty PhaseThe two-part trial entered the \u201cpenalty\u201d phase April 21, as prosecutors sought to paint Tsarnaev as a willing accomplice in the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001.Defense lawyers portrayed their client as a malleable participant, under the sway of Tamerlan, who they said was the mastermind and leader.\u201cThe whole goal of the defense is \u2026 to make the jury see the defendant as a vulnerable human being,\u201d said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center.\u201cThe jury doesn\u2019t have to like him,\u201d he said. \u201cThe jury doesn\u2019t have to want to have him over to their house for dinner. They just have to decide that putting him away in a dark hole for the rest of his life is an acceptable punishment.\u201dAs with the previous phase, the courtroom has been whipsawed by testimony, by turns infuriating, wrenching, maddening or saddening.Prosecutors stunned spectators and jurors in their opening arguments for the death penalty by juxtaposing photographs: of the youngest victim, 8-year-old Martin Richard, and that of Tsarnaev, making an obscene gesture to a video camera in the prison cell where he\u2019s being held.\u201cThis is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged,\u201d federal prosecutor Nadine Pellegrini told jurors.Courtroom TearsOn Monday, less than two weeks later, the courtroom filled with sobbing, when Tsarnaev\u2019s aunt, Patimat Suleimanova, flown from Russia, wracked with tears, tried to speak about her nephew whom she hadn\u2019t seen in more than a decade.During the weeks that the trial has been ongoing, Tsarnaev, who spent his childhood shuttling between Russia and Kyrgyzstan and then his formative years in a three-bedroom, third-floor apartment in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has been largely impassive and at times appearing bored.On Monday, after listening to his aunt, he himself broke down for the first time, rubbing his eyes with his fists and openly weeping.Not long after, as he was being led from the courtroom during a break, he blew a kiss to a cousin who was in attendance.South Boston resident Joe Kebartas, holding a sign reading \"Death Penalty is Murder,\" demonstrates outside the federal courthouse where Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been convicted on all 30 counts, April 8, 2015.More than 40 witnesses appeared during the penalty phase, including some of Tsarnaev\u2019s former school teachers and college friends, some crying openly. During her appeareance in court on April 29, one former teacher, Becki Norris, smiled at Tsarnaev, and he returned the smile.Later, she posted a photograph on Facebook of 12-year-old Tsarnaev holding her newborn daughter.\u201cWhen you care deeply for someone, that doesn't stop even if they do unfathomably horrible things. We humans are really good at holding two irreconcilable ideas in our psyches at the same time. Yes, he did the unforgivable. And yes, I still love him. And \u2013 this one is hard to fathom, I know \u2013 he still needs love,\u201d Norris wrote on her Facebook page.Death penalty decisionThe decision by the Obama administration to seek the death penalty for Tsarnaev has been controversial. Massachusetts state law does not allow for capital punishment, but Tsarnaev is being tried in federal court.Support for the death penalty in the state has never been strong, and public opinion polls taken by Boston-area media in the months prior to and during the trial have shown dwindling enthusiasm.On the eve of the final phase, the Boston Globe published a front-page letter from Martin Richard\u2019s family, in which they called for sentencing Tsarnaev to life in prison.This undated photo provided by Bill Richard shows his son, Martin Richard, who was among the at least three people killed in the explosions at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, Apr. 15, 2013.\u201cAs long as the defendant is in the spotlight, we have no choice but to live a story told on his terms, not ours,\u201d the family wrote. \u201cThe minute the defendant fades from our newspapers and TV screens is the minute we begin the process of rebuilding our lives and our family.\u201dAt the beginning of Tsarnaev\u2019s trial, his defense, led by renowned lawyer Judy Clarke, conceded his guilt, in what appeared to be a strategy focused more on saving his life. \u201cThis is the theory: that no person is only the worse thing they\u2019ve done in their life,\u201d said Quin Denvir, a former federal defender who worked with Clarke in gaining a life prison sentence for Theodore Kaczynski, the \u201cUnabomber,\u201d in a federal trial in 1998.\u201cIt\u2019s all part of letting the jury seeing the person as a human being, not just the perpetrator of a crime, but as a fully developed human being, with strengths and weaknesses,\u201d Denvir said.In addition to calling relatives and experts on Chechnya\u2019s tortured history, lawyers have called witnesses to argue that the prison where Tsarnaev would live out the rest of his life \u2013 the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Colorado \u2013 would be harsh and unforgiving.It is \u201ca mechanism to cut off an inmate\u2019s communications with the outside world,\u201d defense witness Mark Bezy testified on Wednesday.Tsarnaev\u2019s parents, Anzor and Zubeidat, were not called to testify. Both now live in Dagestan, the Russian region bordering Chechnya, and have not returned the United States since just after Tsarnaev\u2019s initial court appearance in 2013.Russian Hunger For NewsWith the Tsarnaev family\u2019s ties to Russia and the North Caucasus, there\u2019s been intense interest in the trial for many Russians, according to Alexei Venediktov, the editor-in-chief of Ekho Moskvy, an influential, independent radio station and Web site in Moscow.The proceedings, however, have received virtually no coverage in the Russian news media, nearly all of which is state-controlled. Venediktov told VOA that\u2019s probably because of growing concern from the Kremlin about stability in the long-troubled North Caucasus.\u201cThis process carries an unpleasant association, I think, for the leadership, in particular, of the Russian Federation, and therefore, I think, it\u2019s possible there\u2019s been embargo on news,\u201d he said. He also said support is growing in Russia to bring back the death penalty, and were the Boston jury to sentence him to death, it would have a significant impact on the Russian debate.\u201cI think the jury\u2019s verdict will be actively discussed in Russia if it ends up being the death penalty,\u201d he said.Tlisova reported from Boston; Eckel reported from Washington.

{"text": "An unknown virus may be spreading within Venezuela's Aragua state, medical officials report; however, the state's governor denies these allegations and accuses the official of lying.According to the Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional, the crisis arose in Central Hospital of Maracay where personnel were seen with mouth covers. Social media began rumors about various deaths within the hospital caused by bacteria similar to Neisseria meningitides.Angel Sarmiento, president of Aragua Medical School, announced eight people died of the yet unidentified disease. He said it was not Ebola, meningitis, dengue or chikungunya. He added that the victims were four children and four adults.The symptoms exhibited by the dead were spots on the body that turned to boils, high fever, massive hemorrhaging stemming from smaller hemorrhagic incidents, and multi-organ failure. The disease took around 72 hours to run its course.\"We don't know what we are confronting,\" Sarmiento said. \"We don't know if it's a virus or bacteria. How can we heal what we don't know?\"However, there may not be any disease to battle.

Tarek el Aissami said, \"I need to start by categorically denying the existence of some virus or bacteria on the premises of the Maracay Central Hospital that is putting the lives of patients at risk.\"Aragua's governor refuted Sarmiento's claim and called them a \"terrorist matrix that has a basic purpose, which is to create alarm, anguish in Aragua's population.\" He added that the deceased died of different causes, including an old man dying of diabetes and one of the children from leukemia.\"What you are is a criminal, who, irresponsibly using your status as a doctor, launched this campaign without finding out the facts, without investigating, and in these last few hours you've caused terrible anguish among the people of Aragua,\" el Aissami said about Sarmiento.The governor called on the Attorney General's office to investigate Sarmiento.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak virus <extra_id_0> Place state <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak bacteria <extra_id_0> Place hospital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak disease <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak virus <extra_id_0> Place the Maracay Central Hospital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim patients <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak bacteria <extra_id_0> Place the Maracay Central Hospital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim patients <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Scotland Yard are searching for a group of about five people, including a \"baby faced\" teenage youth, in the wake of two bomb explosions at King's Cross and Euston stations in London yesterday.Thirteen people were injured, three seriously, in the lunchtime explosions. The attacks are the latest in the Provisional IRA's three week old bombing campaign in England carried out by small active service units. At King's Cross a 15 to 17-year-old youth ran on to Platform 8 and threw a brown paper parcel into the entrance of the old booking hall at 12.24 p.m.The youth described by one of the five injured in the blast as baby faced and \"too young to shave\" sprinted out of the station seconds before the 3lb. bomb exploded. A coded call gave police a three-minute warning of a second bomb at Euston which exploded at 1.16 p.m. in the Railbar injuring eight people.Scotland Yard said that the call, telephoned to the Press Association news agency was in the name of the same group which has given warnings about previous bombs in London. The caller, a man with an Irish accent, is believed to be responsible for all the warnings.Commander Robert Huntley, who is heading the investigation said the name of the group used in the calls enabled Scotland Yard to distinguish the real warnings from the hundreds of hoax calls. He would not disclose the code name but denied that the code name \"Persuaders\" - given to Birmingham police before the blast on Sunday night - had been used in London.The Commander attacked the hoax callers who were responsible yesterday for the closure of most main line stations in London while bomb searches were made.Charing Cross Station was evacuated after an anonymous bomb warning to the Sloane telephone exchange at 4.55p.m. After a search, passengers were allowed back at 5.30.Euston was also cleared after receiving a rush-hour threat. Other searches were made after calls to Paddington, Waterloo and London Bridge.Mr Huntley said yesterday's explosions, which followed the weekend attack on Victoria Station, appeared to be similar to the previous bombings and that the devices were \"typical of IRA manufacture.\" A piece of battery and part of a clock spring were found amid the debris at Euston, suggesting the charge had been timed and primed in exactly the same manner as other bombs.The police believe that the IRA are using at least two small squads of bombers operating in London and the Midlands who are almost constantly on the move living in cheap hotels and boarding houses.Asked about previous claims from Commander Ernest Bond that the bombers were close to arrest, Mr Huntley said he did not think the statement had been over-optimistic. Certain evidence had been compiled on those thought to be responsible. He indicated that the gang members were interchangeable and might not even live in this country.Commander Huntley said the bombers' tactics were now clear. The three-minute warning at Euston indicated that the aim of the bomb was \"to cause injury and destruction\" in a crowded station. He appealed for the public not to leave parcels, luggage, and containers unattended in public places but to keep property with them at all times.All those seriously injured yesterday were at Kings Cross - a Chinese couple from Hull and a London man. Mr Anthony Barber, the Chancellor, was sitting in a train which had just arrived when the bomb exploded. He joined the crowd helping the injured and asked if there was anything he could do.Although Scotland Yard are privately convinced that the recent wave of bombings has been the work of the Provisional IRA, police have failed to discover signs of a widespread IRA organisation in England.It seems likely that the bombing teams are either recruited in England, from outside the ranks of republican organisations and sympathisers, or are briefed and armed in Ireland and sent over individually.A small and changing group of four to six people operating alone in the London area without recourse to or contact with known republicans living here has largely neutralised the intelligence gathered by the Special Branch on Irish militants.The fact that the Provisionals' leadership has not yet claimed responsibility from Dublin has little bearing on its involvement. The salient point is that the Provos have always been quick to disclaim responsibility for incidents in which they are not involved and no such disclaimer has been issued.While it might well be true that extremists in England have taken advantage of the confusion created by the bombings to plant their own explosive devices, informed sources in Dublin consider it certain that the present campaign was both planned and approved by the IRA Army Council in Dublin.The explosions have almost certainly gone beyond what the Provisionals had originally intended but they see no reason to help Scotland Yard by claiming or disclaiming responsibility.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack explosions <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target stations <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim three <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim five <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Railbar <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim those <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injury  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle destruction  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact contact <extra_id_0> Participant republicans <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "A wave of attacks across Iraq on Monday killed 107 people in the country's deadliest day in more than two years after al-Qaida warned it would mount new attacks and sought to retake territory.Officials said at least 214 people were wounded in 27 different attacks launched in 18 cities, shattering a relative calm which had held in the lead-up to the start on Saturday of the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.In Monday's deadliest attack -- a string of roadside bombs and a car bomb followed by a suicide attack targeting emergency responders in the town of Taji -- at least 42 people were killed and 40 wounded, according to two medical officials.\"I heard explosions in the distance so I left my house and I saw a car outside,\" said 40-year-old Taji resident Abu Mohammed, who added that police inspectors concluded the vehicle was a car bomb.\"We asked the neighbors to leave their houses, but when they were leaving, the bomb went off.\"Abu Mohammed said he witnessed the deaths of an elderly woman carrying a newborn baby and of the policeman who had first concluded the car was packed with explosives.An Agence France Presse reporter at the scene said a row of houses were completely destroyed, and residents were rummaging through the rubble in search of victims and their belongings.In Baghdad, meanwhile, a car bomb outside a government office responsible for producing identity papers in the Shiite bastion of Sadr City killed at least 12 people and wounded 22 others, security and medical officials said.\"This attack is a terrible crime against humanity, because they did it during Ramadan, while people are fasting,\" said one elderly witness who declined to be identified.An AFP journalist said eight nearby cars were badly burned and many of the victims of the 9:30 am (0630 GMT) attack could not be identified because their papers were inside the offices that were targeted.Two other explosions in the Baghdad neighborhoods of Husseiniyah and Yarmouk killed at least four people and left 24 others wounded, while a car bomb in the town of Tarmiyah, just north of Baghdad, hurt nine people, officials said.Checkpoint shootings and bomb blasts in restive ethnically-mixed Diyala province killed 11 people and left 40 others wounded, security officials and doctor Ahmed Ibrahim from the main hospital in provincial capital Baquba said.Insurgents also launched attacks on a military base near the town of Dhuluiyah, killing at least 15 Iraqi soldiers and leaving two others wounded, according to two security officials.Two other attacks in the same province -- a shooting at a checkpoint and a car bomb near a Shiite mosque -- left three people dead and six wounded, officials said.Nine bomb blasts, some of them minutes apart, meanwhile killed seven people and wounded 29 in Kirkuk city and the eponymous province's towns of Dibis and Tuz Khurmatu.Three different attacks -- a car bomb, a roadside blast and a shooting -- in the main northern city of Mosul and the nearby town of Baaj left nine people dead and seven wounded, according to Iraqi army First Lieutenant Waad Mohammed and police Lieutenant Mohammed al-Juburi.A roadside bomb at a market in the center of the town of Diwaniyah, south of Baghdad, killed three people and left 25 hurt, provincial health chief Adnan Turki said.In the western town of Heet, a car bomb exploded near an army patrol, killing one soldier and wounding 10 others, according to an Iraqi army captain and doctor Abdulwahab al-Shammari from the town hospital.The attacks came a day after a spate of bombings across Iraq killed at least 17 people and wounded nearly 100 others. Monday's toll was the highest since May 10, 2010, when 110 people were killed.The latest violence comes after the country suffered a spike in unrest in June when at least 282 people were killed, according to an AFP tally based on figures supplied by officials and medics, although government figures said 131 Iraqis died.Although those figures are markedly lower than during the peak of Iraq's communal bloodshed from 2006 to 2008, attacks remain common.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Monday's attacks, but al-Qaida's front group in Iraq has warned in recent days that it seeks to retake territory in the country.The Islamic State of Iraq warned in an audio message posted on various jihadist forums that it would begin targeting judges and prosecutors, and appealed for the help of Sunni tribes in its quest to recapture territory it once held.\"We are starting a new stage,\" said the voice on the message, purportedly that of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has been leader of the Islamic State of Iraq since May 2010.\"The first priority in this is releasing Muslim prisoners everywhere, and chasing and eliminating judges and investigators and their guards.\"It was not possible to verify whether the voice was that of Baghdadi.The speaker added: \"On the occasion of the beginning of the return of the state to the areas that we left, I urge you to carry out more efforts, and send your sons with the mujahedeen to defend your religion and obey God.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker al-Qaida <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Iraq <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer al-Qaida <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Taji <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target responders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Taji <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths <extra_id_0> Victim policeman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack destroyed <extra_id_0> Target victims <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Place Baghdad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosions <extra_id_0> Place Tarmiyah <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts <extra_id_0> Place Diyala province <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target military base <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Insurgents <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Dhuluiyah <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer Insurgents <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim Insurgents <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shooting <extra_id_0> Instrument bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place mosque <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Kirkuk city <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Baaj <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place town <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Heet <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target soldier <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Place Iraq <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

There was no indication that the brothers communicated directly with Awlaki.On Thursday, Boston officials said a funeral home picked up the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev on behalf of his family. There were no details on where the body was taken or his exact cause of death.Tamerlan was killed in a police shootout three days after he and his younger brother allegedly set off two bombs at the Boston Marathon finish line. The blasts killed three and wounded 264. Dzhokhar was captured and is in a prison hospital.Kazakhstan says it is cooperating with U.S. authorities after two Kazakh nationals were arrested for allegedly obstructing the bombing investigation. The Foreign Ministry statement says Kazakhstan condemns any form of terrorism.U.S. federal agents arrested the two Kazakhs and an American for allegedly helping Dzhokhar Tsarnaev destroy evidence.

He said forensic investigation was still underway. The target of what police have said was an attack plotted by Driver was unclear.Driver, who also used the alias Harun Abdurahman, was arrested last year for openly supporting Islamic State on social media, but was never charged with a crime. Islamic State militants control parts of Iraq and Syria and they have supporters and sympathizers around the world who have carried out attacks on civilians in several countries.In February, Driver was placed on a peace bond, a court order that restricted his movements. It required he stay away from social media and computers and not have contact with Islamic State or similar groups.The RCMP has said officers sought out Driver on Aug. 10 after a tip from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation that morning, which included a \u201cmartyrdom video.\u201dCabana said police identified Driver from the video in part through his choice of balaclava.The incident called into question Canada\u2019s capabilities to combat extremism and increased calls for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to abandon his plan to scale back a 2015 law that gave increased powers to police and intelligence agents.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack detonate <extra_id_0> Attacker who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast <extra_id_0> Target taxi <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Strathroy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim Aaron Driver <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Victim driver <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker Driver <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target target <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Harun Abdurahman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant Harun Abdurahman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place countries <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

The officer searching the homes recovered items including three gas tanks, a pressure cooker, fertilizer, jihadist literature and handwritten notes on the recipes for bomb making, court papers say.Velentzas had been \"obsessed with pressure cookers since the Boston Marathon attacks in 2013'' and made jokes alluding to explosives after receiving one as a gift, according to a criminal complaint citing one of the secret recordings made by the undercover agent who befriended the pair.Fighting 'homegrown violent extremists'The women\u2019s arrests show U.S. authorities \u201care committed to doing everything in our ability to detect, disrupt and deter attacks by homegrown violent extremists,'' U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement. \u201cAs alleged, the defendants in this case carefully studied how to construct an explosive device to launch an attack on the homeland.''In this courtroom sketch, Muhanad Mahmoud Al Farekh, with beard, appears in federal court in New York April 2, 2015.

Texas-born Muhanad Mahmoud Al Farekh appeared Thursday in Brooklyn federal court and was held without bail.The women also were held without bail after a brief court appearance, where they spoke only to say they understood the charges against them. Velentzas, 28, wore a hijab and a dark dress, and Siddiqui, 31, had on a green T-shirt with a long-sleeved black shirt underneath and a dark long skirt.Siddiqui\u2019s lawyer, Thomas Dunn, said his client \"will enter a plea of not guilty, if and when there is an indictment.\"Velentzas' attorney had no comment.The complaint cites a poem written by Siddiqui that appeared in a magazine published by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. It declared there is \"no excuse to sit back and wait for the skies [to] rain martyrdom,'' investigators wrote in court papers.Velentzas called al-Qaida\u2019s founder, the late Osama bin Laden, one of her heroes, and said she and Siddiqui were \"citizens of the Islamic State,\" investigators said.Research methodsAccording to the complaint, the women \"researched and acquired some of the components of a car bomb, like the one used in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; a fertilizer bomb, like the one used in the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City; and a pressure cooker bomb, like the one used in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing,'' authorities wrote.After two New York City police officers were gunned down in a patrol car in December, Velentzas told the undercover officer that the deaths showed it was easy to kill a police officer, the complaint said.After the undercover officer mentioned that 25,000 officers had turned out for the first of the funerals for the two officers, Velentzas \u201ccomplimented'' the officer for coming up with an attractive target and considered whether the other funeral was an appropriate target, it added.The complaints suggests that authorities decided to make the arrests after Siddiqui came into \u201cpossession of multiple propane gas tanks, as well as instructions for how to transform propane tanks into explosive devices,\u201d and told the undercover she was \u201cdisinclined\u201d to talk about her plans.\u201cIt is very, very important to note: There was never any imminent threat to our fellow New Yorkers,'' Mayor Bill de Blasio said when asked about the case. The plot, he added, \"was undercut before it could turn into something dangerous.''Siddiqui\u2019s neighbors said she and her brother lived in the basement of a red-brick three floor house owned by their parents, who didn't live there.\u201cShe was quiet, and I never thought she could do this,'' said Mohammad Shahidul Haque, a retired hospital lab tech.Other plot reportedly hatched in Canada As for Al Farekh, he and two other co-conspirators were students at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, in 2007 when authorities say they started watching al-Qaida propaganda and hatching a plan to become martyrs abroad, an FBI agent wrote in a January complaint.Al Farekh and the two others flew to Karachi, Pakistan, on round-trip tickets in March 2007 after selling their belongings, disconnecting their phones and buying mountain boots that authorities say are commonly worn by al-Qaida fighters in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the complaint says.His lawyer did not comment.President Barack Obama has nominated Lynch to become the nation\u2019s next attorney general, though her confirmation has been held up in the U.S. Senate.

{"text": "With 24 hours to go until the biggest election in years, here\u2019s an oddity: the Government doesn\u2019t care who you vote for. Just as long as you vote.After the opposition\u2019s do-it-yourself election, the bar is high for chavismo to prove they still represent \u201cthe majority\u201d. But how do you convince people against their hearts? Proposals from each of the candidates, presented three times a day on national radio and TV cadenas, are more a joke than a real constitutional project.Chavismo\u2019s done what it can to give Sunday\u2019s election the look-and-feel of a major political event, but they\u2019ve come up short in both substance and style. Superficially, this election is just another rumba chavista. With the catchy song, a dog dancing, and the infamous candidate La M\u00e1scara.\u201cWe\u2019re going to knock on the door of anyone who gets confused\u2026 Our message is to vote, to consolidate what we have accomplished.\u201dThe farce element runs deep here. In reality there\u2019s no sense of anticipation at all, all candidates represent the same party. Out of the 537 constituents, perhaps 7 to 10 of them will make decisions: the other fivehundred-some-odd are purely filler, there to raise their hand on command. Which ones get elected matters exclusively to the individuals involved.Still, you need to get people to vote.But the real reason to vote has nothing to do with any cute song. It\u2019s fear.Venezuela has more than two million public sector workers, and each one is well aware that la masa no est\u00e1 pa\u2019 bollos.The time for subtle coaxing and coded messages is long gone. Chavismo\u2019s get-out-the-vote strategy consists of threatening them mercilessly.Maduro already said that voters must present their ID and Carnet de la Patria at the door of every voting center, \u201cto see who votes.\u201d\u201cIf we have 15,000 workers (in a public institution), all 15,000 must vote, no excuse\u201d, PSUV leader Diosdado Cabello said as he explained the way the Carnet de la Patria allows the government to keep track of who\u2019s voted and who hasn\u2019t, in real time.\u201cWe\u2019re going to knock on the door of anyone who gets confused,\u201d Diosdado went on. \u201cOur message is to vote, to consolidate what we have accomplished.\u201dAs for vice-president Tarek El Aissami, he is leveraging the CLAP grocery distribution: \u201cWe didn\u2019t let you die. Now it\u2019s your turn to not let the revolution die\u201d.And that\u2019s a bouquet of subtlety compared to ANC candidate and brother of late President Ch\u00e1vez, Ad\u00e1n Ch\u00e1vez, who said \u201cif we have to take up arms to defend the legacy of Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro, we will\u201d.The interior Minister, N\u00e9stor Reverol, decided that the threats will not be exclusive for chavista voters, assuring that now any meeting or protest that \u201ccan affect\u201d the election is prohibited, adding that this \u201ccrime\u201d will be be punished with 5 to 10 years in prison.The economic crisis is part of the campaign. Maduro has assured us that, with the Constituyente, all economic problems will be fixed, even raising the minimum wage weeks before the election.Some of the threats are startlingly direct\u2026Money talks, even in voting centers, but governor Vielma Mora took a step forward proposing that any \u201ccompany or person\u201d who doesn\u2019t vote, shouldn\u2019t participate in the Dicom foreign exchange system. As he sees it, that would be giving dollars \u201cto right wing terrorists.\u201dIt\u2019s legitimately scary when you realize he\u2019s not alone in this line of thought.These threats have crossed the country and even reached Colombian borders. Roberth Guerra, a leader of Un Nuevo Tiempo in T\u00e1chira, denounced that \u201cpublic workers of the border, dependent of the regional and national government, have told us how the authorities intimidate them \u2013 they must sign a letter of resignation if they fail to vote, they have been threatened to lose their CLAP bags, and told that pensions for the elderly will be revoked.\u201dOn July 16th, the opposition drew its line in the sand: 7.6 million. The goal for the government is to overcome that mark. With money tight, that won\u2019t be easy.

{"text": "Teaching student jailed over Sweden terror plotThe 20-year-old and his lawyer.Photo: Janerik Henriksson/TTA 20-year-old former teaching student has been locked up for five years for plotting a suicide attack in Sweden.Aydin Sevigin was arrested in February, suspected of having tried to build a bomb.Police found six bottles of aceton, duct tape, a mobile phone and bullets during a search of his home.A receipt for Christmas tree lights and surveillance footage showing him buying a pressure cooker from Ikea were also part of the case.The 20-year-old, who grew up in the well-off suburb Danderyd north of Stockholm, denied the claims, but refused to explain why he bought the ingredients, which can be used to build bombs.\"My opinion is that he acquired, stored and collected liquids and objects to make and then blow up a suicide bomb in order to become a martyr.The criminal act being prepared could seriously have hurt Sweden,\" prosecutor Ewamari H\u00e4ggkvist said ahead of the verdict.Attunda District Court, north of Stockholm, sentenced him to five years in jail on Thursday morning for \"preparing to commit a terror crime\".It said it had reduced the sentence by one year because he is aged under 21.\"It is not clear what would have been the target of a bomb attack.But we believe that blowing up a shrapnel bomb of this kind would have been able to harm Sweden and that the purpose of such a bomb must have been to instil fear in the way referred to by terrorism legislation,\" said the chairman of the court, Mikael Swahn, in a statement.Sevigin's relatives had raised the alarm several months before he was arrested.In June last year one of his family members called the police, saying he was concerned about the 20-year-old, who had then disappeared.He was shortly thereafter stopped in Turkey on two occasions.The first time he was made to return to Greece, the second time he was flown back to Sweden from Istanbul.His intention is believed to have been to travel onwards to Syria to join Isis.Several of his relatives stated during the investigation and trial that the 20-year-old had been experiencing symptoms of depression, isolating himself from others and expressing radical opinions sympathizing with Isis.It was not immediately known if his legal team would attempt to appeal the sentence.The verdict came on the same day as a separate terror trial got under way in Sweden.A 25-year-old man is charged with attempting to travel to Syria to join a militant group.The trial is the first of its kind applying Sweden's new anti-terror laws making it illegal to travel abroad to join terror organizations.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain jailed <extra_id_0> Detainee Teaching student <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer Sweden <extra_id_1>

{"text": "Investigation of the Belated Production of Documents in the Oklahoma City Bombing Case\"The bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on April 19, 1995, was, at the time, the most significant act of terrorism that had ever taken place in the United States. Government agencies, led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), immediately began an extensive investigation to identify and prosecute the culprits. The investigation, known as OKBOMB, was run by a Task Force that consisted primarily of FBI investigators and support personnel and Department of Justice prosecutors. Within a few months, three individuals-Timothy McVeigh, Terry Nichols, and Michael Fortier-were indicted for crimes relating to the bombing. McVeigh and Nichols were convicted after trials, and Fortier pled guilty as part of a plea agreement with the government. McVeigh, who had devised the plot to bomb the Murrah Building and had planted the bomb, was sentenced to death. On May 8, 2001, one week before McVeigh's scheduled execution date, the Department of Justice and the FBI revealed to McVeigh's and Nichols' attorneys that over 700 investigative documents had not been disclosed to the defendants before their trials. The government acknowledged that it had violated a discovery order in the case, and the Attorney General stayed McVeigh's execution for one month in order to resolve the legal issues arising from the belated disclosure. Following the public revelation of the problem, and after finding and releasing more than 300 additional OKBOMB documents to the defense, the FBI came under severe criticism for its handling of the OKBOMB documents.\"United States.

{"text": "(NaturalNews) The socialist \"revolution\" against democracy and free markets is proceeding in Venezuela, with the authoritarian government downplaying a mysterious disease outbreak as print media in the country slowly dies off.As reported by WPLG'sin Miami, there have been at least 10 deaths from the as-yet-unidentified disease. The deaths have occurred in several Venezuelan cities, including the capital of Caracas. As it spreads, the disease is creating panic among the population and has led some of the nation's physicians to sound the alarm.However, as WPLG reported, the warnings are being downplayed by the socialist government:However, though the government remains in denial mode, doctors in Venezuela are taking the threat seriously; they say there is genuine reason for concern, especially in a country where government policies have created nightmarish shortages of everything from basic food supplies to medicines. Plus, they say the disease is both dangerous and contagious.\"We do not know what it is,\" Duglas Leon Natera, president of the Venezuelan Medical Federation, said, according to WPLG.At first, those infected present with a fever and spots on the skin, which then produce large blisters followed by internal and external bleeding, says data provided by the College of Physicians in the state of Aragua, where the first cases were seen.From that point, the disease progresses very quickly; patients begin suffering from respiratory failure, then kidney failure. And thus far, Venezuelan doctors have not been able to figure out what they are dealing with, let alone a treatment plan.And the government is hindering the process, largely by denying that there even is \"a mysterious disease ,\" because that's what dictatorial, socialist leaders do: claim infallibility and blame others. One official called the doctors' information nothing but a \"media campaign against Venezuela .\"And the governor of the state of Aragua, Tarek El-Aissami, along with Communications Minister Delcy Rodriguez, has labeled the warnings a \"defamatory\" strategy to \"distress to the population.\"Doctors are not completely in the dark; some have speculated on what the disease might be. Theories include a new type of very aggressive, severe dengue fever and a different version of Chikungunya fever; some have even suggested that it could be Ebola.Meanwhile, as its people die, so, too, does Venezuela's ability to inform its people; the country's print media is slowing dying too, suffering from a lack of newsprint, as WPLG reported:According to a newly released report by the Institute for Press and Society of Venezuela, or IPYS, 34 newspapers and magazines in 11 states have reported in the past year chronic shortages and difficulties acquiring supplies and other materials to print, such as ink, film and plates.The situation has been made worse by the government's strict controls on acquiring foreign exchange, as well as interference in the internal processes of suppliers. An exchange rate control was enacted in the country 11 years ago; it required companies to apply for permits in order to purchase foreign currency and import goods. And newspaper owners have been saying it has been months since they were granted permits to buy newsprint.\"Due to the impossibility of securing newsprint and print materials, 10 print outlets have stopped circulating altogether and four others have halted circulation temporarily,\" WPLG reported. \"Others have reduced the number of pages per edition, sometimes by more than half, or stopped running during the weekend in order to survive.\"In fact, the report said, the oldest Venezuelan daily,, nearly shuttered recently.\"The newspaper industry is in a coma in Venezuela,\" the paper's president, Carlos Eduardo Carmona, said. \"The government is slowly killing the free press in Venezuela.\"As for the doctors who tried to warn the public?

{"text": "Despite President Barack Obama\u2019s recent call to reduce the United States\u2019 reliance on drones, they will likely remain his administration\u2019s weapon of choice. Whereas President George W. Bush oversaw fewer than 50 drone strikes during his tenure, Obama has signed off on over 400 of them in the last four years, making the program the centerpiece of U.S. counterterrorism strategy. The drones have done their job remarkably well: by killing key leaders and denying terrorists sanctuaries in Pakistan, Yemen, and, to a lesser degree, Somalia, drones have devastated al Qaeda and associated anti-American militant groups. And they have done so at little financial cost, at no risk to U.S. forces, and with fewer civilian casualties than many alternative methods would have caused.Critics, however, remain skeptical. They claim that drones kill thousands of innocent civilians, alienate allied governments, anger foreign publics, illegally target Americans, and set a dangerous precedent that irresponsible governments will abuse. Some of these criticisms are valid; others, less so. In the end, drone strikes remain a necessary instrument of counterterrorism. The United States simply cannot tolerate terrorist safe havens in remote parts of Pakistan and elsewhere, and drones offer a comparatively low-risk way of targeting these areas while minimizing collateral damage.So drone warfare is here to stay, and it is likely to expand in the years to come as other countries\u2019 capabilities catch up with those of the United States. But Washington must continue to improve its drone policy, spelling out clearer rules for extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings so that tyrannical regimes will have a harder time pointing to the U.S. drone program to justify attacks against political opponents. At the same time, even as it solidifies the drone program, Washington must remain mindful of the built-in limits of low-cost, unmanned interventions, since the very convenience of drone warfare risks dragging the United States into conflicts it could otherwise avoid.NOBODY DOES IT BETTERThe Obama administration relies on drones for one simple reason: they work. According to data compiled by the New America Foundation, since Obama has been in the White House, U.S. drones have killed an estimated 3,300 al Qaeda, Taliban, and other jihadist operatives in Pakistan and Yemen. That number includes over 50 senior leaders of al Qaeda and the Taliban\u2014top figures who are not easily replaced. In 2010, Osama bin Laden warned his chief aide, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, who was later killed by a drone strike in the Waziristan region of Pakistan in 2011, that when experienced leaders are eliminated, the result is \u201cthe rise of lower leaders who are not as experienced as the former leaders\u201d and who are prone to errors and miscalculations. And drones also hurt terrorist organizations when they eliminate operatives who are lower down on the food chain but who boast special skills: passport forgers, bomb makers, recruiters, and fundraisers.Drones have also undercut terrorists\u2019 ability to communicate and to train new recruits. In order to avoid attracting drones, al Qaeda and Taliban operatives try to avoid using electronic devices or gathering in large numbers. A tip sheet found among jihadists in Mali advised militants to \u201cmaintain complete silence of all wireless contacts\u201d and \u201cavoid gathering in open areas.\u201d Leaders, however, cannot give orders when they are incommunicado, and training on a large scale is nearly impossible when a drone strike could wipe out an entire group of new recruits. Drones have turned al Qaeda\u2019s command and training structures into a liability, forcing the group to choose between having no leaders and risking dead leaders.Critics of drone strikes often fail to take into account the fact that the alternatives are either too risky or unrealistic. To be sure, in an ideal world, militants would be captured alive, allowing authorities to question them and search their compounds for useful information. Raids, arrests, and interrogations can produce vital intelligence and can be less controversial than lethal operations. That is why they should be, and indeed already are, used in stable countries where the United States enjoys the support of the host government. But in war zones or unstable countries, such as Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia, arresting militants is highly dangerous and, even if successful, often inefficient. In those three countries, the government exerts little or no control over remote areas, which means that it is highly dangerous to go after militants hiding out there. Worse yet, in Pakistan and Yemen, the governments have at times cooperated with militants. If the United States regularly sent in special operations forces to hunt down terrorists there, sympathetic officials could easily tip off the jihadists, likely leading to firefights, U.S. casualties, and possibly the deaths of the suspects and innocent civilians.Of course, it was a Navy SEAL team and not a drone strike that finally got bin Laden, but in many cases in which the United States needs to capture or eliminate an enemy, raids are too risky and costly. And even if a raid results in a successful capture, it begets another problem: what to do with the detainee. Prosecuting detainees in a federal or military court is difficult because often the intelligence against terrorists is inadmissible or using it risks jeopardizing sources and methods. And given the fact that the United States is trying to close, rather than expand, the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, it has become much harder to justify holding suspects indefinitely. It has become more politically palatable for the United States to kill rather than detain suspected terrorists.Furthermore, although a drone strike may violate the local state\u2019s sovereignty, it does so to a lesser degree than would putting U.S. boots on the ground or conducting a large-scale air campaign. And compared with a 500-pound bomb dropped from an F-16, the grenadelike warheads carried by most drones create smaller, more precise blast zones that decrease the risk of unexpected structural damage and casualties. Even more important, drones, unlike traditional airplanes, can loiter above a target for hours, waiting for the ideal moment to strike and thus reducing the odds that civilians will be caught in the kill zone.Finally, using drones is also far less bloody than asking allies to hunt down terrorists on the United States\u2019 behalf. The Pakistani and Yemeni militaries, for example, are known to regularly torture and execute detainees, and they often indiscriminately bomb civilian areas or use scorched-earth tactics against militant groups.Some critics of the drone program, such as Ben Emmerson, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, have questioned the lethal approach, arguing for more focus on the factors that might contribute to extremism and terrorism, such as poverty, unemployment, and authoritarianism. Such a strategy is appealing in principle, but it is far from clear how Washington could execute it. Individuals join anti-American terrorist groups for many reasons, ranging from outrage over U.S. support for Israel to anger at their own government\u2019s cooperation with the United States. Some people simply join up because their neighbors are doing so. Slashing unemployment in Yemen, bringing democracy to Saudi Arabia, and building a functioning government in Somalia are laudable goals, but they are not politically or financially possible for the United States, and even if achieved, they still might not reduce the allure of jihad.In some cases, the most sensible alternative to carrying out drone strikes is to do nothing at all. At times, that is the right option: if militants abroad pose little threat or if the risk of killing civilians, delegitimizing allies, or establishing the wrong precedent is too high. But sometimes imminent and intolerable threats do arise and drone strikes are the best way to eliminate them.THE NUMBERS GAMEDespite the obvious benefits of using drones and the problems associated with the alternatives, numerous critics argue that drones still have too many disadvantages. First among them is an unacceptably high level of civilian casualties. Admittedly, drones have killed innocents. But the real debate is over how many and whether alternative approaches are any better. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reports that in 2011, drone strikes killed as many as 146 noncombatants, including as many as 9 children. Columbia Law School\u2019s Human Rights Clinic also cites high numbers of civilian deaths, as does the Pakistani organization Pakistan Body Count. Peter Bergen of the New America Foundation oversees a database of drone casualties culled from U.S. sources and international media reports. He estimates that between 150 and 500 civilians have been killed by drones during Obama\u2019s administration. U.S. officials, meanwhile, maintain that drone strikes have killed almost no civilians. In June 2011, John Brennan, then Obama\u2019s top counterterrorism adviser, even contended that U.S. drone strikes had killed no civilians in the previous year. But these claims are based on the fact that the U.S. government assumes that all military-age males in the blast area of a drone strike are combatants\u2014 unless it can determine after the fact that they were innocent (and such intelligence gathering is not a priority).The United States has recently taken to launching \u201csignature strikes,\u201d which target not specific individuals but instead groups engaged in suspicious activities. This approach makes it even more difficult to distinguish between combatants and civilians and verify body counts of each. Still, as one U.S. official told The New York Times last year, \u201cAl Qaeda is an insular, paranoid organization\u2014innocent neighbors don\u2019t hitchhike rides in the back of trucks headed for the border with guns and bombs.\u201d Of course, not everyone accepts this reasoning. Zeeshan-ul-hassan Usmani, who runs Pakistan Body Count, says that \u201cneither [the United States] nor Pakistan releases any detailed information about the victims . . . so [although the United States] likes to call everybody Taliban, I call everybody civilians.\u201dThe truth is that all the public numbers are unreliable. Who constitutes a civilian is often unclear; when trying to kill the Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud, for example, the United States also killed his doctor. The doctor was not targeting U.S. or allied forces, but he was aiding a known terrorist leader. In addition, most strikes are carried out in such remote locations that it is nearly impossible for independent sources to verify who was killed. In Pakistan, for example, the overwhelming majority of drone killings occur in tribal areas that lie outside the government\u2019s control and are prohibitively dangerous for Westerners and independent local journalists to enter. Thus, although the New America Foundation has come under fire for relying heavily on unverifiable information provided by anonymous U.S. officials, reports from local Pakistani organizations, and the Western organizations that rely on them, are no better: their numbers are frequently doctored by the Pakistani government or by militant groups. After a strike in Pakistan, militants often cordon off the area, remove their dead, and admit only local reporters sympathetic to their cause or decide on a body count themselves. The U.S. media often then draw on such faulty reporting to give the illusion of having used multiple sources. As a result, statistics on civilians killed by drones are often inflated. One of the few truly independent on-the-ground reporting efforts, conducted by the Associated Press last year, concluded that the strikes \u201care killing far fewer civilians than many in [Pakistan] are led to believe.\u201dBut even the most unfavorable estimates of drone casualties reveal that the ratio of civilian to militant deaths\u2014about one to three, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism\u2014is lower than it would be for other forms of strikes. Bombings by F-16s or Tomahawk cruise missile salvos, for example, pack a much more deadly payload. In December 2009, the United States fired Tomahawks at a suspected terrorist training camp in Yemen, and over 30 people were killed in the blast, most of them women and children. At the time, the Yemeni regime refused to allow the use of drones, but had this not been the case, a drone\u2019s real-time surveillance would probably have spotted the large number of women and children, and the attack would have been aborted. Even if the strike had gone forward for some reason, the drone\u2019s far smaller warhead would have killed fewer innocents. Civilian deaths are tragic and pose political problems. But the data show that drones are more discriminate than other types of force.FOREIGN FRIENDSIt is also telling that drones have earned the backing, albeit secret, of foreign governments. In order to maintain popular support, politicians in Pakistan and Yemen routinely rail against the U.S. drone campaign. In reality, however, the governments of both countries have supported it. During the Bush and Obama administrations, Pakistan has even periodically hosted U.S. drone facilities and has been told about strikes in advance. Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan until 2008, was not worried about the drone program\u2019s negative publicity: \u201cIn Pakistan, things fall out of the sky all the time,\u201d he reportedly remarked. Yemen\u2019s former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, also at times allowed drone strikes in his country and even covered for them by telling the public that they were conducted by the Yemeni air force. When the United States\u2019 involvement was leaked in 2002, however, relations between the two countries soured. Still, Saleh later let the drone program resume in Yemen, and his replacement, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has publicly praised drones, saying that \u201cthey pinpoint the target and have zero margin of error, if you know what target you\u2019re aiming at.\u201dAs officials in both Pakistan and Yemen realize, U.S. drone strikes help their governments by targeting common enemies. A memo released by the antisecrecy website WikiLeaks revealed that Pakistan\u2019s army chief, Ashfaq Parvez kayani, privately asked U.S. military leaders in 2008 for \u201ccontinuous Predator coverage\u201d over antigovernment militants, and the journalist Mark Mazzetti has reported that the United States has conducted \u201cgoodwill kills\u201d against Pakistani militants who threatened Pakistan far more than the United States. Thus, in private, Pakistan supports the drone program. As then Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani told Anne Patterson, then the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, in 2008, \u201cWe\u2019ll protest [against the drone program] in the National Assembly and then ignore it.\u201dStill, Pakistan is reluctant to make its approval public. First of all, the country\u2019s inability to fight terrorists on its own soil is a humiliation for Pakistan\u2019s politically powerful armed forces and intelligence service. In addition, although drones kill some of the government\u2019s enemies, they have also targeted pro-government groups that are hostile to the United States, such as the Haqqani network and the Taliban, which Pakistan has supported since its birth in the early 1990s. Even more important, the Pakistani public is vehemently opposed to U.S. drone strikes.A 2012 poll found that 74 percent of Pakistanis viewed the United States as their enemy, likely in part because of the ongoing drone campaign. Similarly, in Yemen, as the scholar Gregory Johnsen has pointed out, drone strikes can win the enmity of entire tribes. This has led critics to argue that the drone program is shortsighted: that it kills today\u2019s enemies but creates tomorrow\u2019s in the process.Such concerns are valid, but the level of local anger over drones is often lower than commonly portrayed. Many surveys of public opinion related to drones are conducted by anti-drone organizations, which results in biased samples. Other surveys exclude those who are unaware of the drone program and thus overstate the importance of those who are angered by it. In addition, many Pakistanis do not realize that the drones often target the very militants who are wreaking havoc on their country. And for most Pakistanis and Yemenis, the most important problems they struggle with are corruption, weak representative institutions, and poor economic growth; the drone program is only a small part of their overall anger, most of which is directed toward their own governments. A poll conducted in 2007, well before the drone campaign had expanded to its current scope, found that only 15 percent of Pakistanis had a favorable opinion of the United States. It is hard to imagine that alternatives to drone strikes, such as seal team raids or cruise missile strikes, would make the United States more popular.THE HOME FRONTStill, public opposition is real, and there is growing concern about the drone strikes even in the United States. The program came under especially heavy criticism domestically in 2011, when Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen born in New Mexico, was killed by a drone strike in Yemen. There is no question that Awlaki was dangerous. Adept at interspersing Islamist rhetoric with pop-culture references, Awlaki had been described as a \u201cpied piper for Western ears\u201d: one admirer was Nidal Malik Hasan, the U.S. Army officer who killed 13 U.S. soldiers at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009.The Obama administration claims that Awlaki was actively involved in plots against the United States and that the strike against him was legal under the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF), which Congress passed three days after 9/11 and which gives the president broad authority to use force against terrorist groups linked to the 9/11 attacks. Yet with the war on terrorism almost 12 years old and bin Laden dead, critics, such as the Georgetown University law professor Rosa Brooks, have begun questioning whether the AUMF still justifies drone strikes today. As Brooks has argued, \u201cMany of the groups now being identified as threats don\u2019t fall clearly under the AUMF\u2019s umbrella\u2014and many don\u2019t pose a significant danger to the United States.\u201d As for the case of Awlaki, opponents of his killing have argued that he did not pose an imminent threat to the United States and that in keeping the evidence used to justify his assassination secret, the administration violated the constitutional guarantee of due process for U.S. citizens. As Ron Paul, then a Texas representative, pointed out during his presidential campaign, Awlaki was never charged with any crime. He added, \u201cIf the American people accept this blindly and casually, that we now have an accepted practice of the president assassinating people who he thinks are bad guys, I think it\u2019s sad.\u201dThe administration contends that the discussions held within the executive branch and the extensive vetting of evidence constitute a form of due process. Meanwhile, as the legal scholar Benjamin Wittes has pointed out, both Congress and the federal courts have repeatedly reaffirmed the validity of the AUMF since 2001. The U.S. government argues that given how secretly terrorists operate, it is not always possible to use other means to stop an individual overseas from planning attacks on U.S. forces or allies. As a result, the imminence of a threat should be assessed based on the individual\u2019s propensity for violence and the likelihood of being able to stop him in the future. Wittes compares the decision-making process to that used in hostage situations, when police are not required to ask a judge for authority to kill a hostage taker or refrain from taking a clear shot if they have one. Perhaps most important, the White House has claimed only a very limited right to conduct drone strikes against U.S. citizens. The administration has asserted the authority to kill only senior al Qaeda leaders who cannot be captured, not any American member of al Qaeda. Indeed, it appears that Awlaki is the only U.S. citizen who has been deliberately killed by a drone.?FOLLOW THE LEADERThe fact remains that by using drones so much, Washington risks setting a troublesome precedent with regard to extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings. Zeke Johnson of Amnesty International contends that \u201cwhen the U.S. government violates international law, that sets a precedent and provides an excuse for the rest of the world to do the same.\u201d And it is alarming to think what leaders such as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has used deadly force against peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators he has deemed terrorists, would do with drones of their own. Similarly, Iran could mockingly cite the U.S. precedent to justify sending drones after rebels in Syria. Even Brennan has conceded that the administration is \u201cestablishing precedents that other nations may follow.\u201dControlling the spread of drone technology will prove impossible; that horse left the barn years ago. Drones are highly capable weapons that are easy to produce, and so there is no chance that Washington can stop other militaries from acquiring and using them. Nearly 90 other countries already have surveillance drones in their arsenals, and China is producing several inexpensive models for export. Armed drones are more difficult to produce and deploy, but they, too, will likely spread rapidly. Beijing even recently announced (although later denied) that it had considered sending a drone to Myanmar (also called Burma) to kill a wanted drug trafficker hiding there.The spread of drones cannot be stopped, but the United States can still influence how they are used. The coming proliferation means that Washington needs to set forth a clear policy now on extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings of terrorists\u2014and stick to it. Fortunately, Obama has begun to discuss what constitutes a legitimate drone strike. But the definition remains murky, and this murkiness will undermine the president\u2019s ability to denounce other countries\u2019 behavior should they start using drones or other means to hunt down enemies. By keeping its policy secret, Washington also makes it easier for critics to claim that the United States is wantonly slaughtering innocents. More transparency would make it harder for countries such as Pakistan to make outlandish claims about what the United States is doing. Drones actually protect many Pakistanis, and Washington should emphasize this fact. By being more open, the administration could also show that it carefully considers the law and the risks to civilians before ordering a strike.Washington needs to be especially open about its use of signature strikes. According to the Obama administration, signature strikes have eliminated not only low-level al Qaeda and Taliban figures but also a surprising number of higher-level officials whose presence at the scenes of the strikes was unexpected. Signature strikes are in keeping with traditional military practice; for the most part, U.S. soldiers have been trained to strike enemies at large, such as German soldiers or Vietcong guerrillas, and not specific individuals. The rise of unconventional warfare, however, has made this usual strategy more difficult because the battlefield is no longer clearly defined and enemies no longer wear identifiable uniforms, making combatants harder to distinguish from civilians. In the case of drones, where there is little on-the-ground knowledge of who is who, signature strikes raise legitimate concerns, especially because the Obama administration has not made clear what its rules and procedures for such strikes are.Washington should exercise particular care with regard to signature strikes because mistakes risk tarnishing the entire drone program. In the absence of other information, the argument that drones are wantonly killing innocents is gaining traction in the United States and abroad. More transparency could help calm these fears that Washington is acting recklessly.The U.S. government also needs to guard against another kind of danger: that the relative ease of using drones will make U.S. intervention abroad too common. The scholars Daniel Brunstetter and Megan Braun have argued that drones provide \u201ca way to avoid deploying troops or conducting an intensive bombing campaign\u201d and that this \u201cmay encourage countries to act on just cause with an ease that is potentially worrisome.\u201d Although al Qaeda remains a threat, it has been substantially defanged since 9/11, thanks to the destruction of its haven in Afghanistan and effective global police, intelligence, and drone campaigns against its cells. In addition, the U.S. government needs to remember that many of the world\u2019s jihadist organizations are focused first and foremost on local regimes and that although the United States has an interest in helping its allies fight extremists, Washington cannot and should not directly involve itself in every fight. The Obama administration should spell out those cases in which the AUMF does not apply and recognize the risks of carrying out so-called goodwill kills on behalf of foreign governments. Helping French and Malian forces defeat jihadists in Mali by providing logistical support, for example, is smart policy, but sending U.S. drones there is not.In places where terrorists are actively plotting against the United States, however, drones give Washington the ability to limit its military commitments abroad while keeping Americans safe. Afghanistan, for example, could again become a Taliban-run haven for terrorists after U.S. forces depart next year. Drones can greatly reduce the risk of this happening. Hovering in the skies above, they can keep Taliban leaders on the run and hinder al Qaeda\u2019s ability to plot another 9/11.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim operatives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer U.S <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Yemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Place Pakistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim Atiyah Abd al-Rahman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim innocents <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim children <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strikes <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Killer United States <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim doctor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Victim Baitullah Mehsud <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Yemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack fired <extra_id_0> Instrument Tomahawks <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker United States <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Killer officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Texas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Place Yemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim Anwar al-Awlaki <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TeachingTrainingLearning train <extra_id_0> Learner recruits <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Had his homemade bomb gone off\u2014one he had diabolically constructed using shrapnel coated with a substance meant to keep blood from clotting in wounds\u2014Kevin Harpham would have undoubtedly caused the death and injury of many people at last year\u2019s Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Unity March in Spokane, Washington.Instead, Harpham was eventually caught and recently sentenced to 32 years in prison for a hate crime and other offenses related to the attempted bombing. The case illustrates how a quick response by citizens and local law enforcement averted a tragedy and how teamwork and time-tested investigative techniques led to the apprehension of an individual who has shown no remorse for his actions.\u201cClearly he intended to detonate the device, cause mass carnage, and then survey the devastation,\u201d said Special Agent Frank Harrill, who supervised the investigation. \u201cHarpham was acting out against what he termed multiculturalism, but his hatred was firmly rooted in violent white supremacy. This was a prototypical hate crime.\u201dOn January 17, 2011, as hundreds of people gathered in downtown Spokane to participate in the march, Harpham placed his backpack bomb along the parade route at Washington Street and Main Avenue. Alert city workers discovered the suspicious backpack before the march started, and Spokane Police Department officials changed the route as a precaution. The Spokane Police and Sheriff\u2019s Office bomb squad was called in, and their precision in disarming the device enabled evidence to be preserved that would help lead FBI agents to Harpham.The FBI\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) in Spokane immediately began an investigation, and JTTF members canvassed the region for batteries and other components similar to those used in the bomb. Within a month, in a small town about 60 miles north of Spokane, they discovered that a local outlet of a large retail chain was selling the same kind of fishing weights Harpham had used as shrapnel.Store records showed there had been three large purchases of the weights in recent months\u2014two were paid for in cash, but a debit card was used in one transaction, and it belonged to Harpham. At the same time, the FBI Laboratory had been working to extract a DNA sample from the backpack that was later matched to Harpham through his military records.Investigators also learned of Harpham\u2019s white supremacy postings on the Internet and his affiliation with a neo-Nazi group called the National Alliance.Because he lived in a remote, relatively inaccessible area and was likely heavily armed, our Hostage Rescue Team devised a ruse to lure Harpham out of his house. He was arrested March 9, 2011 without incident\u2014but as agents suspected, he was armed when taken into custody.\u201cKevin Harpham was the lone wolf that all of us in law enforcement dread,\u201d Harrill said. \u201cHe lived alone, he worked alone, and he didn\u2019t foreshadow the bombing plot in any meaningful way. He targeted those who were attempting to celebrate an event meant to unite society,\u201d Harrill added, \u201cand he was prepared to indiscriminately kill men, women, and children.\u201dHarrill credited teamwork and strong partnerships for stopping Harpham and bringing him to justice. \u201cFrom the workers who noticed the device to the police response, the JTTF investigation, the expertise of the FBI Laboratory, and the prosecuting skill of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office\u2014everything worked just as it should have.\u201dResources:- Washington Man Sentenced to 32 Years (12/20/2011)- Attempted Bomber Pleads Guilty (09/07/2011)- Attempted Bomber Arrested (03/09/2011)", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentenced <extra_id_0> Defendant Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime offenses  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain caught <extra_id_0> Detainee Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain Arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Bomber <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence Sentenced <extra_id_0> Defendant Man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle disarming <extra_id_0> Artifact device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Disabler squad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Harrill <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Kevin Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonate <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Frank Harrill <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator Joint Terrorism Task Force <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Victim children <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact added <extra_id_0> Participant Harrill <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ImpedeInterfereWith stopping  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict Pleads Guilty <extra_id_0> Defendant Bomber <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack gone off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice his homemade bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble constructed <extra_id_0> Artifact one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components substance <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die death <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injury <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate march <extra_id_0> Demonstrator people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell purchases <extra_id_0> PaymentBarter debit card <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact postings <extra_id_0> Participant Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic white supremacy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection discovered <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity backpack <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Observer workers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate march  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "FBI Increases Reward for 2008 Times Square Bombing InformationNEW YORK \u2014\u00a0U.S. federal authorities on Wednesday announced an increased reward of $115,000 for information leading to the conviction of individuals responsible for the 2008 bombing in New York's Times Square.The FBI, which had offered a $65,000 reward in 2013, said it was actively pursuing several \"persons of interest,\" and has identified the origin of the explosive device's components.\"However, we're going to need more input and information from the general public if we're going to solve this case,\" Peter Tzitzis, an FBI special agent, told reporters.The bomb exploded at about 3:45 a.m. local time on March 6, 2008, at the Armed Forces Recruiting Station, a small, stand-alone building in the heart of Times Square. No one was wounded by the blast which caused only minor damage.Authorities have said a suspect on a blue Ross bicycle dismounted, placed the bomb at the recruiting station, lit the fuse and fled. The bicycle was found in a dumpster several blocks away.The suspect appeared to be working alone but could have had a lookout or a surveillance team of as many as five others, authorities said.At a press conference on Wednesday, FBI and New York Police Department officials said they believed the person who planted the device was male and that the incident was not tied to any foreign organizations.The explosion might be connected to two other New York bombings, one at the British Consulate in 2005 and another at the Mexican Consulate in 2007, the FBI said.The consulate bombs were also placed by someone on a bicycle and detonated between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m., authorities said.The explosive device used in Times Square was detonated with a time fuse and built using an ammunition can commonly found on battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, the FBI said.The announcement of the new reward came as Boston marked the second anniversary of the attack on its annual marathon that killed three people and injured 264.While no one was harmed in the Times Square incident, the FBI said the case remained a \"top priority.\"In May 2013, Gerald Koch, a self-described anarchist from Brooklyn, was jailed after refusing to testify as a witness before a federal grand jury thought to be investigating the explosion. A federal judge ordered Koch's release in January 2014.The FBI's Tzitzis said several other individuals have come forward with information and \"good progress\" was being made.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Armed Forces Recruiting Station <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Times Square <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 264 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain jailed <extra_id_0> Detainee Gerald Koch <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for an attack by a man who plowed an SUV into pedestrians and then stabbed a police officer.\u201cWe remain keen to hear from anyone who knew Khalid Masood well, understands who his associates were and can provide us with information about places he has recently visited,\u2019\u2019 Rowley said. \u201cThere might be people out there who did have concerns about Masood but did not feel comfortable for whatever reason in passing those concerns to us.\u2019\u2019Islamic State said Masood, who was 52, was a \u201csoldier\u201d of the extremist group who responded to its call to attack civilians and the military in countries allied with the United States in battling IS.Masood had never been convicted of terrorist offenses, but British security officials said he had been investigated in the past \u201cin relation to concerns about violent extremism.\u201d Authorities say they believe he was acting alone Wednesday when he ran down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, a Thames River crossing leading to the Houses of Parliament, crashed his rented vehicle into a gate and fatally stabbed a policeman who tried to stop him.Armed police shot and killed Masood moments later.A property in Birmingham, England, was searched by police following Wednesday's London attack, March 23, 2017.In the hours after Wednesday\u2019s attack in the heart of London, police conducted raids around the country in search of anyone who may have given support to Masood. Eight men and women were arrested Thursday on suspicion of planning terrorist acts.The dead assailant, who was older than most Islamist attackers involved in recent spectacular terror attacks in Europe, had been a teacher of English and was known as a fanatical bodybuilder.One of the civilians who was run down on the bridge, a 75-year-old man, died Thursday in a hospital, raising the casualty toll to four victims and Masood.Although Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, a statement posted online did not implicate the group in the planning or execution of the attack.An Italian tourist who witnessed the carnage told reporters he saw Masood attack the policeman with two knives. \u201cHe gave [the officer] around 10 stabs in the back,\u201d the visitor said.Valiant efforts to resuscitate Constable Keith Palmer at the scene failed. The 48-year-old officer was a 15-year police veteran.One American was among the dead - 54-year-old Kurt Cochran of Utah, who was in London with his wife to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. His wife, Melissa, was among the 30 people injured. Masood\u2019s vehicle hit the Cochrans as they crossed Westminster Bridge.The remaining victim of the attack was a British school administrator, Aysha Frade, 43.Candles burn on Westminster Bridge the day after an attack in London, March 23, 2017.Mourners gathered in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square Thursday evening, about one kilometer from the crime scene, for a candlelight vigil.

He declined to say whether or how those detained were involved in Wednesday\u2019s attack.\u201cIt is still our belief, which continues to be born out by our investigation, that this attacker acted alone and was inspired by international terrorism,\u201d Rowley told reporters.Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May gives a media statement outside 10 Downing street in London, March 22, 2017, following a terror attack in the Westminster area of London earlier Wednesday.Prime Minister Theresa May struck a defiant tone in discussing the attack before Parliament Thursday, telling British lawmakers that what London experienced was \u201can attack on free people everywhere.\u201d\u201cYesterday an act of terrorism tried to silence our democracy, but today we meet as normal, as generations have done before us and as future generations will continue to do, to deliver a simple message: We are not afraid and our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism,\u201d she said.May thanked Britain\u2019s friends and allies around the world \u201cwho have made it clear that they stand with us at this time.\u201dShe said the victims include nationals of France, Romania, South Korea, Germany, Poland, Ireland, China, Italy and Greece, as well as the United States.The United Nations Security Council in New York, chaired by British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, observed a moment of silence Thursday for the London victims.Tense London Carries on After Islamic State AttackVideo sizewidthxheightpixelsTense London Carries on After Islamic State AttackShare this video0:02:20\u25b60:00:00/0:02:20\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 6.3MB360p | 9.3MB720p | 61.6MB\u201cYou may know that today there are victims in London from 11 nations.

{"text": "Third London Attacker Named as British PM Faces Mounting CriticismLONDON \u2014\u00a0British Prime Minister Theresa May is being forced to defend her past record as the country\u2019s interior minister, and the political architect of Britain\u2019s counter-terror system, as more details emerge of the three attackers and what security agencies knew about them before their van-and-knife rampage Saturday in the heart of London.Ahead of Thursday's vote in a snap post-Brexit parliamentary election, which May called with the expectation of securing a landslide victory, the terror attack is undermining the air of dogged competence May carefully crafted as the country's home secretary, a post she held for six years and relinquished on becoming prime minister last year.Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May speaks outside 10 Downing Street after an attack on London Bridge and Borough Market left 7 people dead and dozens injured in London, June 4, 2017.Foreign Minister Boris Johnson conceded Tuesday that there were questions to answer about how the three militants slipped through the intelligence net. He was speaking as police named the third attacker as 22-year-old Italian-Moroccan Youssef Zaghba, who was on an Italian watchlist and suspected of being a foreign fighter.Born in Fez, Morocco, in 1995 to an Italian mother and a Moroccan father, Zaghba was stopped by Italian police at the Bologna airport on March 15 of last year after arousing suspicions he was going to join the Islamic State terror group to fight in Syria.Italian officials say he had a one-way ticket to Istanbul and was carrying just a small backpack. His cell phone, which was seized, contained jihadist content, including pictures and videos, and he was placed on a watchlist as a suspected foreign fighter. Italian officials say they shared intelligence on him with both the British and Moroccan security agencies.Lived in BritainThe last few years Zaghba lived in Britain, where he worked on and off at a restaurant and a hotel near Regents Park, traveling back and forth to visit his mother, who lives in Bologna.The naming of the third Islamic militant came after it emerged earlier Tuesday that the ringleader of Saturday\u2019s attack, 27-year-old British-Pakistani Khuram Shazad Butt worked for a man accused of helping to train the Islamic extremists responsible for the July 7, 2005 underground train bombings in London, Britain\u2019s first Islamist suicide attack. Fifty-two people were killed across Britain\u2019s capital in the coordinated strike and more than 700 others were injured.This is undated three photo combo handout photo issued by the Metropolitan Police on Tuesday June 6, 2017 of Khuram Shazad Butt, left, Rachid Redouane, centre and Youssef Zaghba who have been named as the suspects in Saturday's attack at London Bridge.Counterterror analysts say they are surprised that Butt remained a \"low priority\" for the security services despite his close connections to Sajeel Shahid, a 41-year-old who ran an all-Muslin gym in east London and was named in a New York court case as having helped to set up weapons training in Pakistan for the July 7 suicide bombers.\u201cIt was a blunder to have downgraded the terror threat in Britain so quickly after the Manchester bombing,\u201d said Olivier Guitta, managing director at GlobalStrat, a security and geopolitical risk firm. He says with election campaigning under way coinciding with Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, the chances of attacks were always high.Guitta, who has advised government in the past on counterterrorism, said, \u201cNo one should be surprised by the terrorism wave and which is linked to a policy of laissez-faire policy toward extremists.\u201dThe main charge leveled against May by Labour politicians and the leaders of the country\u2019s smaller parties is the large cuts she introduced on funding for Britain\u2019s police. Those cuts resulted in police personnel being drawn down from 2010 to 2016 by more than 20,000 officers.Uncertain election impactOn Monday, the opposition parties received support for their criticism from an unlikely quarter. Conservative insider Steve Hilton, the policy guru of former Prime Minister David Cameron, demanded May resign over what he termed \u201csecurity failures,\u201d which he said led to Saturday\u2019s attack and the bombing of a concert last month in Manchester.He said May should be \u201cresigning, not seeking re-election.\u201dPollsters are wary of predicting how the terrorist attacks \u2014 three in the past 10 weeks \u2014 will impact the voting on Thursday, but Labour leaders say they have renewed hope at the very least of reducing the ruling Conservative\u2019s majority as they seek to recast their campaign message in the final hours before voting as \u201cinvestment versus cuts.\u201dOn Sunday, May promised to review Britain's counterterrorism strategy, holding out the prospect of enhanced powers for the security services and longer prison sentences for extremists. May said she wants to take a tougher line with internet providers and social media businesses that allow extremist material on their sites.She warned there has been \u201cfar too much tolerance of extremism\u201d in Britain and promised to step up the fight against Islamist terrorism after the London Bridge attack, saying \u201cenough is enough.\u201dVideo sizewidthxheightpixelsBritain PM May: 'Enough is Enough'Share this video0:00:30\u25b60:00:00/0:00:30\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 1.5MB360p | 1.8MB480p | 10.5MBBritish counterterror chiefs say that while Butt was investigated in 2015, he was deemed a low risk. According to Assistant Police Commissioner Mark Rowley, he had seen \u201cnothing to show that a poor decision has been made\u201d in 2015 and that police had no evidence Butt was planning anything.Police, however, confirm they received several warnings from neighbors and associates about Butt.British police and MI5 set up in 2013 an early warning system, known as Project Danube, to help them spot when low-priority suspects might be re-engaging in violent extremism. That program appears to have failed, say critics, as it did not help them identify Khalid Masood, the militant responsible for the Westminster Bridge attack in March that killed five people. Nor did it alert them to the Manchester Arena bomber, British-Libyan Salman Abedi.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack rampage <extra_id_0> Instrument knife <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> EndPosition relinquished <extra_id_0> Employee she <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PlaceOfEmployment home <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> StartPosition becoming <extra_id_0> Employee she <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target Borough Market <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim dozens <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TeachingTrainingLearning train <extra_id_0> Learner extremists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Place London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target train <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strike  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target London Bridge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TeachingTrainingLearning training  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Manchester <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Manchester <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target London Bridge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigated <extra_id_0> Defendant Butt <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target Westminster Bridge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Khalid Masood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

Every time someone tells this government the truth in connection with a disease, an economic problem or a security issue, that person automatically becomes a coup-plotter,\u201d said Douglas N\u00e1tera, president of the federation.Health Minister Nancy P\u00e9rez, who has held that portfolio for just a few days, made a public statement on Wednesday to address the growing social alarm.\u201cThe main thing is that there is no strange virus right now.

Another 1,200 patients are under observation.But Rafael Arreaza, a surgeon and former director of Venezuela\u2019s Social Security service, questioned the minister\u2019s figures and filed a complaint against the government with the Ombudsman.Arreaza said that for every patient diagnosed with Chikungunya, there could be as many as 1,000 more, and that the lack of lab material is preventing health workers from knowing the true magnitude of the problem.This former health official also said that 12 of the victims who died were showing similar symptoms, suggesting the need to find out whether the virus is mutating.In the face of this mounting pressure, President Maduro said he will take national and international legal action against any physician but also against any journalist, media outlet or individual who contributes to disseminating this theory through words or images.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak disease <extra_id_0> Place Venezuela <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak Chikungunya <extra_id_0> Victim patient <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak Chikungunya <extra_id_0> Victim patient <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak virus <extra_id_0> Victim victims <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

ReutersMeanwhile, Venezuelans appeared to be abstaining in massive numbers on Sunday in a show of silent protest against a vote to select a constitutional assembly giving the government virtually unlimited powers.Associated Press journalists toured more than two dozen polling places in neighborhoods across the capital, including many traditional strongholds of the ruling socialist party in southern and western Caracas. Virtually all the polling places saw hours-long lines of thousands of people in past elections over the last two decades of socialist government.One site, a sports and cultural complex known as the Poliedro, had several thousand people waiting about two hours to vote, many having traveled from opposition-dominated neighborhoods where polling places were closed. Of the dozens of others sites seen by the AP, two in the loyalist-heavy neighborhood of El Valle had lines of approximately 200 to 400 people. All the others had at most a couple of dozen voters, and many had less than a half-dozen or were completely empty.Opinion polls say more than 70 percent of the country is opposed to Sunday's vote.\"People aren't in agreement with this,\" said Daniel Ponza, a 33-year-old drywall contractor, as he watched a few dozen people outside a polling place in El Valle. \"People are dying of hunger, looking for food in the trash. And I think this is just going to make things worse.\"Sunday evening, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations sent a message on Twitter calling the Venezuela election a \"sham\" and \"step toward dictatorship\":Maduro\u2019s sham election is another step toward dictatorship.

ReutersWhen the female official of the National Electoral Council (CNE) proceeds to use a smartphone to scan Maduro's card, a second camera zooms in to reveal that according to CNE's own system, that \"person does not exist, or the card has been revoked.\"After scanning Maduro's national ID card, the smartphone read: \"person does not exist, or the card has been revoked.\" ReutersMaduro appears livid but doesn't acknowledge the misshap, pauses for a second and then grabs his wife's ID card for scanning.Social media was abuzz with the misshap, which fanned the flames of speculation about the place of birth of the socialist president, whose mother is rumored to be a Colombian national. Following an opposition-mandated special commission investigation into the matter, the socialist-majority Supreme Court issued a ruling last October that stated that Maduro had been born in Caracas in 1962, but did not produce a birth certificate.Some opposition leaders continue to sustain that they have proof that Maduro was born a Colombian national, which would make him constitutionally ineligible to occupy the presidency.Maduro's highly vocal critic and former president of Colombia ridiculed Maduro in a tweet that reads: \"My fellow countryman, didn't they let you vote?\"Paisano \u00bf No te dejaron votar? https://t.co/ouVWI4eMtS \u2014 Andr\u00e9s Pastrana A (@AndresPastrana_) July 30, 2017Despite that hiccup, the opposition is boycotting Sunday's vote, contending the election has been structured to ensure Maduro's socialist party continues to dominate. So all 5,500 candidates for the 545 seats in the constituent assembly are his supporters and the vote's success is being measured by turnout.The government is encouraging participation with tactics that include offering social benefits like subsidized food to the poor and threatening state workers' jobs if they don't vote.\"I'm here because I'm hoping for housing,\" said Luisa Marquez, a 46-year-old hairdresser.Others said they were there out of conviction that the constitutional assembly would help the government fend off what they called an international capitalist conspiracy to undermine Venezuela's socialist system with the help of the domestic opposition.\"The crisis, the shortages of food and medicine, that isn't the government's fault,\" said Luis Osuna, a 42-year-old private bodyguard. \"Those who are attacking us to kill us with hunger and blame the government are the same enemies the government's always had.\"Women shout slogans during a protest held by Venezuelans in Spain against Venezuela's Constituent Assembly election, in Madrid, Spain, on July 30, 2017.

Inflation and homicide rates are among the world's highest and widespread shortages of food and medicine have citizens dying of preventable illnesses and rooting through trash to feed themselves.The special assembly being selected Sunday will have powers to rewrite the country's 1999 constitution but will also have powers above and beyond other state institutions, including the opposition-controlled congress.While opinion polls say a vast majority oppose him, Maduro made clear in a televised address Saturday evening that he intends to use the assembly to govern without limitation, describing the vote as \"the election of a power that's above and beyond every other.\"He said he wants the assembly to strip opposition legislators of their constitutional immunity from prosecution and indicated he eager to prosecute many more members of the opposition parties that control a handful of state governments along with the National Assembly, providing one of the few remaining checks on the power of the socialist party that has ruled this OPEC nation for nearly two decades.\"The right wing already has its prison cell waiting,\" the president said. \"All the criminals will go to prison for the crimes they've committed.\"Saying the assembly will begin to govern within a week, Maduro said its first task in rewriting the constitution will be \"a total transformation\" of the office of Venezuela's chief prosecutor, a former government loyalist who has become the highest-ranking official to publicly split from the president.The Trump administration has imposed successive rounds of sanctions on high-ranking members of Maduro's administration, with the support of countries including Mexico, Colombia and Panama. Vice President Mike Pence promised on Friday that the U.S. would take \"strong and swift economic actions\" if the vote went ahead. He didn't say whether the U.S. would sanction Venezuelan oil imports, a measure with the potential to undermine Maduro but cause an even deeper humanitarian crisis here.Maduro's supporters on the Supreme Court set off the protests and clashes between police and demonstrator when they tried to strip the National Assembly of its powers in April. Most of the dead have been protesters apparently shot by police and government-linked paramilitaries.The opposition has organized a series of work stoppages as well as a July 16 protest vote that it said drew more than 7.5 million symbolic votes against the constitutional assembly.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle burn <extra_id_0> Artifact barricade <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle detonated <extra_id_0> Artifact motorcycles <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle burn <extra_id_0> Artifact Motorcycles <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Counting civilian casualties in CIA\u2019s drone warA report released in September by human rights researchers at Stanford Law School and New York University Law School sets out to demonstrate that U.S. drone policies are \"damaging and counterproductive.\"Media outlets from CNN to BBC hailed the report as new evidence of the U.S. government\u2019s false narrative on drones and the New York Times\u2018 Scott Shane described the study as \"among the most thorough on the subject to date.\"While the Stanford-NYU report certainly presents a comprehensive review of existing drone research, its new contributions to the evidentiary record are far more modest than its sweeping conclusions would suggest.Number CrunchingThe U.S. government claims that civilian casualties caused by drones are in the \"single digits\" during Obama\u2019s years in office, while the Stanford-NYU report seeks to establish that there is significant evidence that U.S. drone strikes have killed and injured a larger number of civilians. This is a low bar, and would merely necessitate proving that more than 10 civilians have been killed by drones since Obama assumed office, a claim that has been made by all three major databases aggregating information on drone strikes. The Stanford-NYU report goes further, claiming that between 474 and 881 civilians have been killed since 2004.However, this does not represent new evidence. Stanford and NYU researchers made no attempt to offer new statistical analysis on the number of civilian casualties caused by drones. Rather, their report is essentially an extended endorsement of a database compiled by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a small team of journalists based out of City University, London. In doing so, the report rejects the findings of two other widely cited databases, The Long War Journal, which reports 138 civilian deaths and New America Foundation\u2019s Year of the Drone, which lists 152-191 civilian deaths and the deaths of 130-268 \"unknowns.\"If the Stanford-NYU team wants to paint a picture of the U.S. as a human rights abuser, then the Bureau, whose casualty statistics dwarf the more conservative estimates of the other databases, is best suited to that purpose, but that does not make it the most reliable source.While a comprehensive assessment of the Bureau\u2019s data should have been conducted before giving it a resounding endorsement, just a cursory review of its account of 2012\u2019s drone strikes reveals problems:\u2013 On May 5, 2012 the Bureau reports that a strike in North Waziristan killed 8-10 people, of whom between zero and ten are listed as civilians. Upon reviewing the accompanying sources one find that early reports said the identity of the dead could not be determined, but subsequent reports from government officials identified them as militants. Of the 15 sources cited by the Bureau, not one states that the victims were civilians.-On June 2, 2012 the Bureau reports that 2-4 people were killed and between zero and two of them were civilians. These civilian deaths were inferred based on a report that a motorbike was accidentally hit, but the Bureau fails to take note of a later report from The Express Tribune identifying the motorbike victims as suspected militants Khalil Yargul Khail and Rehmanullah Gangi Khail.-On July 23, 2012 the Bureau references 25 sources for a drone strike, only one of which described the victims as local residents and based on this the Bureau reports that up to 14 civilians were killed.The Stanford-NYU report critiques the Long War Journal for not making its data available in a verifiable strike-by-strike format, over-relying on U.S. intelligence sources, and identifying all victims as militants unless they are specifically identified as civilians. These are reasonable criticisms, but when the critique turns to New America Foundation research, it becomes logically inconsistent.While Stanford-NYU researchers admit that all three databases rely on \"the same universe of publicly available press reports,\" they criticize only the New America Foundation for over-relying on the anonymous Pakistani government officials cited in such news reports. The Stanford-NYU report laments that these officials are cited in 88% of articles referenced in New America\u2019s 2012 data but fails to consider that these same articles are referenced by the Bureau. Furthermore, the only reason the researchers were able to generate that statistic is because New America compiles a highly transparent summary of media sources relied on for each strike with a list of which sources reported which casualty estimates, something no other database provides.The Stanford-NYU report goes on to question the \"deep reporting\" capabilities of New America\u2019s sources (The New York Times, Reuters, AP, BBC, etc.) while uncritically accepting the veracity of reports from fringe outlets such as the Kuwait News Agency, the South Asian News Agency, Central Asia Online, and Punjab News, which are sometimes the sole sources for the Bureau\u2019s reports of civilian casualties.This is not to suggest that the Bureau\u2019s research is without merit, but it should be noted that it represents an interpretation of the facts with a bias toward reporting civilian casualties. The Bureau\u2019s database does not even have a category for reporting militant deaths. It seems counter-intuitive that the organization\u2019s researchers can have such absolute faith in their civilian casualty estimates, but not have the confidence to label any of the deceased as militants.And the Stanford-NYU team was not impartial. By the report\u2019s own admission, the research project it undertook in Pakistan to interview family members of drone strike victims was commissioned by Reprieve, a UK based advocacy organization. Reprieve, which filed two lawsuits on behalf of alleged drone victims in May of 2012, arranged, paid for and collaborated on many of the victim interviews conducted by the Stanford-NYU researchers.No database is perfect, but a strong argument could be made that the New America Foundation\u2019s policy of attempting to identify both militants and civilians while maintaining an explicit category for \"unknowns\" to represent the uncertainty surrounding many of the strikes is a more balanced representation of the facts. After all, if the public is to assess the efficacy of drone strikes then we need to consider the strikes that hit their targets as well as the ones that do not.Stanford and NYU\u2019s analysis of the three drone databases, in some respects, misses the forest for the trees. A comparison of the annual data collected by the Bureau with that compiled by the New America Foundation suggests that while their numbers may differ, their underlying findings are substantially similar. Both the Bureau and New America have observed a general decline in the percentage of civilian fatalities since the high in 2006, with a sharp decrease during the Obama administration. According to the Bureau\u2019s data, the proportion of civilians killed in drone strikes fell from 35 percent in 2008 under President Bush to 9 percent thus far in 2012. Similarly, New America reports that the rate of civilian and unknown casualties decreased from 23 percent in 2008 to 2 percent in 2012. This stands to reason when we consider that the Bureau tends to err on the side of assuming that unidentified dead or individuals of disputed identity are civilians, while New America prefers to accommodate ambiguity by listing \"unknowns\" and only reports a civilian or militant casualty when it is reported by two independent sources.If one takes the average number of civilian and unknown deaths counted by the New America Foundation from 2004-2012 as a percentage of the total number of people killed in drone strikes, the civilian and unknown deaths represent 15 percent of the total. The Bureau\u2019s data suggests that civilian deaths account for 22 percent of the total killed. These numbers are in fact, not so very far apart. And while the Bureau has criticized New America for reporting that in 2012, civilian deaths are approaching zero, the Bureau\u2019s own data suggests that the percentage of civilian casualties in 2012 is at nine percent, an all-time low and significantly less than the 23 percent the Bureau reports during Obama\u2019s first year in office. This suggests that the choice is not between two very different data sets, but rather two different interpretations of similar evidence. Contrary to the Stanford-NYU report\u2019s claims, the New America Foundation is not underreporting civilian casualties; its researchers have simply chosen not to feign certainty in the face of ambiguity.What They Didn\u2019t SayThe Stanford-NYU researchers also fail to incorporate evidence that might temper their claims. Their report makes numerous references to an AP investigative report that interviewed 80 villagers at the sites of the ten deadliest attacks in 2011 and 2012 but neglects its conclusions that \"a significant majority of the dead were combatants\" and the numbers of casualties gathered by AP investigators \"turned out to be very close to those given by Pakistani intelligence on the day of each strike.\"Numerous media accounts, including the LA Times, have highlighted that \"the [Stanford-NYU] study concludes that only about 2 percent of drone casualties are top militant leaders.\" The study reached no such conclusion. This claim is based on research conducted by New America and published last month on CNN. While the Stanford-NYU report summarily dismissed New America\u2019s militant and civilian casualty estimates, they have been quick to make this statistic a centerpiece of their argument. In doing so, they also take the conclusion out of context, and ignore the possible tactical utility of deliberately targeting low-level militants. Indeed, destroying communication centers, training camps and vehicles undermines the operational effectiveness of al-Qaeda and the Taliban, and quotes from operatives of the Pakistan-based Haqqani Network reveal that drones have forced them into a \"jungle existence\" where they fear for the lives on a daily basis.A second key contention of the Stanford-NYU report is that drone strikes are \"damaging and counterproductive\" to U.S. national security. However, it is shortsighted to evaluate U.S. security in isolation from Pakistani domestic order. Terrorist attacks have been a pervasive problem in Pakistan, especially since 2007. While the report references these attacks and the frequent assassinations carried out by Taliban forces, it makes no reference to recent research by an analyst at the RAND Corporation, who identifies a negative correlation between drone strikes and militant violence inside Pakistan, indicating that the rate of violence has gone down as the rate of drone strikes has gone up. Analysis by New America suggests that while only 10 percent of drone strikes target al-Qaeda operatives, approximately 50 percent hit Taliban targets and in 2009, 19 of the first 32 drone strikes targeted the organization of Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban who was ultimately responsible for the deaths of thousands of Pakistanis, and the alleged mastermind of the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Mehsud was a far greater threat to Pakistani security than that of the United States.Key FindingsThese criticisms are not to suggest that the Stanford-NYU report is without merit. The anecdotal evidence on the adverse mental health impact of drones, the economic hardships created by attacks and the restriction of movement caused by FATA residents\u2019 anxiety about potential strikes are all valuable contributions to the public\u2019s understanding of drones, as is the report\u2019s succinct and cogent summary of some of the key legal issues. Both of these topics merit further research and the teams at Stanford and NYU seem well poised to continue contributing in these areas.However it would be a mistake to unequivocally accept all of the report\u2019s conclusions or its stance on the civilian casualty debate. The U.S. government\u2019s claims that civilian casualties from drone strikes during Obama\u2019s term in office are in the single digits are manifestly untrue, but there is no need to overstate the rate of civilian deaths to make the point that drones strikes are legally suspect and morally hazardous.Meg Braun is a Rhodes Scholar and MPhil candidate in International Relations at Oxford, where she is researching the evolution of U.S. drone policy.

But the committee issued a statement saying no evidence has been uncovered linking the group to the bombing that killed 14 people and left dozens more injured.Russian investigators have identified 22-year-old Kyrgyz-born Akbarzhon Dzhalilov as the suicide bomber who carried out the attack.A house in Osh, Kyrgyzstan, belonging to the parents of a man believed to be behind Monday's blast on a subway in St. Petersburg, Russia, April 4, 2017.World leaders from China to Europe to Brazil expressed their condolences over the tragedy. U.S. President Donald Trump phoned Russian President Vladimir Putin and offered full support in responding to the attack.Politicizing the bombingRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the global outpouring Russia received reflected a common understanding of the need to join efforts to fight terrorism instead of trying, according to him, to \u201cuse extremists to reach narrow geopolitical goals.\u201d\"With regard to the argument made by some media that the attack is revenge against Russia for our policy in Syria... [this is] cynical, cowardly,\" said Lavrov, who went on to point a finger at the previous U.S. administration. \"Sadly, this is not just a media fabrication: certain figures, including representatives of Obama administration\u2019s Pentagon, have shared similar thoughts with the world community.\u201dCity on edgeThe attack has left St. Petersburg residents on edge.St. Petersburg emergency services responded Tuesday morning to a bomb threat at a subway station near Monday\u2019s deadly blast on a train as it was passing between two stations. After receiving an anonymous call, police went to clear pedestrians from the area.Blast victims lie near a subway train hit by a explosion at the Tekhnologichesky Institut subway station in St.Petersburg, Russia, April 3, 2017.Reporters on the scene said fire trucks and ambulances quickly arrived. Authorities briefly closed subway stations. They searched for an unattended item before re-opening the stations.

But he added that ETA remained the ''main line of investigation.''He said more than 220 pounds of dynamite packed into backpacks had been used in the attacks.Arnaldo Otegi, leader of Batasuna, ETA's political wing, which has been banned in Spain, said ETA probably was not behind the attacks. He said the attack could have been the work of ''Arab resistance.''Another senior Spanish official said in an interview that the bombs used titadine, a kind of compressed dynamite found in a van containing 1,100 pounds of explosives that was intercepted last month as it headed for Madrid. Two suspected ETA members were arrested at the time.The official added that the government believed that the dynamite was stolen from France three years ago. ''This material has a kind of signature on it,'' the official said.On Dec. 24, the police foiled a plot that would have detonated two bombs in a train after it arrived at a Madrid station. They seized a man with a bomb in San Sebasti\u00e1n, a Basque city. He had a ticket for the train, and when the police halted the train and searched it, they found a second bomb.The letter claiming responsibility for the attack on Thursday was delivered to Al Quds Al Arabi, a London-based Arab newspaper.

{"text": "DJI responds to drone attacks: \u201cWe have limited ability to control what people do with our products\u201dThe world\u2019s largest drone manufacturer, DJI, has issued a statement after two of their drones armed with explosives were used in an apparent assassination attempt against Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro last week.The drones in question appeared to be Matrice 600s; commercial-level UAVs intended for aerial photography and costing around $5000 each.The Venezuelan government claims that each Matrice was packed with a kilo of C4 and were intended to kill Maduro and other important Venezuelan political figures.https://www.wetalkuav.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1024x576_MP4_4439375926361635711.mp4A video of the drone exploding from media at the eventDJI spoke with Dezeen magazine and told them that \"DJI makes products purely for peaceful purposes.\"\"While we build some prudent safety and security features into our products, we have limited ability to control what people do with them.\"They stated that the overwhelming majority of DJI drone operators use their drones peacefully, and they \"deplore any use of our products to bring harm to anyone.\"\"As with any technology, if people decide to misuse our products in any way, they have to be responsible for their actions,\" they said.Two DJI Matrice 600\u2019s were seemingly used in an attack against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela last week.Who was responsible for the drone attacks and why did they fail?It is, as yet, unclear who exactly was reponsible for the attacks.One group calling themselves \u2018Soldiers in T-shirts\u2018 claimed responsibility on Twitter.Maduro alleged Venezuela\u2019s ultra-right in alliance with Colombia\u2019s ultra-right and their outgoing president, Juan Manuel Santos were behind the assassination attempt.The Venezuelan government has used the attacks as justification for a further crackdown on political opponents and have arrested at least 6 people.Neither drone ultimately made it to their intended targets.According to Venezuela\u2019s Attorney General, this was because they were deflected from reaching their intended course through protective radio emissions eminating from Venzuelan intelligence personnel (similar to drone killing devices we\u2019ve written about previously).Video footage from multiple angles since the attack suggest that one drone exploded above the soldiers on parade (causing 7 injuries) while the other crashed into the window of an apartment, causing the apartment to catch fire (this was initially reported in some outlets as the result of gas explosion).The website Bellingcat has an excellent rundown of all evidence related to the drone attack including video footage and photos from multiple angles, if you\u2019re interested.A soldier injured by the exploding drone at the Venezualan National Guard celebration parade in CaracasDespite some claims in media, it seems unlikely the government would stage an attack against itself.As the Economist noted, \"Dictators depend on projecting an image of omnipotence\u2026 in the television footage, Mr Maduro looked befuddled; the massed ranks of the National Guard broke discipline and ran off in panic.\"In essence, the attacks made Maduro look weak, not strong.False flag operations have happened throughout history but thus far, this does not appear to be one of them.Story continues on page 2", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble armed <extra_id_0> Artifact drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime assassination <extra_id_0> Victim president <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble packed <extra_id_0> Artifact Matrice <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components C4 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack kill <extra_id_0> Target Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice C4 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploding <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target Nicol\u00e1s Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument Matrice 600\u2019s <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument other <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim soldier <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploding <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target soldier <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker government <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

Three people died-one a mother of seven, another a boy of 14.News Headlines on the Day The three year bloodbath in Ulster reached a new level of savagery when terrorists unleashed a -killer blitz of stunning ferocity. This city has not experienced such a day of death and destruction since the German blitz of 1941. With the callous lack of remorse now so typical of the Provos they audaciously accept responsibility for what was an operation clearly requiring considerable planning and manpower. Throughout the 32 counties Irish men and women should ponder how a virulent Nazi-style disregard for life can lodge In the hearts of our fellow countrymen; all the more virulent in that once again the Innocent have been the main sufferers. Hitler In his Berlin bunker decided that the German people were no longer worthy of him and deserved not to survive. Yesterday's dead and injured and testimony to something similarly rotten in our philosophy of life. Every Irishman and woman must stand appalled and ashamed at the horror of what was perpetuated In Belfast yesterday In the name of Irish unity. Belfast is rocked and racked by the most ferocious blitz yet mounted by the IRA. Not even the German bombs could inflict more devastation on the capital of Ulster in the last war. On this unforgettable day 26 bombs, borne by car and planted to take the greatest toll of life, shattered the bodies of men, women and children in a fiendish holocaust of murder and hate. The wanton killing of non-combatant men, women and children-the inevitable consequence of exploding so many bombs without adequate warning - is yet another cruel act which will not be forgotten.A wanton attack on innocent men,women and childrenTHE FOLLOWING STATEMENT WAS MADE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND, MR. WILLIAM WHITELAW, IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, 24 JULY 1972:- As the House will know, the City and people of Belfast suffered a murderous sequence of explosions last Friday. Most of the 27 explosions in Belfast that day occurred within a 3\u00bd hour period in the afternoon-at a time when, and at places where high civilian casualties must have been expected and intended. No adequate warnings were given. Seven civilians and two soldiers were killed and at least 130 civilians injured-many gravely. I hardly need point out that all sections of the community are indiscriminately affected by these outrages. Of the dead two were Roman Catholics. Of the 130 injured at least 40 were Roman Catholics. 53 were men and boys, 77 women and children. I am sure the whole House will wish to join with me in expressing sympathy to the families of all those involved in this wanton attack on innocent men, women and children. After the appallingly bloodthirsty and criminal events of last Friday, there cannot be any remaining shred of support for the men who perpetrate them. Even those sectors of Roman Catholic opinion throughout the world which have traditionally identified themselves with and perhaps given the benefit of the doubt to any group of men who claimed to speak for the Irish Republican movement can surely no longer continue to uphold the men who were responsible for Friday's horrible catalogue of slaughter. Supporters of the Republican movement in this country, in Northern Ireland, in the United States and elsewhere, will no doubt notice the revulsion in some circles in the Irish Republic. Since Parliament at the end of March entrusted the Government with complete responsibility for all administration in Northern Ireland, we have made the most patient and reasoned effort to secure the end of violence. No one can deny that Her Majesty's Government have now an absolutely unchallengeable right to ask this House, this country, and indeed the whole world for their support in an absolute determination to destroy the capacity of the IRA for further acts of inhumanity. They have degraded the human race, and it must now be clear to all that their sole object is to promote their aims by violence and by violence alone.DESTRUCTION In Oxford Street bus station where death came to six people and scores were injured. The station was crowded when the bomb exploded. It was the worst of the afternoon's 19 murderous bombings.DESTRUCTION at Smithfield bus station, scene of the first of the vicious series of attacks on innocent people. Mercifully the buses here seen ablaze had not started filling up with passengers.DESTRUCTION in York Road railway terminus where the bomb was in an innocent-looking suitcase left on the platform.Letters to the Editor Funeral with no shouted commandsbut only sobs of four small childrenTO-DAY (Monday) I went to a funeral-that of one of \"Bloody Friday's\" victims. It wasn't one of those funerals we know so well in Belfast, with the uniformed men, the ceremonial shots, the shouted commands, the graveside oration. The only uniforms were the black and white vestments of the clergy. The only arms were those of Christ crucified on the Cross which led the Cortege. No shouted commands- only the sobbing of four small children. No graveside oration, only the tears in the eyes of a husband as final tribute. If there is power in the sobs of children and the tears of husbands and fathers, wives and mothers then the cause espoused by the terrorist is on the point of death: its followers now are but walking. dead, animated husks, soulless and mindless. rejected and disowned by any creature capable of pity and compassion. The earth which thudded on that coffin covered only a body, not the bestial deed which sent it there, an ever-pointing finger of condemnation to all involved - the terrorists who planned the bombing campaign, the terrorists who made the bombs, the terrorists who planted them: the politicians who wouldn't talk until all their demands were met and the politicians who talked too much and too often said the wrong thing; the leading churchmen, who merely mouthed pious attitudes. condemning violence in general but never aiming at specific deeds and organisations: The trade unionists who permitted discrimination to be the unwritten rule in our industrial life and the industrialists and businessmen who bowed to this evil on their premises; the neighbours, who were true neighbours and friends-until intimidation entered their street. To-day's victim had the dignity and honour of innocence and motherhood to take to her grave and Maker, and leaves her legacy of a peace-loving, and In the course of time, happy family. Her killers will face their Maker with her blood and many others on their hands and can only leave a. their legacy hatred, sorrow and despair.A FACE IN THE CROWD,Belfast 13.DESTRUCTION In Botanic Avenue after a bomb exploded in a hi-jacked bread van parked outside the York Hotel. Cars and houses suffered in the blast and there were the inevitable casualties.DESTRUCTION at the busy Antrim Road-Limeston Road corner. The wreckage in the forefront is all that was left of the stolen van in which the bomb had been planted. Women shoppers were among the casualties.DESTRUCTION at the shopping centre on the Cavehill Road, where one of the last of the bombs killed three people, including a mother of seven and a boy of 14.REPORTS 'Streets swept by terror' \"Such warnings as were given were so vague and imprecise as to be almost useless; For much of the afternoon Belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic. Girls and men wept openly, hugging each other for safety in the main streets as plumes of smoke rose around them and dull thuds echoed from wall to wall. It was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe As each bomb exploded there were cries of terror from people who thought they had found sanctuary but in fact were just as exposed as before. Report in the Guardian.'A day of horror and shame' Friday, July 21, 1972, was a day of horror and shame in this stricken city. Even hardened newsmen recoiled with shock from the scenes of carnage witnessed in Belfast as firemen lifted the mangled bodies where bombs ripped through crowds of unsuspecting men, women and children at bus depots and other locations. In all my years of journalism, which included the worst days of the wartime blitzes, I have never seen scenes so horrible in this city and one felt a deep feeling of anger and shame that such deeds were planned and carried out by fellow Irishmen. All Ireland has been shamed by the events of this terrible July afternoon in Belfast. Report in the Irish Independent, Dublin.'A deed of sick men' \"The chief injury is not to the British Army, to the Establishment or to big business but to the plain people of Belfast and Ireland. Anyone who supports violence from any s i d e after yesterday's events is sick with the same affliction as those who did the deed. \"Can anyone now believe that anything worth while can be established by these methods? That the country of anyone's vision can live with more memories of this kind?\" \"Irish Times\", Dublin. 'The cold-blooded, co-ordinated bomb outrages are a shocking crime against an already innocent population who have already suffered too much. These were brutal murders which will be totally condemned by every decent person in the United Kingdom.'Mr. Harold Wilson, Leader of the OppositionTHE BOMBERS STRIKE - AND THIS IS SOME OF THE SUFFERING THEY LEFTScenes of anguish in Oxford Street Bus Station where six people died - as pictured in the Daily Express \"A black sin ... that will never be erased\" By the Editor of theSunday IndependentDublin These are dark days for Ireland. We live in an age of cowardice, with the guilt spread evenly between the highest and the lowest in the land. We fostered the men who planned the murders of innocent men, women, boys and girls in Belfast on Friday. We fed these people with propaganda. We took advantage, when we could, of their exploits. And because we are not a morally courageous people, we never seriously tried to stop their terrible excesses. Those among us who could have acted to halt the course of tragedy preferred to do nothing. Those who could have spoken out, when words might have meant something, chose to hold their tongues. And the rest of us were content to let matters slide. Now all of us must pay the price for this neglect. There is a black sin on the face of Irish Republicanism today that will never be erased. Murder now lies at the feet of the Irish nation and there is no gain-saying that fact. We cannot change past, however much we regret its record. But if we wish to restore the honour of our people, now is the time to act. We must break the paralysis that leaves the good name of the Irish people in the hands of unscrupulous men. And we must find a way to make restitution for our failings. The gallantry of those who planted bombs in the middle of Belfast's shopping areas on Friday (and then ran like hell) will be sanctified by the almighty god of Irish republicanism and reverently embalmed- in what we are pleased to call our national heritage.

{"text": "On 27 August 1975 a Provisional IRA bomb exploded without warning at the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey, England. There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured, some severely. Two off-duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing.==Background==In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven \"incident centres\" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit (ASU) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang (due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974.==The bombing==The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9:20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off-duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign (Phase Two) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people.==Aftermath==One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a \"carbon copy\" of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences. The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street. The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which, along with the bombings, caused the deaths of nearly 20 people, injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property.==See also==*Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1970\u201379)== References ==", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Caterham Arms public house <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caterham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Instrument bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place England <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> Attacker IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Oxford Street <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Injurer people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle blew <extra_id_0> Artifact roof <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place pub <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer unit <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim hundreds <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injurer unit <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle damage <extra_id_0> Artifact property <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Damager unit <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure lost <extra_id_0> Victim soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassination <extra_id_0> Target Edward Heath <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Their <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack threw <extra_id_0> Attacker attackers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice a bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place bedroom <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Victim Some <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure losing <extra_id_0> Victim soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble planted <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler Balcombe Street Gang <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place house <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection monitor <extra_id_0> Observer centres <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble placed <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Research charge <extra_id_0> Researcher officers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentences <extra_id_0> Defendant people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain caught <extra_id_0> Detainee they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Balcombe Street <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact agreed <extra_id_0> Participant Northern Ireland Office <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "There were ten times more air strikes in the covert war on terror during President Barack Obama\u2019s presidency than under his predecessor, George W. Bush.Obama embraced the US drone programme, overseeing more strikes in his first year than Bush carried out during his entire presidency. A total of 563 strikes, largely by drones, targeted Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen during Obama\u2019s two terms, compared to 57 strikes under Bush. Between 384 and 807 civilians were killed in those countries, according to reports logged by the Bureau.The use of drones aligned with Obama\u2019s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable, costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia. But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism.The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so \u201cexceptionally surgical and precise\u201d that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting \u201cinnocent men, women and children in danger\u201d. This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups, however, and the Bureau\u2019s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case.The White House released long-awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data. However the US\u2019s estimate of the number of civilians killed \u2013 between 64 and 116 \u2013 contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at 380 to 801 was six times higher.That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan \u2013 where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014. The country has since come under frequent US bombardment, in an unreported war that saw 1,337 weapons dropped last year alone \u2013 a 40% rise on 2015.Afghan civilian casualties have been high, with the United Nations (UN) reporting at least 85 deaths in 2016. The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period. We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015.Pakistan was the hub of drone operations during Obama\u2019s first term. The pace of attacks had accelerated in the second half of 2008 at the end of Bush\u2019s term, after four years pocked by occasional strikes. However in the year after taking office, Obama ordered more drone strikes than Bush did during his entire presidency. The 54 strikes in 2009 all took place in Pakistan.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack strikes  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strikes  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strikes <extra_id_0> Instrument drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Yemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strikes  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place countries <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strikes <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strikes <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths <extra_id_0> Place battlefields <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker US <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Afghanistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombardment <extra_id_0> Attacker US <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target country <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice weapons <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths <extra_id_0> Victim 85 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths <extra_id_0> Victim civilian <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strikes <extra_id_0> Place Pakistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strikes <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strikes  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Accused Boston Bomber Followed Brother's Lead, Defense Argues BOSTON \u2014\u00a0Accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev followed his older brother's lead in carrying out the 2013 bombing that killed three people, rather than acting on his own motivation, one of his attorneys argued on Monday.Tsarnaev, 21, could be sentenced to death if a jury finds him guilty of carrying out the April 15, 2013, attack and fatally shooting a police officer three days later as he and his brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, tried to flee the city.Following the prosecution's closing argument, that the ethnic Chechen defendant was an extremist who had \"wanted to punish America\" with the bombing attack, Tsarnaev's lawyers argued that he had been in the thrall of his older brother.Defense attorney Judith Clarke, who opened the trial last month by admitting that her client had committed all the crimes of which he is accused, repeated that assertion on Monday.\"There is no excuse. No one is trying to make one. Planting bombs at the Boston Marathon one year and 51 weeks ago was a senseless act,\" Clarke said.But in a counterpoint to the blunt \"it was him\" admission of her opening statement, Clarke told the jury that Tamerlan, who died four days after the bombing following a gunfight with police, had planned the attack and built the bombs.\"Tamerlan did that,\" she said. \"We need to understand who was leading and who was following.\"By shifting some of the blame to the older brother, Tsarnaev's lawyers are trying to persuade the jury, if they find the defendant guilty, to sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of parole rather than death.The jury on Monday also viewed video of Tsarnaev standing with a backpack in the crowd at the marathon's finish line minutes before the blasts that killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, 23, and 8-year-old Martin Richard.Tsarnaev is also accused of the fatal shooting of Massachusetts of Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, 26.'Wanted to Punish America'Prosecutors argued that the younger Tsarnaev shared his brother's violent ideology.\"The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahedeen, the holy warriors,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. \"He wanted to terrorize this country. He wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people.\"Chakravarty noted that evidence showed that Tsarnaev, who moved to the United States from Russia a decade before the attack, had copies of al-Qaida's \"Inspire\" magazine on his computers.\"These were political choices,\" he said of Tsarnaev's actions. \"He was making a statement, 'an eye for an eye.'\"Hours after the gunfight with police, which ended when Dzhokhar sped off in a car, running his brother over in the process, the defendant hid in a boat parked in a backyard. While there, he wrote a note suggesting the attack was an act of retribution for U.S. military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries.Monday's closing statements could be a preview of the arguments each side plans to make during the next phase of the trial, when the same jury will hear a fresh round of witness testimony before determining whether to sentence Tsarnaev to life in prison without possibility of parole, or to death.Richard's parents, William and Denise; dancer Heather Abbott, who lost both legs in the blast, and former Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis were among the people who packed the courtroom for closing arguments.The defendant sat quietly in court on Monday, dressed in a white shirt, dark jacket and no tie.

{"text": "Police in the city of Lyon were searching for a man believed to be responsible for a Friday blast which injured several people. The explosion targeted a bakery on the central street Rue Victor Hugo, in what French President Emmanuel Macron called an \"attack.\"\"It's not for me to give a toll but it appears there are no casualties,\" said Macron. \"There have been injuries, so obviously I'm thinking of these injured and their families.\" None of the injuries were life-threatening but 11 people were taken to hospital. There were eight women, a 10-year-old girl and four men injured.The man was caught on surveillance video dropping off a package near the bakery. Police described him as a European or North African male in his early 30s, wearing beige Bermuda shorts, an army-green scarf or head wrap and dark glasses. He left the scene on a mountain bicycle.Police have urged people to avoid the area.

{"text": "July 29, 2011 \u0097 -- When Army Pfc. Naser Jason Abdo, accused of plotting planning a deadly bombing and shooting attack on soldiers at Fort Hood, made his first appearance in court in Waco, Texas, today, he yelled the name of accused Fort Hood shooter Major Nidal Hasan.Hasan is facing the death penalty for allegedly killing 13 people and wounding more than 30 in an assault on Fort Hood in November 2009.Like Hasan, Abdo may have taken some of his inspiration from Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical American-born Islamic cleric who is among the leaders of the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). One senior U.S. official told ABC News that after Abdo was arrested at a Killeen, Texas hotel Wednesday, Abdo mentioned the name of al-Awlaki.Nidal Hasan had exchanged emails with Awlaki, according to U.S. authorities. Al-Awlaki is believed to have inspired several other terror plots in the U.S. as well, including the bungled Christmas Day underwear bombing of Northwest flight 253.According to senior law enforcement officials, when police searched Abdo's hotel room, in addition to firearms, ammunition and bomb-making materials, they also found an article from a jihadi magazine produced by al-Awlaki's organization, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.The officials told ABC News Abdo had apparently stashed in the room an article from the first issue of al Qaeda's \"Inspire\" magazine called \"How to Build a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.\"AQAP, a media-savvy affiliate of al Qaeda, has produced six issues of \"Inspire\" so far, each featuring praise for martyrs and instructional sections on firearms and explosives for the prospective terrorist.Abdo was charged Friday with the federal crime of possession of a non-registered firearm in addition to previous charges of possession of child pornography and going AWOL from his unit. As he was being led from the courtroom, he yelled out, \"Nidal Hasan!\", \"Fort Hood!\", and \"2009!\".READ: Soldier Arrested in Alleged Fort Hood PlotAbdo Went AWOL July 4Abdo, a Muslim soldier who was in the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell more than 800 miles away in Kentucky, attempted to leave the military in 2010 after protesting the U.S.'s involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.In August 2010 he told ABC News he should not have to participate in what he called an \"unjust war\".\"Any Muslim who knows his religion or maybe takes into account what his religion says can find out very clearly why he should not participate in the U.S. military,\" Abdo said then.READ: Devout Muslim Hopes to Avoid Deployment to AfghanistanThe Army approved Abdo's request to be discharged as a conscientious objector, but just days later the discharge was put on hold and he was charged with having child pornography on his government-issued computer. Military investigators had been looking at Abdo's computer files after he made \"radical statements,\" law enforcement sources told ABC News.After he was told he would face a court martial, Abdo went AWOL from Fort Campbell on July 4. Though vocal in his protestations against the mission in the Middle East, Abdo did not make any public threats against the military.But when he was discovered Wednesday, Abdo was apparently in the final planning stages of a deadly attack. He was caught in part because a wary local gun store owner called police after Abdo visited the store to buy ammunition and gunpowder. He was acting \"suspicious,\" Guns Galore owner Greg Ebert told ABC News.\"There was clearly something wrong with him,\" Ebert said. \"We made a decision to call the police and fortunately it worked out.\"After his arrest, Abdo admitted he planned to plant two bombs at a local restaurant frequented by Fort Hood soldiers and hoped to gun down any survivors of the dual blast, according to law enforcement documents obtained by ABC News.According to the documents, military officials believe the incident \"was likely isolated to the Fort Hood area and the suspect in custody, and that arrest of the suspect has mitigated any further threats related to this incident.\"Abdo's former lawyer, James M. Branum, declined to comment for an ABC News report except to say Thursday he hasn't spoken with his client \"in a long time.\"ABC News' Sarah Netter, Luis Martinez and Lee Ferran contributed to this report.Click Here for the Blotter Homepage.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker Naser Jason Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Fort Hood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact emails <extra_id_0> Participant Nidal Hasan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection searched <extra_id_0> Observer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place room <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation led <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin courtroom <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain Arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Soldier <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Fort Hood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation Went <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation Deployment <extra_id_0> Destination Afghanistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Muslim <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> EndPosition discharged <extra_id_0> Employee Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PlaceOfEmployment Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection looking <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Observer investigators <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict face <extra_id_0> Defendant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation went <extra_id_0> Transporter Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin Fort Campbell <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact protestations <extra_id_0> Communicator his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce threats <extra_id_0> Communicator Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient military <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell buy <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity gunpowder <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Giver Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact called <extra_id_0> Participant owner <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant Greg Ebert <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact call <extra_id_0> Participant We <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact say <extra_id_0> Participant ABC News <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact spoken <extra_id_0> Participant client <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place hotel <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant ABC News <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target flight 253 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument underwear <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime possession  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime AWOL <extra_id_0> Perpetrator his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime pornography <extra_id_0> Victim child <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation going  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact yelled out <extra_id_0> Communicator he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic 2009 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime AWOL <extra_id_0> Perpetrator Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protesting <extra_id_0> Target U.S <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Afghanistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrator Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack war  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> EndPosition discharge  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime pornography <extra_id_0> Perpetrator his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime AWOL <extra_id_0> Perpetrator Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack gun down <extra_id_0> Target survivors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack plant <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place restaurant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain custody <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Investigators: NY Bombing Suspect Bought Parts on eBayFederal investigators say the suspect in Saturday's bombings in New York and New Jersey bought components on eBay and used as triggering devices cell phones purchased from a store 500 meters from an address he once listed as his home.The details are contained in criminal complaints made public Tuesday spelling out multiple federal charges against 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami. Most of the charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.Authorities arrested Rahami on Monday after an exchange of gunfire with police that left him and two officers wounded.According to the court documents, investigators believe Rahami used an eBay account with the username \"ahmad rahami\" to buy citric acid, a circuit board, electric igniters and hundreds of ball bearings between June 20 and August 10. The items were shipped to a business in Perth Amboy, New Jersey where Rahami worked until September 12.Ball bearings were found in two pressure cooker bombs placed four blocks apart in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York late Saturday. One of them exploded, injuring 29 people, while the other was recovered intact. Investigators said the second bomb had \"numerous\" electric igniters.Ahmad Khan Rahami is taken into custody after a shootout with police Monday, Sept. 19, 2016.That second device was tested for fingerprints, and the criminal complaint said all 12 prints found were matches for Rahami. The documents say his prints were also found on items inside of a backpack that was discovered late Sunday at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, just outside of New York. The bag contained multiple explosive devices, including one that blew up as police tried to disarm it with a robot.Authorities also tied Rahami to a bomb that blew up in a trash can in Seaside Park, New Jersey early Saturday.That link involved one of the cell phones that investigators said were shipped last year to a store in Perth Amboy near the address that Rahami provided as his home in a 2012 passport application. They said a second phone shipped to the same place was used in the bomb that blew up in Chelsea.A third phone, one found with the other Chelsea bomb, was once registered to one of Rahami's family members, the documents said.Investigators also said they used surveillance video to tie Rahami to the Chelsea bombs, with cameras putting him near the explosion site about 37 minutes before the blast and near where the other bomb was found two minutes after the first one went off. That second video, they said, showed him pulling a suitcase and then a short time later walking without it.The documents contain some pieces of writing from a journal found on Rahami when he was arrested. The messages include praise of American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011, and \"Brother Osama Bin Laden,\" the former head of al-Qaida who was killed by U.S. forces in Pakistan in 2011.\"Inshallah the sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets. Gun shots to your police. Death To Your OPPRESSION,\" one message reads.The FBI said Tuesday it assessed Rahami's activities in 2014 after his father told agents he was concerned about his son's possible involvement with extremists.The agency found insufficient evidence to warrant further investigation.Rahami was born in Afghanistan, came to the U.S. at age 7 and became a naturalized American citizen.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell bought <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity components <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell purchased <extra_id_0> Giver store <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity cell phones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime criminal  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentence  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer Authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell buy <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity circuit board <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation shipped <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact items <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination New Jersey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice them <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle recovered <extra_id_0> Artifact other <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain custody <extra_id_0> Detainee Ahmad Khan Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew up <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew up <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Seaside Park <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew up <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Chelsea <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack went off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Anwar al-Awlaki <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator agency <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle disarm <extra_id_0> Artifact it <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Unmanned aircraft primed specifically to chase and catch weaponised consumer drones will be taken for a spin in the coming months.Anti-drone unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are to be taken for counter-terrorist test flights on a UK military base, E&T has learned.It is understood they will be flown in exercises designed to simulate a real-life pursuit of a terrorist drone.Police and the military are believed to be concerned about the prospect of terrorists modifying small, off-the-shelf drones to launch attacks on British soil.Capturing drones using swarms of net-casting UAVs working in tandem is one of several options being considered by defence chiefs.Developing radio frequency denial systems to create a forcefield-type wall around government sensitive areas could also form part of the longer-term strategy.British engineering firm OpenWorks already manufactures the SkyWall 100, an anti-drone bazooka which launches a net at flying objects and parachutes them to the ground.However, James Rogers, an expert in drone warfare who is associate lecturer at the University of York, predicted \u201cnon-kinetic options\u201d would ultimately prove more effective than \u201cblunt force\u201d tactics.\u201cThere are loads of different ways to bring down a drone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s now about finding what is the most effective way to do it. If you shoot it down, well, what if it\u2019s rigged as an improvised explosive device?\u201dOn being told about the upcoming test flight event, he said: \u201cThere is a big debate out there at the moment about what the best way is to counter these small drones, whether they are used by hobbyists causing a bit of a nuisance or in a more sinister manner by a terrorist actor.\u201dThe ISIL terror group has already used basic, easy-to-buy drones to carry out reconnaissance and drop bombs in the region of Mosul, where the Iraqi government is retaking territory from the self-styled caliphate.US security services reportedly believe commercially available UAVs could in future be used by terrorists more widely to carry hazardous chemicals, radioactive material or grenades in Western cities.Rogers told E&T: \u201cWe talk about precision warfare with regards to American drone warfare. This is kind of the other side of it. These are precision missiles. You can hone in on your exact target. Proliferation of these precision technologies is what this is.\u201dForcing drone manufacturers to programme their machines so that they have pre-set areas within their positioning systems which they are barred from entering could be part of the answer to the conundrum, Rogers said, although he added: \u201cYou can always override that, so it\u2019s a hard one.\u201dIn the UK there are said to have been dozens of sightings in recent months of drones flying over sites deemed to be part of the country\u2019s critical infrastructure.It is not known if these were being flown by people harbouring harmful intent or just curious hobbyists.One well-placed source said he believed there had been thousands of such incidents recorded so far. Enthusiasts who flew drones over military sites were \u201cjust morons\u201d, he added.A British air safety watchdog yesterday revealed how an RAF Chinook helicopter at an airbase in Hampshire was nearly downed after it came within 130ft of colliding with a drone. The person controlling the drone was never tracked down.All agencies with responsibility for responding to emergencies are now factoring drones into their war games, according to Dave Sloggett, who runs exercises for the police, military and others.\u201cFor the last nine months, every single exercise I\u2019ve done for the emergency services has had a drone element in there somewhere,\u201d said Sloggett, who has also authored a book on drone warfare.Criminals have been known to use drones to carry drugs and mobile phones into prisons, over borders and even across the Straits of Gibraltar from Africa to Europe.Dutch and French police have reportedly trained several different species of eagle to catch drones in their talons.The Ministry of Defence is already pouring public money into developing so-called \u201cbiomimetic technology\u201d, producing drones based on natural forms, apparently for the purposes of intelligence gathering in urban environments.At the same time, the UK is hoping to capitalise on the economic and environmental benefits that could in future be reaped by having companies use drones to make deliveries.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target soil <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker terrorists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bring down <extra_id_0> Target drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shoot <extra_id_0> Attacker you <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target it <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack counter <extra_id_0> Target drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation carry <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact grenades <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transporter terrorists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle UAVs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination cities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack colliding <extra_id_0> Target drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument it <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation carry <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact phones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transporter Criminals <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination prisons <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "ONE day in March an American drone circled above Pakistan's North Waziristan tribal area, zeroed in on a gathering of village men, some of whom were armed, and unleashed three missiles in quick succession. It turned out to be a meeting to settle a dispute over a chromite mine. Most of the 40 or so killed were civilians, according to accounts, though a dozen Taliban also died in the attack, including a local commander, Sherabat Khan. The Taliban nowadays often adjudicate quarrels in the tribal areas, a wild buffer zone that runs along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan.The attack illustrated two problems with the drone war in the tribal regions: the risk of civilian casualties, and Pakistan's ambiguous attitude towards America's use of drones. Pakistan's army chief, Ashfaq Kayani, called the strike a \u201ccomplete violation of human rights\u201d. For Pakistan, the difficulty went beyond civilian casualties. Khan was a lieutenant of a notable warlord, Gul Bahadur. But Pakistan considers Mr Bahadur to be a \u201cgood Taliban\u201d, ie, one who has agreed to fight only in Afghanistan, not on Pakistani soil. After the strike, he threatened to tear up the deal.Relations between the governments in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, and Washington, DC, are deeply troubled by the issue of drones. Though it publicly denounces the drone strikes, Pakistan certainly does not want all of them stopped. Indeed, the co-operation of Pakistani intelligence is crucial to employing the drones. But the army wants the number of strikes reduced, concentrating on targets both countries can agree on. America has told Pakistan bluntly it must either flush the Taliban and other jihadists out of their safe havens in North Waziristan, or it will continue with what amounts to an assassination campaign there. Pakistan says it cannot launch a ground offensive in North Waziristan because its armed forces are already stretched.The drone attacks, a supposedly \u201csecret\u201d programme started by the CIA in 2004, have been ramped up over the past three years, with a record 118 strikes last year and 50 so far in 2011. The drones started under President Pervez Musharraf, the former military ruler. There were just nine strikes from 2004 to the end of 2007. According to Pakistani officials, it was supposed to be a highly selective programme for eliminating terrorist leaders in the tribal areas, under an understanding that gave the Americans the use of at least one remote Pakistani air base for the drones. The drones also take off from Afghanistan, but are operated thousands of miles away by a \u201cpilot\u201d at a desk in America, watching a video feed from the aircraft. A successful hit is known in the CIA as a \u201cbugsplat\u201d. It is all horribly like a video game.The New America Foundation, a Washington think-tank, found that up to 2,551 people have been killed in the strikes since 2004. Based on press reports, it estimates that 80% of them were militants, rising to a pretty astonishing 95% in 2010. In recent months, there has been a move away from blowing up compounds to targeting vehicles, where militants can more easily be hit without killing civilians. Even for compounds, smaller missiles are used to try to limit the damage to the separate male living quarters. Perceptions on the ground, however, are often different. The foundation's own poll in the tribal areas last year found only 16% believe the drones accurately target militants. But many locals privately support the strikes against extremists who have overrun their homeland.Accepting the figure for the success rate in killing militants nevertheless means that fully 500 or so Pakistani civilians have been killed since 2004. Unlike, say, in the war in Afghanistan, there is no investigation of civilian casualties, and no compensation paid. Transparency and accountability are absent, and some question the legal basis of the attacks. The programme is a charade because the CIA never admits to it and Pakistan pretends that it does not co-operate. A legal action launched this month, initially in Pakistan, with the backing of Reprieve, a campaigning group, seeks the arrest of a former CIA lawyer, John Rizzo, who boasted in a magazine interview this year that he used to approve a monthly list of some 30 individuals to be targeted by the drones.Whatever the outcome of that case, a debate will grind on about whether the strikes are harming al-Qaeda and related groups, or spurring on Afghanistan's powerful insurgency. According to the New America Foundation, out of the 2,600-odd deaths, 35 were recognised militant chiefs, or just 1.3% of the total. Among the successes was the fearsome leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, who was the country's number one public enemy. Still, the vast majority of targets have been low-level fighters. All the while, the number of suicide attacks in Afghanistan, many launched from Pakistan, has soared over the past year or more.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim 40 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Sherabat Khan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blowing up <extra_id_0> Target compounds <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact called <extra_id_0> Communicator Ashfaq Kayani <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

Indeed, \u00c1ngel Acebes, the country\u2019s interior minister, claimed, \u201cThere is no doubt ETA is responsible.\u201d In an outpouring of grief and defiance, the following day an estimated 11 million Spaniards, including some 2.3 million in Madrid alone, participated in demonstrations against the violence and in support of the victims.

{"text": "A report by the United Nations Human Rights Council has called for independent investigations to be carried out into drone attacks after a series of strikes that result in unexpected civilian deaths in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere. Most of the attacks involved US drones.In a 21-page report, the UN special rapporteur on human rights, Ben Emmerson, records a dramatic reduction in drone strikes in 2013 in Pakistan but increases in Afghanistan and, towards the end of the year, in Yemen.The decline in drone strikes in Pakistan comes after its government's repeated calls for the US to reduce their number. Islamabad argued that the impact of drone strikes was counterproductive, turned opinion in the country against the US and undermined the Pakistani government.But Emmerson noted a threefold increase in recorded civilian casualties from drone strikes in Afghanistan in 2013. He concluded that states have an obligation to launch inquiries into cases in which civilians become caught up.His report said: \"Having regard to the duty of states to protect civilians in armed conflict, the special rapporteur concluded that in any case in which there have been, or appear to have been, civilian casualties that were not anticipated when the attack was planned, the state responsible is under an obligation to conduct a prompt, independent and impartial fact-finding inquiry and to provide a detailed public explanation of the results.\"This obligation would be triggered whenever there is a plausible indication from any apparently reliable source that unintended civilian casualties may have been sustained.\"The proposal is likely to form the basis for a draft resolution to be debated by the UNHRC in Geneva, Switzerland.Emmerson devoted a large part of the report to listing specific drone strikes involving civilians. He said he had identified 30 attacks out of a total of 37 brought to his attention in which civilians had been killed, suffered life-threatening injuries or been put at risk.In Afghanistan, Emmerson, who travelled widely for the report, said that up to the end of 2012 drone strikes \"appeared to have inflicted significantly lower levels of civilians casualties than aerial attacks carried out by other air platforms. This is no longer the position.\"In 2013, drone attacks accounted for 40% of the total number of civilian fatalities from air strikes. There were 45 civilian fatalities and 14 non-fatal injuries, a threefold increase compared with 2012.In Pakistan, he recorded \"a marked drop\" in civilian casualties since 2012. \"Figures to the end of 2013 confirm that there has been a significant de-escalation in the number of recorded drone strikes in Pakistan,\" he said. Strikes were down to 27 in 2013 from a peak of 128 in 2010, and for the first time in nine years there had been no civilian casualties reported.\"At the time of writing, there have been no reported drone strikes during 2014, the longest pause since President Obama took office,\" Emmerson said.The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which monitors media reports on drones strikes, reported last month that there had been no known drone strikes in Pakistan since 25 December. US officials say the lull was a response to requests by the Pakistani government, which has been trying to launch peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban.In Yemen, Emmerson was told that the US routinely sought prior consent for attacks, although Human Rights Watch has quoted the Yemeni government as saying they were not pre-approved.In Israel, he said the government stressed it aimed for zero civilian casualties, saying it provided advance warning of attacks where possible. But Emmerson \"identified a number of sample strikes in which there are credible allegations that civilians were killed or injured as the result of Israeli drone strikes in Gaza\".Kat Craig, legal director of Reprieve, the legal charity which has been campaigning on the issue, said: \"In Yemen, Pakistan and elsewhere, the US, assisted by its European allies, is carrying out devastating attacks with total impunity \u2013 a practice that is terrorising local communities, and creating far more extremism than it has ever eliminated.\"It is high time that the US provided full accountability and transparency around its use of drones, and investigated civilian casualties.

Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.Yet on Sunday, critics say, an authoritarian system long in the making will be formalized, reviving memories of an era that the region had hoped was over. In defiance of international warnings, the socialist government is pushing forward with a vote to elect a constituent assembly that will have the authority to change the 1999 constitution, supplant the opposition-controlled legislature and potentially keep Maduro in power indefinitely.The opposition on Thursday called for three days of massive, nationwide protests as the government showed no willingness to back down and following the slaying of seven more demonstrators in two days. Responding to the spiraling tensions, the U.S. State Department ordered the departure of family members of American staff at its embassy in Caracas. It also authorized voluntary departures for American staff, and issued a broad travel warning for U.S. citizens.Maduro \u2014 the anointed successor of firebrand leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who died in 2013 \u2014 strongly defends the new assembly, saying it will fortify what he hails as \u201cthe communal state.\u201d While it\u2019s unclear exactly what he is seeking in a new constitution, it would likely give more power to \u201ccommunal councils\u201d in poor neighborhoods. Leaders of those councils, critics say, are government loyalists who in practice would sideline elected politicians and win direct pipelines to government funds.On the surface, the assembly vote, along with the government\u2019s pseudo-Soviet speak, hark back to old-school Marxist regimes. But many here see something perhaps more sinister emerging \u2014 a 21st-century thugocracy that rules by coercion, extortion and violence.About 100 people have died in three months of anti-government street protests. Arrests of political activists have accelerated. Bands of pro-government toughs \u2014 known as colectivos \u2014 roam poor neighborhoods, waving guns, intimidating protesters and journalists, beating opposition politicians, and warning locals to toe the government line.[How a new kind of protest movement has arisen in Venezuela]More than 7 million people voted against the establishment of the new assembly in an informal referendum July 16. Opposition parties are boycotting the election.In a country where the government is the largest employer, state workers say they are being ordered to vote Sunday, at the risk of losing their jobs. HIV patients say officials have threatened to cut off their supplies of antiretroviral drugs if they do not turn out for the election. Families risk being scratched off government food distribution rosters for not showing up \u2014 a dire outcome in a country where a socialist experiment and economic mismanagement have sparked hyperinflation and food shortages.Such threats are not idle, either. Yanelis Banco, 36 years old and nearly nine months pregnant, said her boss at the government postal service called her in along with other department heads for a talk last week. He ordered them, she said, to sign a form pledging to vote Sunday.She and five other senior staffers refused. All of them lost their jobs, she said.\u201cI\u2019m a pregnant woman who has been working in the company for 10 years and four months, so I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d fire me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do I have to sign if I don\u2019t agree? I thought the law protected me!\u201dShe added: \u201cAll the other employees are terrified. Now they\u2019re sure that if they don\u2019t vote, they\u2019ll be fired. None of them can afford that.\u201d[Stuck in a death spiral, Venezuela is borrowing money at any cost]Maduro has acknowledged that the government is pressuring public employees to vote. At a rally with public energy workers this month, he said: \u201cTake the lists of workers from all the state institutions and businesses to create a constituent committee. For each business, call all the workers and organize how they\u2019ll vote on July 30th. At the end of the day, check the list. If there are 15,000 workers, there have to be 15,000 votes, with no excuses.\u201dVenezuela\u2019s political protests have been fueled by the disastrous state of the economy, growing authoritarian rule and the government\u2019s resistance to early elections. The country\u2019s electoral council ruled against the opposition when it sought a referendum in 2016 that could have cut short Maduro\u2019s six-year term. The council also pushed back elections for governors, scheduled for 2016, to December of this year. Critics fear that the new assembly will cancel those, as well as the presidential election in 2018.The U.S. Treasury Department in February froze Vice President Tareck El Aissami\u2019s American assets over his alleged involvement in narcotics trafficking and took similar action against eight justices of the pro-government supreme court after it tried to strip power from the opposition-led legislature. On Wednesday, the Trump administration targeted 13 more Venezuelan officials, alleging violations of human rights and corruption.[Trump administration hits 13 Venezuelans with sanctions in advance of vote]Once the richest country per capita in South America due to its vast oil reserves, Venezuela was also cursed with vast disparities that kept an elite in luxury while the poor languished in slums. The result was Ch\u00e1vez, who used the petroleum wealth to launch massive social programs, even as he concentrated power. He remains much beloved by millions of Venezuelans, although many others \u2014 especially in the middle and upper classes \u2014 loathe him.Maduro\u2019s approval rating, on the other hand, is hovering around 20 percent, with opponents calling this weekend\u2019s vote the only way for him to remain in the presidential palace.He has promised Venezuelans that the assembly will herald a new era of security and stability.\u201cJuly 30th will be the birth of a historic trigger of the homeland for a new phase of peace and advancement,\u201d Maduro told a campaign rally this week.Yet many Venezuelans fear just the opposite \u2014 a deepening of official repression. It is already starting, they say.Take, for instance, 51-year-old Lisbeth A\u00f1ez, or \u201cMama Lis.\u201d For years, she was known for aiding anti-government protesters, bringing them blankets and cooking them fresh arepas, or cornmeal cakes.In May, she was arrested and charged with treason.Her case is in the hands of a military tribunal. In recent months, scores of civilians who have taken part in demonstrations or other perceived anti-government acts have been sent into the military court system, where they can face lengthy prison sentences.\u201cI can\u2019t sleep, I can\u2019t eat, even if we had enough food,\u201d said her son, Luis Gonz\u00e1lez A\u00f1ez, 23, who said he was refused entry to her trial. \u201cI have nightmares, thinking about her in jail . . . I didn\u2019t think things could get worse, but they have.\u201dGabriela Ram\u00edrez, Venezuela\u2019s former public ombudsman and a longtime Ch\u00e1vez supporter, said she feared the government would become worse than a dictatorship. \u201cWe will have a narco-authoritarian regime,\u201d she said.Ram\u00edrez, who carries around a pocket version of Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s 1999 constitution in her purse, is among the ranks of former \u201cChavistas\u201d \u2014 or Ch\u00e1vez backers \u2014 who have turned against Maduro. She has paid for it with harassment, she said, including a recent hack in which intimate photos of her and her husband were leaked on social media.\u201cThere will no longer be any check on their power,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will control everything.\u201dFollowing an opposition-called 48-hour strike, the government on Thursday issued a ban on public gatherings and protests lasting from Friday through Tuesday. The opposition responded by calling for nationwide mobilization, asking citizens to take to the streets from the Caribbean Sea to the Andes Mountains.In an interview, Freddy Guevara, an opposition leader and vice president of the National Assembly, played down the chances of any deal to suspend or cancel the vote. Former Spanish prime minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero is in Caracas, and has served as an intermediary between the government and opposition. Guevara denied reports that a deal had been offered to suspend the vote.\u201cIt is wishful thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cI am sure they are going forward with this scam, and that we are going to respond with pressure.\u201dBut even leading members of the opposition appear to be losing hope that Maduro will back down.Scenarios for what happens next range widely. Some observers suggest that social unrest and international sanctions will worsen, prompting, perhaps, a military coup or fueling an anti-government guerrilla movement. Others say the government, likely with the aid of Russia and China, will somehow manage to hold on as the country becomes an international pariah.Still others see a worst-case scenario of social implosion and anarchy.\u201cSomalia,\u201d said Henrique Capriles, an opposition leader and governor of the state of Miranda.\u201cWe could become a failed state.\u201dMariana Zu\u00f1iga contributed to this report.Read moreThings are so bad in Venezuela that people are rationing toothpasteVenezuela\u2019s paradox: people are hungry, but farmers can\u2019t feed themMaduro wants to rewrite the constitution.

{"text": "A statement after a two-hour emergency meeting at Stormont Castle, said that Mr Whitelaw, the defence secretary, Lord Carrington, and army and civilian advisers, had considered the Provisional IRA's \"bombing outrages\".\"They deplored the slaughter and maiming of men, women and children, which took place today on Provisional IRA orders, clearly acting with the utmost ferocity. In the light of these murderous attacks, the ministers authorised certain operations against the terrorists to be undertaken forthwith.\"Early today Mr Whitelaw gave an interview to the BBC about forthcoming security measures. He said: \"I am going to make an immediate and clear response to the ghastly attacks on innocent people that have taken place in the last 24 hours.\"This will be a clearly determined operation that will do everything possible to root out those responsible for these appalling crimes.\" He added that the measures would become apparent \"very soon\".On the question of the possible reintroduction of internment, he said: \"The internment of suspects is never ruled out, but I don't contemplate it with any pleasure.\"Shootings in Belfast had continued last night. In one incident, a man was killed and five more were wounded, in a battle between troops and terrorists in the Markets area. The army claimed to have hit three gunmen.Later, a man was shot dead when he answered a knock at his door in Deerpark Road, in the Old Park district of the city.Just after 11.30pm a wave of shooting broke out in the main Catholic areas. The army said that the initial shooting incidents did not involve the security forces, but that after midnight their posts in Anderstown and the Old Park Road came under intense gunfire. There were no military casualties.In the afternoon, during an hour of concentrated bombing at least 11 people died. They included two soldiers, a little girl and a messenger boy. Ninety six people were detained in hospital, and about 24 others were allowed home after treatment.The Provisional IRA accepted responsibility for the bombings, which seemed to be aimed at civilians. It claimed that at least 30 minutes' warning was given before each explosion, but the warnings which were received were so vague as to be almost useless.A spokesman for the Belfast Brigade of the Provisional IRA pointed out that telephoned warnings were given to the Samaritans, the police, newspapers and the local Rumour Service and Public Protection Service at least thirty minutes before each explosion. In the case of the two worst explosions at Oxford Street and the Cavehill Road, warnings were given well in advance. The Oxford Street warning was heard over the military radio net at 2.10pm, and a woman telephoned the police telling of a box in the back of a car on the Cavehill Road an hour before the explosion.Huge explosive decides were detonated at places certain to be thronged with people - bus termini, railway stations, and shopping centres. It was calculated that over 1,000lb of explosives had been used.At 2.45pm, when the bombing began, and for much of the afternoon, Belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic.Girls and men wept openly, hugging each other for safety in the main streets, as plumes of smoke rose around them, and dull thuds echoed from wall to wall.It was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe. As each bomb exploded there were cries of terror from people who thought they had found sanctuary, but in fact were just as exposed as before.Thousands streamed out of the stricken city immediately after the attacks, and huge traffic jams built up. All bus services were cancelled, and on some roads hitch hikers frantically trying to get away lined the pavements.By the time it was all over, some 21 bombs had gone off in Belfast and there were fears of more to come. Sources close to the Provisionals indicated that more were planned for last night and for the weekend.Mr Whitelaw and Lord Carrington immediately flew back to Belfast in an RAF transport plane for their emergency meeting. The army GOC, Sir Harry Tuzo, the acting chief of the RUC, Mr David Corbett, and one of Mr Whitelaw's juniors, Mr David Howell, also attended.From at least two Ulster Protestant politicians, there were urgent demands last night for an immediate resumption of the internment policy. One of them, Mr William Craig, leader of Ulster Vanguard, and a former Stormont Cabinet Minister, called for its \"immediate massive resumption\".While this course was not thought one of those Mr Whitelaw was more likely to pursue, it was felt that stringent security measures must now be enforced.The possibility that a major cordon-and-search operation may now be undertaken in one of the prime Republican areas - possibly even in the Andersonstown estate where the Belfast IRA leaders meet and plan their main operations - is becoming very real indeed.If Mr Whitelaw does not act swiftly, there is little doubt here that understandably militant Protestants, headed by the huge and formidably well disciplined Ulster Defence Association, may decide to take the law into their own hands.Last night the UDA leaders were meeting in emergency session in a house in the city and refused to comment on their plans. They did stress, however, that no action was contemplated for some hours. But only four hours after the bombing, UDA car and foot patrols were seen on the streets in East Belfast. Presumably they were there in a defensive role for a very frightened and intimidated Protestant population.The bombs began to explode before 3pm. Then for roughly 20 minutes they exploded roughly at one a minute. Smoke appeared in all directions above the roofs of shops and offices. As the attacks continued, and the whole city centre echoed to the crack of the bombs, a few people began to panic. Weeping children had to be comforted by their mothers, and passers-by had to strike hysterical girls to bring them under control.The worst explosion was at the busy Oxford Street bus station, where at least six people were killed. Reports by witnesses said that the bomb had been planted in a car.

{"text": "The 2019 Quetta bombing was a suicide bomb attack on an open marketplace in Quetta, Pakistan on 12 April, killing 21 people.The bombing took place near an area where many minority Shiite Muslims live.At least ten Hazara, including nine Shiites, were among the dead.Two paramilitary soldiers were also killed in the bombing.PM Imran Khan expressed condolences for the lives lost, directed the authorities to ensure the best medical treatment for the injured, and ordered an increase in security for Shiites and Hazara people.Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and ISIL later accepted responsibility for the attack, stating that \"their target were Hazara people.\"== Background ==Hazaras have been frequently targeted by Taliban and Islamic State militants and other Sunni Muslim militant groups in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.They have been heavily targeted in Afghanistan in attacks claimed by an affiliate of the Islamic State.509 Hazara people has been killed in terror related incidents in the

predominantly Shia.== Blast ==A suicide attack was carried out in the late afternoon of 12 April 2019 by the Sunni militant at a potato stall in a crowded Hazarganji vegetable market.One survivor reported the blast being so powerful that the air was filled with black smoke and people were unable to hear each other.20 people including one paramilitary soldier were killed, as well as the perpetrator.On 16 April, one more paramilitary soldier died of his injuries.== Responsibility ==Initially, no group claimed responsibility for the blast.After some hours, the leader of Sunni militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for the attack and issued a warning that more attacks were planned.A spokesperson of the group, Qari Saifullah, told CNN \"We claim responsibility for the attack in Quetta, we targeted the Hazara community.\"The same group had previously carried out attacks against Hazara minorities.ISIL also claimed the responsibility of this attack, releasing a photograph of the bomber along with his name.Various Sunni militant groups in Pakistan, including  Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, have been backed by ISIL for several years.== Reaction ==Pakistan's ruling Government PTI condemned the attack and wrote on Twitter: \"We strongly condemn the terrorist attack in #Quetta that resulted in the loss of innocent lives.Prayers for the injured and for the precious

{"text": "The 1995 Rijeka bombing occurred on 20 October 1995 in Rijeka, Croatia, when an Islamic terrorist organization attempted to destroy a police station by driving a car with a bomb into the wall of the building.Twenty-seven employees in the police station and two bystanders on the street were injured, although the only person killed was the attacker.== Cause ==In the last days of the Bosnian War, the Croatian Defense Council (HVO), a Bosnian Croat military force, captured Talaat Fouad Qasim when he attempted to enter Bosnia and Herzegovina.Qasim, an important member of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, was soon transferred to Egypt with the active help of Croatia.Because of that and because Croatia had de facto controlled the Croatian Defence Council, the military organization which had captured Talaat Fouad Qasim, a decision was made to commit a terrorist attack in Croatia.== The attack ==At 11:21\u00a0a.m. Central European Time, a Fiat 131 Mirafiori entered the parking lot of the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County police headquarters.Due to the 90-degree turn needed to enter the lot, the vehicle moved slowly.Near the entrance, the driver did not park in the parking spaces for civilians, but instead started to accelerate towards the wall at the end of the parking lot.Due to the low security measures, this incident was not noticed before the attack itself took place.After 15\u201320 meters, passing 8-10 available parking spaces in the small lot, the Fiat crashed into the stairs leading to the police station and exploded.The time of explosion was recorded as 11:22\u00a0a.m. local time (10:22\u00a0UTC).Subsequently, a police investigation found out the car was loaded with  of highly-explosive TNT.The police also found a part of a Canadian passport inside the remains of the attacker's car.The next day, representatives of the al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya terrorist organization from Egypt claimed responsibility for the attack, requesting extradition of Qasim.Due to an error made by the attackers, the bombing did not cause fatalities, aside from the suicide bomber himself.The police headquarters is located on a higher ground than the parking lot itself, requiring the stairs in the first place.The other apparent miscalculation involved the size of the parking lot, where the Fiat 131 had neither the space and velocity, nor the horsepower, to climb the stairs and destroy the police station wall.As a result, the police station failed to collapse and only 29 injuries were recorded (including two unaware bystanders).The bomb also carved a large crater in the ground, battering nearby buildings and destroying vehicles.== Aftermath ==With the help of the CIA, officials examined the video footage of the attack.American and Croatian investigative sources came to the conclusion that Hassan al-Sharif Mahmud Saad had organized this attack.Saad had come to live in Bosnia only that year; previously, he had been living in Italy.Soon after the attack, Bosnian officials discovered that Saad was planning a new terrorist attack, against NATO forces, which was to happen in December 1995.A few days after that attack failed, he was killed in central Bosnia in a firefight with Croatian Defense Council forces.== See also ==*1993 Hidroelektra Workers Massacre== References ==== Other sources ==*Novi List (newspaper of Rijeka)", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim bystanders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Killer person <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain captured <extra_id_0> Detainee Talaat Fouad Qasim <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Victim bystanders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle battering <extra_id_0> Artifact buildings <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle destroying <extra_id_0> Artifact vehicles <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker Hassan al-Sharif Mahmud Saad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack firefight  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "US Charges Kyrgyzstan National with Hampering Boston Bombing ProbeBOSTON \u2014\u00a0U.S. officials on Friday charged a Kyrgyzstan national who bought dinner for the accused Boston Marathon bombers the night of the attack with interfering with the investigation into the deadly bombing.Khairullozhon Matanov, a 23-year-old taxi driver who lives in Quincy, Massachusetts, faces one criminal count of destroying records and three counts of lying to officials in a terrorism investigation, according to court papers filed in U.S. District Court in Boston.Brothers Tamerlan Tsarnaev, left, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are accused of carrying out the Boston Marathon bombing. Tamerlan was closely monitored while in Dagestan last year.Prosecutors said Matanov had been friends with accused bombers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, spoke with both in the days after the blast but lied to police about the extent of his relationship with the pair.Matanov, who had hiked a New Hampshire mountain with Tamerlan Tsarnaev to \u201ctrain like, and praise, the 'mujahideen,\u201d' according to court papers, deleted searches related to the attacks from his computer, tried to dispose of cell phones he had used to contact the brothers, and denied knowing much about the pair in interviews with police.Matanov was not accused of playing a role in the April 15, 2013, bombing, which killed three people and injured 264. The Tsarnaev brothers have also been accused of shooting dead a police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology three days after the attack as they tried to flee Boston.Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died after a shootout with police following that incident, while Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was apprehended early the next evening. The surviving brother, now 20, is awaiting trial and faces the possibility of execution if convicted.Matanov told an unidentified witness cooperating with the government that \u201cthe bombings could have had a just reason, such as being done in the name of Islam, that he would support the bombings if the reason were just or the attack had been done by the Taliban, and that the victims had gone to paradise,\u201d according to the papers.Matanov was arrested early Friday by members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force at his home in Quincy. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of destroying evidence and eight years for each false statement count.He is the fourth person to face criminal charges for interfering with the investigation into the largest mass-casualty attack on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.The others are three college friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev: Kazakhstan exchange students Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, as well as Robel Phillipos of Cambridge. Prosecutors contended that after the FBI released photos of the suspected bombers, the three men realized the suspects' identities and removed a laptop and backpack containing empty fireworks shells from Dzhokhar's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant national <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Defendant Tamerlan Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 264 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Defendant brothers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer brothers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Matanov <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges <extra_id_0> Defendant He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The owner of a body shop and truck rental agency in Junction City, Kan., identified Timothy McVeigh in court Friday as the man who rented the Ryder truck used in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building.\"I was looking right at him,\" declared Eldon Elliott, owner of Elliott's Body Shop, recalling the two occasions when McVeigh, now 29, entered his shop--on April 15, 1995, to reserve a truck and pay the $280.32 rental fee in advance; and on April 17 to pick up the 20-foot Ryder truck. He said McVeigh used the name \"Robert Kling.\"\"That's the way I look at everybody,\" he told jurors and U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch. \"I look at them right square in the face.\"\"Is there any doubt in your mind?\" asked Justice Department prosecutor Scott Mendeloff.\"No,\" Elliott replied.\"Who was it?\" Mendeloff asked.\"Timothy McVeigh,\" Elliott said.Asked to point him out, Elliott gestured to the defense table. \"Right over there. Blue shirt.\"McVeigh sat stone-faced, wearing a blue oxford shirt with long sleeves rolled up. He did not acknowledge Elliott's identification.The testimony came on a day when prosecutors presented a series of witnesses and documents, including telephone records, a taxi log and a Chinese food takeout order, as well as surveillance photos from a McDonald's restaurant, to trace McVeigh's movements from April 14, 1995, when prosecutors say he arrived in Junction City, until April 17, when the Ryder truck was driven from Elliott's shop around 4:30 p.m.The Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was shattered by an explosion at 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and injuring more than 500 others.McVeigh is on trial on charges of murder and conspiracy.Prosecutors claim McVeigh arrived in Junction City on April 14, where he sold his car and purchased a yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis. He allegedly walked to the J and K bus depot where he called Elliott's to obtain a price quote on a Ryder truck rental.According to testimony, McVeigh checked into the Dreamland Motel later that day and stayed until the 17th.Prosecutors say he drove the truck to Geary Lake in Kansas, that 4,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate laced with nitromethane were loaded into the truck there, and that it was driven to Oklahoma City and detonated.Elliott testified that on April 15, McVeigh came to the body shop and reserved the truck, to be picked up at 4 p.m. two days later.Elliott said that McVeigh gave him the $280.32 in exact change after declining to pay an additional amount for insurance. He rented the truck using a driver's license in the name of \"Robert Kling\" that showed an address in Redfield, S.D., Elliott said.To piece together McVeigh's movements, prosecutors called Yuhua Bai, owner of Hunam Palace, in Junction City, who testified that shortly after 5 p.m. on April 15 she took a phone order for moo goo gai pan and egg rolls from a caller who gave the name \"Kling\" and requested delivery to Room 25 at the Dreamland. According to previous testimony, McVeigh was assigned Room 25.Phone records indicated were shown to the jury indicating that a call was made from that room to the Hunam Palace at 5:17 p.m. on the 15th.Prosecutors also called David D'Albini, manager of the McDonald's at the time, who narrated surveillance photographs taken in the restaurant April 17.Watching a TV monitor, jurors saw McVeigh, clad in a plaid shirt and jeans, approach the counter and later walk out of the restaurant.The video, which carried a date and time stamp, showed him leaving the restaurant at 3:57 p.m.", "event":

{"text": "Prosecutors Push Death Sentence for Boston Bomber TsarnaevNearly two weeks after convicting accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev of all 30 charges against him, jurors Tuesday heard reasons he should be put to death.U.S. prosecutors showed the 12-member jury a photo of Tsarnaev giving the middle finger to a surveillance camera the day of his first court appearance in 2013.\"This is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini. \"Unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged.\"The 21-year-old, an ethnic Chechen U.S. immigrant-turned-citizen, was found guilty of working with his older brother, Tamerlan, to carry out the April 15, 2013 attack. The twin pressure cooker bombs they set off killed three people and wounded 264. The two brothers also fatally shot a police officer as they tried to elude a massive police manhunt. The elder Tsarnaev was killed days after the bombings during their attempted escape.The court Tuesday was shown large photos of the four dead victims.\"They were all beautiful, and they're all now gone,\" said Pellegrini. She described the killings as \"unbearable, indescribable, inexcusable and senseless,\" labeling the younger Tsarnaev \"America's worst nightmare.\"Witnesses who lost limbs or loved ones in the bombings also were called to the stand, recounting the horror of the attack.Jurors must now determine whether Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death or life in prison. The penalty phase of the trial could last a month. If the jury does not agree unanimously on a death sentence, a life without parole sentence will be imposed automatically.Tsarnaev's attorneys, pushing for life behind bars, have argued that his radicalized older brother was the driving force behind the attack, and that Dzhokhar played a secondary role out of a sense of sibling loyalty.Some survivors and the parents of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who died in the attack, also have lobbied publicly against a death sentence.\"We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty,\" Bill and Denise Richard wrote in an essay in The Boston Globe last week, \"but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong the most painful day of our lives.\"Over the past 15 years, only three people have been put to death by the federal government - Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, drug smuggler Juan Raul Garza and kidnapper Louis Jones. Tsarnaev's lawyers acknowledged from the start of the federal trial that he was involved in the plot to detonate the bombs. But defense attorney Judy Clarke, who has successfully kept other notorious U.S. murder convicts off death row, told the jury at the end of the first phase of the trial, \"If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened.\"The elder Tsarnaev died after being shot by police and inadvertently driven over by Dzhokhar as the two brothers attempted to flee the Boston area.Dzhokhar was later found hiding in a boat parked in the backyard of a suburban Boston home. Prosecutors say he scrawled a motive for the attack on the inside wall of the boat, writing that the brothers were trying to avenge American attacks on Muslims in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Sentence Sentence <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt Prosecutors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant Bomber Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicting <extra_id_0> Defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact heard <extra_id_0> Participant jurors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Topic Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Participant U.S <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact showed <extra_id_0> Participant jury <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker 21-year-old <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim 264 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die shot <extra_id_0> Victim officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer brothers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation elude  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation escape  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact described <extra_id_0> Participant She <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Martin Richard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die death <extra_id_0> Victim Louis Jones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shot <extra_id_0> Attacker police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack driven over <extra_id_0> Attacker Dzhokhar <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flee <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact brothers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin area <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact wrote <extra_id_0> Participant Denise Richard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic death penalty <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Pellegrini <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "President Nicolas Maduro remembered the fateful day and said that \"like a phoenix,\" the Venezuelan people resurfaced to proudly stand today.As Venezuelans commemorate the 82nd anniversary of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, Aug. 4 also marks a critical day in the country\u2019s recent history. One year ago, in a speech during the 81st anniversary, President Nicolas Maduro was the target of a failed assassination attempt.\"They not only came for me, but they also came for everyone, for the people, and for our country, wanting to undermine the peace and sovereignty of the nation,\" the president said Sunday remembering the frustrated attempt in a speech from the Military Academy in Caracas.\"But God intervened and like the phoenix, we resurfaced from the ashes of a terrorist attack and today a year later I can say that we are standing,\" he added, affirming, once again, the masterminds were the Colombian and United States government.On Aug. 4, 2018, an explosive-loaded drone detonated before reaching a stage where President Maduro was delivering a speech during a military parade in the capital. At that time, the Venezuelan right-wing opposition and its allies, one of which was the U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton, said the explosion was \"a montage.\"\u201cAfter the brief moment of confusion, we knew it was an attack. There were many speculations and lies afterward in the networks but we insisted that it had been an assassination attempt,\u201d Mariela Lopez, a freelance videographer for HispanTV and Xinhua, remembered; as her images, taken in the precise moment of the explosion and the security team's response, were shown around the world.Despite the evidence, global mainstream media ridiculed the drone attack using qualifiers such as \"presumed\", \"supposed\", \"confusing event\" and \"alleged drones\". On Aug. 5, 2018, for instance, CNN Spanish titled an article \"the world reacts to the alleged attack against Nicolas Maduro.\"New videos obtained by CNN provide insight into last year's drone attack against #Venezuela's sitting president Nicolas #Maduro.It may be the world's first known attempt to kill a head of state with a retail drone.@npwcnn reports:https://t.co/A0qJ1Vd3cf \u2014 Michael Rios (@MikeRiosNews) March 14, 2019However, as time went on truth surfaced and on March 2019, CNN revealed unpublished images of how such attack was prepared on a Colombian farm, information which was provided by one of whom were involved in the attempted attack.The report agreed with the government's assertions about the attack.CNN then published an interview with a Venezuelan dissident who organized the attack. He admitted that the objective was to assassinate Maduro, an outcome which involved expecting some \"collateral damages.\"\"[Killing other people] was the risk we had to take,\" the attack organizer said in response to questions and explained that the drones were purchased online and imported to a Colombian farm, where plotters were training day and night in the handling of the devices.The Venezuelan conspirator also assured that U.S. government officials had three meetings with the plotters after the assassination attempt occurred. In those meetings, according to CNN, these officials only \"took notes\" on the background of the plan and its failure.On June 11, Venezuela\u2019s Attorney General, Tarek William Saab, informed that 38 suspects have been indicted in the case of the frustrated assassination attempt and as investigations continue, of the 38 linked so far, 31 are deprived of liberty and seven received substitutive measures.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime assassination <extra_id_0> Victim Nicolas Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime assassination  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime assassinate <extra_id_0> Victim Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Perpetrator He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact delivering <extra_id_0> Communicator Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize knew <extra_id_0> Identifier we <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict indicted <extra_id_0> Defendant suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact speech <extra_id_0> Communicator Nicolas Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact speech <extra_id_0> Communicator the president <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize ridiculed  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize admitted <extra_id_0> Identifier He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "CBS News Report: Bombing Suspect Wrote Message in BoatAccused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was found hiding in a boat days after the blasts, left a handwritten message describing the attack as retribution for U.S. wars in Muslim countries, CBS News reported on Thursday.The CBS News report, citing anonymous sources, said that Tsarnaev used a pen to write the message on an interior wall of the boat, where police found him bleeding from gunshot wounds four days after the April 15 bombing.The note summed up with the idea that \u201cwhen you attack one Muslim, you attack all Muslims,\u201d CBS News reported.CBS News did not make clear how its sources knew the information and Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the report.A spokeswoman for the FBI in Boston, Katherine Gulotta, declined to confirm or deny the report.The CBS News report said Tsarnaev, 19, described his older brother and fellow suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, who died in a gunbattle with police, as \u201ca martyr.\u201d\u201cBasically, the note says... the bombings were retribution for the U.S. crimes against Muslims in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and that the victims of the Boston bombing were 'collateral damage,' the same way innocent victims have been collateral damage in U.S. wars around the world,\u201d said CBS News reporter John Miller, who is a former spokesman for the FBI.The bombings at the finish line of the world-famous marathon killed three people and injured 264 others. The FBI identified the ethnic Chechen brothers as suspects from video and pictures at the scene.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested in Watertown, Massachusetts, on April 19 after a daylong manhunt and lockdown of much of the Boston area. He is being held in a prison hospital west of Boston and faces charges that could carry the death penalty if he is convicted.Tamerlan Tsarnaev had been on a U.S. government database of potential terrorism suspects and the United States had twice been warned by Russia that he might be an Islamic militant, according to U.S. security officials.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure bleeding <extra_id_0> Victim Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injurer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Target people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges <extra_id_0> Defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Friend of Boston Marathon Bomber Faces Up to 7 YearsBOSTON \u2014\u00a0A college friend of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev might have prevented a university police officer's shooting death by helping authorities find Tsarnaev instead of helping him, the officer's family said in a court filing Wednesday.Massachusetts Institute of Technology Officer Sean Collier was killed in an encounter with Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, in Cambridge hours after authorities publicly released photographs and videos of them as suspects in the April 2013 bombing, which killed three people and injured more than 260.Tamerlan later died after a shootout with police in Watertown, and Dzhokhar was found hiding in a covered boat docked in a backyard there.Federal prosecutors filed the statement by Collier's stepfather, Joseph Rogers, along with a recommendation for a seven-year sentence for Tsarnaev's friend Dias Kadyrbayev. That sentence is the maximum agreed to when Kadyrbayev pleaded guilty last year to impeding the bombing investigation.Kadyrbayev is being sentenced June 2. A message seeking comment from his attorney wasn't immediately returned Wednesday.Prosecutors said there's no evidence Kadyrbayev knew about the plot to detonate two pressure cooker bombs loaded with shrapnel near the marathon's finish line. They said he recognized Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's photo when authorities released it and he removed Tsarnaev's laptop and backpack from his dorm room at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.\"Had the defendant done the right thing, and called the police,\" Rogers said, \"the Tsarnaev brothers' murderous rampage across Cambridge and Watertown may have been prevented.\"Tsarnaev's lawyers acknowledged his role in the deadly bombings, and he was convicted of many criminal charges. A jury last month sentenced him to death.Two more of his friends -- Azamat Tazhayakov and Robel Phillipos -- have been convicted of impeding the investigation.

{"text": "The Cafeter\u00eda Rolando bombing was an attack on 13 September 1974 at the Rolando cafe in Calle del Correo, Madrid, Spain which killed 13 people and wounded 71. Though no claim of responsibility was made, the attack is widely believed to have been carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA.==Background==The Rolando Cafe was located on 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid, close to the General Directorate of Security, the headquarters of the Spanish Police. It was regularly frequented by members of the police force and security services.==The attack==The bomb was placed at the entrance to the building and exploded on a Friday afternoon, during a busy lunchtime period. More than 300 people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the explosion, two of whom were among the dead. The explosion caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security, while two cars parked nearby were totally destroyed. The bomb caused part of the Rolando Cafe's ceiling to collapse and guests staying in a pension above were injured due to falling through the gaps in the ceiling. The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene.Two of the 12 initially killed and 11 of the injured were members of the police force. However the wounded included the number two of the Spanish Political Police, with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe. A thirteenth victim died in 1977 of injuries suffered during the attack.==Responses and arrests==The leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September, issued a statement denying their responsibility, though implicitly defending the bombing, claiming that the cafe was full of police agents. This caused tensions within the group, with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out, even if the results were not those intended. The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country, such as Blas Pi\u00f1ar, the opportunity to attack the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro.In the immediate period of confusion following the attack, some blamed the attack on the far-right. The police, however, concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group's infrastructure in Madrid. Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) of cooperating in the attack, but the PCE energetically denied involvement. Reports that police officers had received a circular advising them not to go to the Rolando Cafe or stand outside the building added to the mystery surrounding the incident.Leftists known to be sympathetic to ETA were arrested, including Eva Forest, wife of the communist playwright Alfonso Sastre, Mari Luz Fernandez and her relatives, Lidia Falc\u00f3n, the theatre director Vicente Sainz de la Pe\u00f1a, construction worker Antonio Dur\u00e1n, pilot Bernardo Badell and his wife Mar\u00eda del Carmen Nadal, the actress Mar\u00eda Paz Ballesteros, and the writer Eliseo Bayo. Between June 1975 and February 1976, courts dismissed the cases and released the defendants. However Eva Forest and Mari Luz Fernandez remained in prison as they were charged with complicity in the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco one year before. However, neither Forest nor Luz Fernandez were tried for the Rolando bombing, as they were released in June 1977 as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners. In 1981 Lidia Falc\u00f3n published a denunciation of Eva Forest which suggested that Forest's role in the Rolando attack had been considerable.The government also offered a reward of one million pesetas for information leading to the capture of Juan Manuel Galarraga Mendizabal who they suspected of being a high ranking ETA figure involved in the bombing. Exact authorship of the bombing has however remained a mystery.==References==", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place Cafeter\u00eda Rolando <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Rolando cafe <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim 71 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> Target building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place El Tobogan restaurant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim whom <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle damage <extra_id_0> Artifact buildings <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle shattering <extra_id_0> Artifact windows <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle destroyed <extra_id_0> Artifact cars <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle collapse <extra_id_0> Artifact ceiling <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim guests <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim 12 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 11 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim customers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim victim <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker organisation <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Eliseo Bayo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target Carlos Arias Navarro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassination <extra_id_0> Target Luis Carrero Blanco <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ReleaseParole released <extra_id_0> Defendant they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack carried out <extra_id_0> Attacker ETA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble placed <extra_id_0> Artifact bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact issued <extra_id_0> Topic statement <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator leadership <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Belgium Police Release New Video of Brussels Bombing SuspectPARIS \u2014\u00a0Belgian police have released new video of a wanted Brussels airport bombing suspect even as the lawyer for a Paris attacks suspect says his extradition may take a few more weeks.Released Thursday in French and Flemish, the police video shows the minutes following the March 22 Zaventem Airport bombings and the apparent getaway of the third surviving suspect -- often identified in the media as \"the man with the hat.\" Local media previously released security camera video of the man at Zaventem Airport shortly before the bombings, wearing a hat and a light jacket and walking alongside suicide bombers Ibrahim el-Bakraoui and Najim Laachraoui. All three men are seen pushing carts with bags on them.With running commentary in French and Flemish, the police footage shows the third man leaving the airport after the bombs went off at 7:58 a.m. First he is walking, then he breaks into a jog. His face is not seen clearly in the new images.Watch video released by FedPol Belgium:We are sorry, but this feature is currently not availableAccording to Belgian authorities, the man walked more then 10 kilometers in the ensuring hours, crossing the town of Zaventem with video finally showing him in the Schaerbeek area of Brussels, before disappearing at a crossroads at 09:50 local time. Police say he got rid of his jacket along the way, and subsequent footage shows him in shirtsleeves. He is described as wearing a light blue shirt, dark pants and brown shoes with wide white soles.Asking for citizens' help Belgian police have released local and international phone numbers for people to call if they have any information on the man or a jacket that looks like the one in the video.The Brussels airport attacks, along with a suicide bombing at the Maelbeek metro station in the Belgian capital about an hour later, killed 32 people and wounded more than 340.This photo provided on Wednesday, March 23, 2016 by Interpol shows Belgium's Khalid Bakraoui. Belgian state broadcaster RTBF has identified two of the attackers who targeted Brussels as brothers Khalid and Brahim Bakraoui.Ibrahim el-Bakraoui\u2019s brother, Khalid, was named as the suicide bomber in the metro attack. Both brothers had criminal records. Turkish authorities had earlier caught Ibrahim el-Bakraoui trying to cross into Syria and deported him.Authorities have found a tangle of links between the Brussels attacks suspects and those involved in the November attacks in Paris \u2014 including surviving Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam, who is believed to have been in charge of logistics. The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for both attacks.Born in France but brought up in Belgium, Abdeslam was arrested days before the Brussels attacks and is currently in a high-security Belgian prison awaiting extradition to France. That move had been expected to be imminent, but his Belgian lawyer, Sven Mary, told journalists Thursday that Abdeslam\u2019s extradition would not happen for several weeks.Lawyer Mary also said Abdeslam was not formally implicated to date in the Brussels attacks.A Belgian police officer secures the area around the European Council headquarters following recent bomb attacks in the Brussels metro and at Belgian international airport of Zaventem, in Brussels, Belgium, March 30, 2016.Criticism of intelligence lapses Belgian authorities have been sharply criticized for intelligence lapses leading up to the attacks.The country\u2019s justice and interior ministers both tendered their resignations, which Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel refused to accept.Last month, Belgian authorities said they had arrested the suspected \"man with the hat,\" who the prosecutors\u2019 office identified as Faycal C., before releasing him days later, apparently for lack of sufficient evidence.Media identified him early on as Faycal Cheffou, a self-styled freelance journalist. In interviews after his release, Cheffou said the arrest had \u201cruined\u201d his life.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack Bombing <extra_id_0> Place Brussels <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ReleaseParole release <extra_id_0> Defendant his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Jailer they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ReleaseParole releasing <extra_id_0> Defendant him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack targeted <extra_id_0> Target Brussels <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Brahim Bakraoui <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack went off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim 340 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Maelbeek metro station <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Place Belgian international airport <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Place Zaventem Airport <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Abdeslam <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation leaving <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin airport <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant Sven Mary <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Place Zaventem Airport <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Place Brussels <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Brussels airport <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Place Paris <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place metro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Khalid <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Place Paris <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Place Brussels <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker group <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation deported <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transporter authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Mary <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Abdeslam <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Charting the data for US airstrikes in Pakistan, 2004 - 2015 Created by Bill RoggioSince 2004, the US has been conducting a covert program to target and kill al Qaeda and Taliban commanders based in Pakistan's lawless northwest. The program has targeted top al Qaeda leaders, al Qaeda's external operations network, and Taliban leaders and fighters who threaten both the Afghan and Pakistani states.The charts below look at the following: 1) the number of US airstrikes inside Pakistan per year; 2) civilian casualties vs. Taliban/al Qaeda casualties; 3) the distribution of strikes over time by tribal agencies; 4) the overall distribution of strikes, by tribal agencies; 5) the distribution of strikes over time by territories targeted; 6) the overall distribution of strikes, by territories targeted; and 7) the number of high value targets killed in territories managed by individual Taliban commanders.The data is obtained from press reports from the Pakistani press (Daily Times, Dawn, Geo News, The News, and other outlets), as well as wire reports (AFP, Reuters, etc.), as well as reporting from The Long War Journal. Given the Taliban's control of the areas where strikes occur, and a dearth of reporters in those areas, the exact numbers for casualties are difficult to know. The numbers below are estimates based on press reporting.For a list of al Qaeda and Taliban leaders thought to have been killed in the attacks, see LWJ report, Senior al Qaeda and Taliban leaders killed in US airstrikes in Pakistan 2004 - 2014.This page was last updated on Wednesday, January 28, 2015, 12:24 pm Eastern. These seven charts will be updated when information about prior or new strikes comes to light.Predator Strikes HistoryThe US ramped up the number of strikes in July 2008, and has continued to regularly hit at Taliban and Al Qaeda targets inside Pakistan. There have been 381 strikes total since the program began in 2004; 370 of those strikes have taken place since January 2008.Predator Strikes CasualtiesSince 2006, there have been 2,748 leaders and operatives from Taliban, Al Qaeda, and allied extremist groups killed and 156 civilians are estimated to have been killed. Data for 2004 and 2005 are not available at this time.Predator Strikes by District by YearOver the past six years, the strikes have focused on two regions: North and South Waziristan. Over the past two years, there has been a dramatic shift in the location of the strikes. In 2009, 42% of the strikes have taken place in North Waziristan and 51% in South Waziristan. In 2010, 89% of the strikes have taken place in North Waziristan and 6% in South Waziristan.Predator Strikes by DistrictOf the 381 strikes since 2004, 72% have hit targets in North Waziristan, and 23% have hit targets in South Waziristan.Predator Strikes by FactionThe majority of the attacks have taken place in the tribal areas administered by four powerful Taliban groups: the Mehsuds, Mullah Nazir, Hafiz Gul Bahadar, and the Haqqanis. In 2010, there was a dramatic shift in strikes to tribal areas administered by Hafiz Gul Bahadar.Predator Strikes by FactionMullah Nazir and Waliur Rehman are based in South Waziristan; the Haqqanis, Hafiz Gul Bahadar, and Abu Kasha al Iraqi are based in North Waziristan; Hakeemullah Mehsud is based in Arakzai; and Faqir Mohammed is based in Bajaur. Two bases operated by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar were hit in South Waziristan. For eight of the strikes, territorial control has not been reported.Predator Strikes and High-value TargetsThe Pakistani government considers Nazir (who has been killed in a US drone strike), the Haqqanis, Bahadar, and Hekmatyar to be 'good Taliban' as they do not carry out attacks against the Pakistani state. All of these Taliban factions shelter al Qaeda and various other terror groups.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Killer US <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim commanders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place northwest <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim leaders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Nazir <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer US <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim targets <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim leaders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "THE TWIN TOWERS; Deadly Bomb Was Cheap and Easily Made, Experts SayThe bomb that savaged the World Trade Center, investigators and explosive experts said yesterday, apparently was put together with ordinary chemicals that are widely and cheaply available at chemical supply houses and gardening centers throughout the country.Experts now estimate that the bomb weighed about 1,000 pounds and that the chemicals to make it were bought for a little more than $400.Though a young chemical engineer was arrested yesterday in connection with the explosion, the experts say that such a bomb could have been made by almost anyone with the help of one of scores of manuals, obtainable in bookstores and libraries, that provide step-by-step instructions.\"It's very easy to make one of these things,\" said Edward M.Roy, an explosives expert at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, N.M. \"I tell my students, a lot of explosives I can make in my wastebasket.\"A Jumble of ChemicalsFollowing the trail of Mohammed A. Salameh, the \ufb01rst suspect arrested in the bombing, investigators discovered a jumble of chemicals, chemistry implements and detonating materials stacked in a storage locker at 69 Mallory Avenue in Jersey City that they say may also have served as the bomb laboratory.The day before the explosion that killed at least \ufb01ve people and injured more than 1,000 others, Mr.Salameh and several other men made \"numerous trips\" to the locker, which Mr.Salameh had rented for $97 a month late last year, the authorities say.The suspects traveled in a yellow Ford van, the investigators say, which has been identi\ufb01ed as the vehicle that carried the explosive into the underground garage of the World Trade Center.A Thick PasteThe investigators and experts say that after mixing the three main chemicals -- nitric and sulfuric acids and urea, a common ingredient in fertilizers -- into a thick paste, the bombers are believed to have packed the material into half a dozen or so cardboard boxes.They simply loaded the boxes loosely into the van, without using a special container for them, the investigators believe, and drove across the Hudson River to the trade center.The bombers ignited their concoction, investigators believe, with several smaller nitroglycerine bombs, which themselves were touched off with the kind of blasting cap routinely used at construction and mining sites across the country.The blasting cap is the only ingredient in the deadly mix, the experts and law-enforcement of\ufb01cials say, that requires a license or permit for purchase, and most probably was stolen.Manuals Were FoundThe investigators said they found manuals for bomb making in one of the apartments that they raided after arresting Mr.Salameh.Neil C.Livingstone, the president of the Institute on Terrorism and Sub-National Con\ufb02ict in Washington, said that as a test of how easy it was to obtain such guides to destruction, he recently wrote to a publishing house using a child's lined notepad and a crayon.Three of the bomb-making manuals were promptly delivered to the address Mr. Livingstone had given, he said, no questions asked.Though building the bomb was relatively easy, the experts say, it was not by any means free of danger.The bulkiest part of the bomb, they say, was extremely stable and could only have been touched off with a tremendous kick, like that provided by nitroglycerine.Making the nitroglycerine, by blending some of the chemicals, was the trickiest part of the process.As the chemicals are mixed to form this compound, said Dr. Per-Anders Persson, the director of the center for explosives research at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, they get hot and may explode.Often, he said, beakers are packed in dry ice to keep the chemicals at a safe temperature.A Dangerous MixThe nitroglycerine could have also exploded prematurely with any jolt or sharp change in temperature, the experts said.The bombers risked blowing themselves up as well, the experts said, when they hooked up the wires connecting the bomb's trigger with the blasting cap.Dr.Robert H. Kupperman, a senior adviser for science and technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University, said that perhaps the greatest skill in making the bomb came in rigging the chain of triggering explosives so they all tore into the bulk of the bomb for maximum effect, as investigators at the World Trade Center say apparently happened.So far, in more than a week of searching, they have not found a single grain of the main explosive material.Sulfuric Acid Widely SoldWilliam Lazor, a senior technical consultant at the Du Pont Company in Wilmington, Del., said that sulfuric acid is the most widely sold chemical in the United States, used in the manufacture of everything from battery acid to detergents and shampoos.Dale Ladysh, another consultant at Du Pont, said that nitric acid is only slightly behind in popularity.It is used, he said, in the electronics industry and for making stainless steel and many industrial dies and pigmentations.Both acids are commonly used metal cleaners.According to Rick Amberg of Amberg Perennial Farm and Garden Center in West\ufb01eld, N.J., urea is often scattered over lawns to make them grow lustrously, and is also used in making plastics.Mr. Amberg sells a plastic 50-pound bag of urea for $20.99.In Newark, the Dooner & Smith Chemical Company sells a 15-gallon drum of sulfuric acid, weighing 172 pounds, for $41.28.The same size container of nitric acid costs $44 and weighs 220 pounds.\"Whoever put that thing together really intended to do a lot of damage,\" said Mr.Roy.\"This kind of explosive device is often used to fracture and move rock.It expands slowly with great force.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack savaged <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target World Trade Center <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble put together <extra_id_0> Components chemicals <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell bought <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity chemicals <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PaymentBarter $400 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee engineer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble make  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble make <extra_id_0> Artifact explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Mohammed A.

There was no information about how the four men might be involved in the attack.British interior minister Amber Rudd said Wednesday the suicide bomber, who has been identified as Salman Abedi, 22, was \"known\" by British intelligence services before the bombing.She also told the BBC that \"it seems likely, possible, that he wasn't doing this on his own.\"The blast at the conclusion of a concert by American pop star Ariana Grande at Manchester Arena killed 22 people and wounded 59 others. The attacker also died at the site.Police officers arrive at a residential property on Elsmore Road in Fallowfield, Manchester, on May 24, 2017, as investigations continue into the May 22 terror attack at the Manchester Arena.Investigation shifts to Abedi's activitiesInvestigators are now trying to figure out what Abedi was up to in his last days before the attack Monday.French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told BFM television on Wednesday that British and French intelligence have information that Abedi had likely traveled to Syria.According to Collomb, Abedi \u201cgrew up in Britain and then suddenly, after a trip to Libya and then likely to Syria, became radicalized and decided to carry out this attack.\u201d\"In any case, the links with Daesh (Islamic State) are proven,\" he said.Islamic State is claiming it was behind the attack, but neither British nor U.S. intelligence have confirmed that.Police officers stand guard in central Manchester, Britain, May 24, 2017 after Monday's suicide attack at an Ariana Grande concert.Terror level raised Britain raised its terrorism alert level to critical \u2013 the highest step \u2013 after the blast, signaling that another attack was highly likely and could be imminent.The change is most visible in the deployment of soldiers to help guard certain areas, including major events such as concerts and football matches, in order to free up police officers.Hopkins said an off-duty police officer was among those killed in the suicide attack, but it will take up to five days for authorities to identify all the victims.\u201cDue to number of victims the Home Office post-mortems are likely to take four to five days. After this we will be in a position to formerly name the victims,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have spoken to all of the families of those who lay injured in our hospitals.\u201dBritish Prime Minister Theresa May said in an address to the nation late Tuesday that authorities will do everything possible to protect the public and asked people to remain vigilant.\"I do not want the public to feel unduly alarmed. We have faced a serious terrorist threat in our country for many years,\" May said.People attend a vigil in Albert Square, Manchester, England, May 23, 2017, the day after the suicide attack at an Ariana Grande concert that left 22 people dead as it ended on Monday night.Maximum carnage Earlier in the day, she spoke more directly about the attack itself, saying the bomber chose the \"time and place to cause maximum carnage and to kill and injure indiscriminately.\"Many of the victims were young girls, with the youngest identified so far being just 8-year-old.Video from the arena showed the joy in the audience at the end of the concert turning to confusion and then to panic and a scramble to get out of the building as the realization of what just happened spread.Witness say they saw blood covered bodies on the floor while others, badly wounded, staggered toward the exits of the building.The scene outside the concert hall was also chaotic, with traffic snarled and parents rushing to the scene.Britain's Queen Elizabeth held a moment of silence at a garden party at Buckingham Palace.

{"text": "Republican News \u00b7 Thursday 6 December 2001McGurk's bomb relatives call for inquiryBY LAURA FRIELCalls for an inquiry accompanied the 30th anniversary commemoration of the 15 people who died and 16 who were seriously injured in the McGurk's bar bombing of 1971. Relatives of the victims, who held a memorial service in Belfast this week, are calling for an investigation into allegations of crown force collusion in the UVF bomb attack.Thirty years ago this week, on 4 December 1971, a UVF gang placed a bomb in the hallway of McGurk's bar in North Queens Street. Amongst the dead, which included children and pensioners, were several members of the bar owner, Patrick McGurk's family, who were upstairs in the living area at the time of the explosion. The building collapsed, trapping many of the victims under the rubble.Alex McLaughlin, whose father was killed in the attack, said there was a massive Crown force presence in the area in the week prior to the bombing in contrast to the night of the atttack.\"Two days earlier, three men had escaped from Crumlin Road jail and the RUC had swamped the area looking for them,\" said Alex. \"It seems strange that loyalists would choose that time to drive from Tigers Bay into a Catholic area to plant a bomb.\"Despite an eyewitness account identifying the bombing crew and the fact that the bombing was claimed by loyalists in the immediate aftrermath of the attack, the British authorities blamed the IRA.Journalists were briefed by senior members of the British Army, who claimed forensic evidence confirmed republicans were responsible for the explosion.In her study, \"Ireland: the Propaganda War,\" Liz Curtis describes how the British Army and RUC, with the assistance of much of the press, successfully diverted attention from the evidence of loyalist involvement and used the atrocity to discredit their principle enemy, the IRA.\"The McGurk's bar bombing had caused more casualties than any single previous incident,\" said Curtis, \"loyalists were responsible but never stood publicly condemned for it beyond nationalist areas.\"In 1978, a self-confessed UVF member, Robert Campbell, was convicted of the bombing together with the 1976 sectarian killing of John Morrow, a workman mistaken for a Catholic.Pat Arthurs, who was 14 years of age when her mother was killed in the bombing, has described how the 'disinformation' peddled by the RUC and British army left her confused and made it more difficult for her family to come to terms with the loss. Pat's father, who was also in McGurk's, survived the attack.In her heart, Pat always knew the bombing had been carried out by loyalists but there was always a doubt. And then there was the stigma. \"I had to grow up with people saying that maybe my mother or father had something to do with the murder of 15 people,\" said Pat.Mary Irvine, whose mother was killed in the bombing, said that while everyone else seemed to have forgotten about what happened, the people of the New Lodge Road and local community have supported relatives and survivors for thirty years.Mary particularly remembered the late Paddy McManus, a local Sinn Fein Councillor \"who had kept the memory of what happened in McGurk's alive.\"Almost a thousand people packed St. Patrick's Chapel on Donegall Street for a memorial mass this week. Following the service fifteen wreaths, one for each victim, were carried by relatives leading a silent candlelit procession to a new memorial at Great George's Street.At the site where so many had died, Fr David White condemned 'careless reporting' which had added to the grief.\"The bombing of Paddy McGurk's was a callous and cowardly sectarian act,\" said Fr White, \"and the enormous pain inflicted by the death of so many was intensified when the army and police personnel, together with the media, rushed to blame republicans.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 16 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place McGurk's bar <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle collapsed <extra_id_0> Artifact building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim father <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack atttack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation drive <extra_id_0> Origin Tigers Bay <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination area <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transporter loyalists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker loyalists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place bar <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die casualties  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant Robert Campbell <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim John Morrow <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer Robert Campbell <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim mother <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim mother <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim many <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Paddy McGurk's <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die death <extra_id_0> Victim many <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

That was certainly the case here on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 17, 2011.I shudder to think how different things would have been for us were it not for three temporary workers who were pulling a shift for the city\u2019s Public Utilities District: Mark Steiner, Brandon Klaus and Sherman Welpton.Ring a bell? Didn\u2019t with me, either.I\u2019m embarrassed to say that I had to do a computer search to get the names of the trio that arguably saved Spokane from a Boston-like carnage.The men noticed the backpack. It had been placed along the route soon to be filled with marchers honoring the late civil rights leader. They could have just as easily ignored it, but they didn\u2019t. They opened the package, saw wires and called authorities.Eric Olsen and Jason Hartman, two police sergeants, smoothly ordered the march diverted.It took some time, but the clues led investigators to the cancer behind this mad act: Kevin W. Harpham, a 36-year-old self-avowed white supremacist from rural Addy, Wash.Racist. Islamic fanatics \u2026 A terrorist by any other name still stinks the same.In federal court, Harpham made a ludicrous and failed attempt to dismiss his unexploded handiwork as a \u201ccreative\u201d protest against the so-called evils of multiculturalism.Those in the know say Harpham\u2019s bomb was beyond diabolical. Laced with rat poison, the weapon was designed to be detonated from as far as 1,000 feet away. Dozens could have died or been mutilated horribly.Harpham was sentenced to 32 years in prison, the maximum allowed under a plea bargain struck between Harpham\u2019s attorneys and prosecutors.That still doesn\u2019t seem like enough.It\u2019s easy to take for granted the things that don\u2019t happen, but watching the horrors unfold in Boston should drive home just how lucky we were.Limbs blown off. Lives lost. In an eye blink, one of the nation\u2019s most revered athletic events had turned into a bloody war zone.Then things got even more surreal.Carjacking. Kidnapping. A police officer killed. Citizens told to stay in their homes.Before last Monday, would anyone have imagined that two angry young men could paralyze a city such as Boston?And who would imagine that Spokane would be spared by the grace of God and a few contract workers?It\u2019s true.

{"text": "SURREY, British Columbia \u2014 A Boston Marathon-style attack on Canada Day festivities Monday was disrupted when the Mounties nabbed an al-Qaeda-inspired couple and seized pressure cooker bombs, police said.John Stewart Nuttall and Amanda Marie Korody were inspired by al-Qaeda ideology but were self-radicalized, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner James Malizia said yesterday. He called it a domestic threat without international connections.Malizia said there was no evidence to suggest a link to the deadly Boston Marathon bombings in April. But the plot outlined by the RCMP appears to parallel the case in Boston, where federal prosecutors say the Tsarnaev brothers learned how to make pressure cooker bombs from an online al-Qaeda magazine, and downloaded Islamic extremist texts meant to inspire lone wolves who operate on their own initiative.Nuttall and Korody were arrested on Monday, the same day that thousands attended the Canada Day celebrations at the provincial legislature in Victoria.

{"text": "DIY Drone Instructable: How To Deliver a PayloadOverviewThese instructions guide you to build a DIY payload delivery drone system that can be mounted on your drone/quadcopter and used to deliver a package to any address.The smart, low-cost delivery solution uses GPS to find its destination and then employs an ultrasonic sensor to measure the ground clearance.Depending on your drone capabilities, this payload system can lift up to 2kg freight.A servo motor is used to release the payload at the desired location.This guide also provides a solution to the sensor integration problem.You can integrate GPS, servo, and ultrasonic sensors without any serial interference.DIY payload delivery drone systemComponentsBreadboardArduino Mega/UnoServo motor SG90Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04GPS module NEO-6M-001Connecting wiresA bottle capGlue/TapeHair pinBreadboardArduino Mega/UnoServo motor SG90Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04GPS module NEO-6M-001connecting wiresbottle caphair pinStep 1: Connecting the Ultrasonic SensorTake the breadboard and affix the Arduino to its one side, as shown in the picture.Now, take the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and attach it to the lower side of the breadboard.Make the connections as shown in Figure 1.Connect the pins as follows:Vcc (Ultrasonic) -> 5V (Arduino)GND (Ultrasonic) -> GND (Arduino)Trig pin (Ultrasonic) -> pin 8 (Arduino)Echo pin (Ultrasonic) -> pin 9 (Arduino)Run the following code to check if the ultrasonic sensor is functional.The Serial Monitor will show the following output:Step 2: Connecting the GPS ModuleTake the NEO-6M GPS module and insert its pins into the breadboard.Make connections as shown in Figure 2.Don\u2019t forget to download TinyGPS++ library if missing.Connect the pins as follows:Vcc (GPS module) -> 3.3V (Arduino)2GND (GPS module) -> GND (Arduino)RX pin (GPS module) -> pin 1 (Arduino)TX pin (GPS module) -> pin 0 (Arduino)Figure 2Run the following code and check if the GPS sensor is functional.DON\u2019T FORGET to remove the TX pin of GPS module from pin 0 of Arduino; otherwise, your code won\u2019t upload.Once the code is uploaded, first open Serial Monitor; then, connect the TX pin of GPS to pin 0 to view the current location of drone, time, and date.The Serial Monitor will show output:Step 3: Connecting the Bottle CapNow, take a bottle cap to prepare the payload-releasing mechanism.The mechanism itself is simple.You hook the payload on the hairpin inside the bottle cap, and when the servo moves it pulls off the hairpin from the bottle cap, resulting the payload to drop.Make holes on both sides of the cap.Attach the cap on the lower side of the breadboard, as shown in the pictures.Step 4: Connecting the ServoFirst, take a hair pin and connect it to the limb of the servo using a staple, as shown in the picture.Take the servo and attach it under the breadboard such that the hair pin passes through both the holes of the bottle cap.Connect the Servo with Arduino in the following way, as shown in Figure 3.PWM Pin (Servo) -> Pin 14 (Arduino)Vcc Pin (Servo) -> 5V (Arduino)GND Pin (Servo) -> GND (Arduino)Figure 3It will look like this when you attach the whole system to your drone.Run the following code to check if the servo is functional.Step 5: Putting it All TogetherMake sure you make all the connections as shown in Figure 4.You\u2019ll integrate the sensors without using SoftwareSerial library.Employing hardware serial ports of your Arduino will minimize serial interference between libraries; hence, eliminating the servo vibration.Figure 4Open the Arduino window and paste the following code.In the code, set the desired GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude) where you need to drop off the basket.Once the desired location is added, click Upload.Again, don\u2019t forget to remove the TX pin of GPS from pin 0 before uploading the code.Upload the code on your Arduino and click the Serial Monitor icon in the top right corner.You\u2019ll see the current GPS coordinates of your drone.Let your drone fly to the desired location.When your drone reaches the desired address, bring it closer to the ground.The ultrasonic sensor will calculate the ground clearance.When it\u2019s about 15 cm, the servo releases the payload.The serial monitor prompts you when the package is delivered, and records the time as well.After dropping the payload, fly your drone back to its initial point.Precaution DO NOT put more than 2 kg load in the basket otherwise it will damage the assembly.Also be sure to check the spec of your drone so you will know how much weight that drone can handle.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Transportation Deliver <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Payload <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation deliver <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact package <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transporter your <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone/quadcopter <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination address <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation fly <extra_id_0> Transporter your <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination desired location <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation fly <extra_id_0> Transporter your <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination initial point <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble mounted <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler you <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components DIY payload delivery drone system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact drone/quadcopter <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble build <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler you <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact DIY payload delivery drone system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection measure <extra_id_0> Instrument ultrasonic sensor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle release <extra_id_0> Components payload <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument servo motor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place desired location <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble integrate <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler You <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components servo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact ultrasonic sensors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble affix <extra_id_0> Components Arduino <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact breadboard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble attach <extra_id_0> Components HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact breadboard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Connecting <extra_id_0> Components GPS Module <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble insert <extra_id_0> Components pins <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact breadboard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Connecting <extra_id_0> Components Bottle Cap <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Connecting <extra_id_0> Components Servo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Connect <extra_id_0> Components Servo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact Arduino <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection calculate <extra_id_0> Instrument ultrasonic sensor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation reaches <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination desired address, <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection find <extra_id_0> Instrument GPS <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble attach <extra_id_0> Components whole system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle remove <extra_id_0> Components GPS module <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble connect <extra_id_0> Components GPS <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Attach <extra_id_0> Components cap <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble integrate <extra_id_0> Components sensors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle releases <extra_id_0> Components payload <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact servo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "There have been many terrible events in the history of Northern Ireland's conflict, but few have seared the collective consciousness of its people as those on Friday, 21 July 1972, a day that became known as Bloody Friday.By the end of the day, the IRA's Belfast brigade had detonated at least 20 bombs across the city.In just 75 minutes of violence, nine people were dead and some 130 more were mutilated, injured and mentally scarred by what they had witnessed.You could hear people screaming, crying and moaning. The first thing that caught my eye was a torso of a human being in the middle of the streetPolice officer at the sceneFrom the outset, the IRA's bombing of the city caused widespread chaos and stretched the security forces to the limit.Such was the scale of the attack, witnesses at the time remember seeing people running in all directions, not knowing where the bombs were being detonated.As one report at the time described the scene, \"it was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe\".Car bombsWhile the scale of the attack was huge, it was two car bombs that between them claimed the nine lives - one at the Oxford Street bus station in the city centre, the other outside shops in Cavehill Road in north Belfast.At Oxford St, the busiest bus station in Northern Ireland, four Ulsterbus workers and two soldiers were killed.When the emergency services reached the scene, they found that some of the victims had been literally blown to pieces, leading to initial estimates of a death toll of 11.At the Cavehill Road bomb, the victims were two women and a 14-year-old schoolboy.Of the 130 injured, 77 were women or children out shopping in the city centre. One police officer at the scene recalled the events for the BBC series Provos in 1997.\"You could hear people screaming, crying and moaning. The first thing that caught my eye was a torso of a human being lying in the middle of the street,\" he told the series.Collapsed ceasefireIn terms of furthering its cause among nationalists, the IRA's decision to carry out the Bloody Friday attacks proved to be a disaster.Earlier in the year, the IRA had experienced a massive propaganda and recruitment boost after the Parachute Regiment killed 13 protesters during Bloody Sunday in Derry. Many joined believing that they had no other way to defend their communities.It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time.Former IRA leader Sean MacStiofainBy June, the organisation felt confident enough to call a ceasefire and hold secret talks with British ministers in London. Those talks came to nothing and the ceasefire collapsed.Bloody Friday was part of a deliberate decision to ratchet up a campaign and make normal life impossible.But after causing the deaths, the IRA tried to blame the security forces for failing to act on warnings.Ultimately Bloody Friday revealed a side to the organisation that many who had joined in the wake of Bloody Sunday had not wished to acknowledge.Within 10 days of the attacks, the army moved in to the Bogside area of Derry to take control of a part of the city that had become out-of-bounds, marking the beginning of a long war of attrition by both sides.DenialsIn later years, an IRA leader at the time, Sean MacStiofain, said that the aim of the Bloody Friday attacks had been to cause financial damage - but he still refused to accept responsibility.\"It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time,\" he said.\"Republicans were convinced that the British had deliberately disregarded these two warnings for strategic policy reasons.\"Bloody Friday was by no means the last atrocity of 1972. It remains the bloodiest year of the conflict in Northern Ireland.By the end of 1972, 496 had been killed, 258 of them civilians.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack conflict  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker brigade <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place city <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure mutilated <extra_id_0> Victim more <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim more <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place city <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim 496 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 130 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim protesters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer Parachute Regiment <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Derry <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim workers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Oxford St <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die claimed <extra_id_0> Victim nine lives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Cavehill Road <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack those  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation reached <extra_id_0> Transporter services <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination scene <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die blown <extra_id_0> Victim victims <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die death <extra_id_0> Victim 11 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die bomb <extra_id_0> Victim victims <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact recalled <extra_id_0> Participant BBC <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand call <extra_id_0> Communicator organisation <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact hold <extra_id_0> Participant organisation <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation moved <extra_id_0> Transporter army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination area <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack war  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Sean MacStiofain <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack conflict  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Image caption Naser Jason Abdo planned the attack outside Fort Hood so he would not have to get past securityA US soldier convicted of plotting to blow up a restaurant full of troops in Texas has been sentenced to life in jail.The former Army Pfc, Naser Jason Abdo, was found guilty in May of six federal offences, including attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction.The 22-year-old said last year he had planned a \"massive attack\" against soldiers stationed at Fort Hood.He went Awol in Kentucky just before his arrest near Fort Hood in 2011.At the time of his arrest, the authorities found bomb-making materials in his motel room.Abdo, a Muslim convert and Texas native, refused to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan from Fort Campbell in Kentucky, before going missing on 4 July 2011.'Allah gives mercy'He said he was planning a religious mission to secure \"justice\" for the people of those countries, in a recorded conversation with his mother that was played during his trial.Abdo represented himself after telling a judge he was not communicating well with his lawyer.Image caption Abdo said he had been inspired by Army psychiatrist Nidal Hasan, who killed 13 people at Fort HoodHe appeared in court with a white cloth bound across his mouth and a black mesh over his hair and face - earlier this year he attempted to spit what he apparently thought was HIV-infected blood on three officers.Abdo made a long, meandering statement to the court in which he said he would pursue jihad \"until the day the dead are called to account for their deeds\".\"I don't ask the court for mercy because Allah is the one that gives mercy,\" he said. He spoke Arabic intermittently during his statement, and then translated for the court.He was also convicted of attempted murder of US officers or employees, and four counts of possessing a weapon in furtherance of a federal crime of violence.Abdo told police in a recorded interview he planned the attack \"because I don't appreciate what my unit did in Afghanistan\".According to authorities, he intended to set off a bomb in a Chinese restaurant popular with Fort Hood soldiers and their families. Then Abdo planned to wait outside and shoot any survivors.He believed he would become a martyr when police killed him, they added.Abdo referred to Maj Nidal Hasan, an army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 people in a 2009 shooting at Fort Hood, and told the court he remained in the accused's shadow despite \"efforts to outdo him\".", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker Naser Jason Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Fort Hood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blow up <extra_id_0> Attacker US soldier <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target troops <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Texas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict guilty <extra_id_0> Defendant Naser Jason Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Fort Hood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Fort Hood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place motel room <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing trial <extra_id_0> Defendant Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt judge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing telling <extra_id_0> Defendant Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt judge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing appeared <extra_id_0> Defendant He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing statement <extra_id_0> Defendant Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack murder <extra_id_0> Target officers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> Target soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Chinese restaurant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shooting <extra_id_0> Attacker Maj Nidal Hasan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Fort Hood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The King's Cross station and Euston station bombings were two bombing attacks on 10 September 1973 by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) that targeted two mainline railway stations in central London. The blasts wounded 13 civilians, some of whom were seriously injured, and also caused large-scale but superficial damage. This was a second wave of bombing attacks launched by the IRA in England in 1973 after the Old Bailey car bombing earlier in the year which had killed one  and injured around 200 civilians.==Background==In 1971, during The Troubles, after two years engaged in violence based on a defensive strategy in Irish communal districts of Northern Ireland, the Provisional IRA launched an offensive against the United Kingdom. At a meeting of the IRA Army Council in June 1972 the organization's Chief of Staff, Se\u00e1n Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in, first proposed making bombing attacks in England. The Army Council did not at first agree to the suggestion, but in early 1973 after its negotiations with the British Government for a truce the previous year had failed to advance the political objective of the removal of Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom by the application of the threat of violence, it re-engaged its paramilitary campaign and sanctioned Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in's proposal. Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in had put the strategy forward on the basis that extending the urban paramilitary violence of the Northern Ireland state into England would help to relieve pressure being exerted by the British Army on the IRA's strongholds of Irish communal support in districts in the province, such as West Belfast and Derry, by diverting British security strength from them back into England, whilst at the same time increasing strategic pressure upon the British Government to resolve the conflict by political concessions to the IRA's demands. He also believed that a successful bombing campaign in London, as the capital city of the United Kingdom, would offer substantial propaganda value for paramilitary Irish Republicanism, and provide a morale boost to its supporters.The effects of the previous 1973 Old Bailey bombing appeared to give some credence to the idea of the propaganda value of extending violence into London as, although it would have been considered almost routine in Northern Ireland by the mid-1970s and have drawn only brief media notice, being carried out instead in London, a global capital city, had made the event world news headlines. However, although the bombing of the Old Bailey had been successfully carried out, and had gained media attention, increasing political pressure upon the British Government to address the issue of the conflict in Northern Ireland with more urgency, it had been costly to the IRA, as 10 out of the 11 man Active Service Unit that had carried it out had been arrested by the British police whilst trying to leave England before the bombs they had planted detonated. Drawing the tactical lesson that large teams were a security liability, for the second wave of bombings in England later in 1973, instead of sending a large team to carry it out with orders to withdraw back to Ireland immediately afterwards, smaller detached \"cell\" units of about 3-4 personnel were sent to carry out the operation, with instructions to remain in England afterwards and wage a campaign of bombings around England upon a variety of targets.There were bombings on 8 September 1973, including one at Victoria railway station which injured four civilians.==Bombings==On 10 September 1973 a bomb (with no warning issued beforehand) exploded at King's Cross railway station in the booking hall at 12.24 p.m. when a youth of around 16/17 years of age walked up to the entrance of the station's old booking hall and threw a bag into it which contained a 3\u00a0lb (1.4\u00a0kg) device, which detonated, shattering glass throughout the hall and throwing a baggage trolley several feet into the air. The youth then fled into the station's crowd and escaped the scene.Approximately 45 minutes after the attack at King's Cross, after a telephone called warning 5 minutes beforehand by a man with an Irish accent to the Press Association, a second bomb detonated in a snack bar at Euston railway station, injuring another eight civilians. One witness at Euston said: \"I saw a flash and suddenly people were being thrown through the air - it was a terrible mess, they were bleeding and screaming\" A total of 13 civilians were injured in the two attacks. The Metropolitan Police issued a photofit picture of a 5\u00a0ft 2 tall 16/17-year-old youth they were seeking in regard to the King's Cross attack.==Subsequent events==On 12 September 1973 two more bombs exploded, one in Oxford Street and another in Sloane Square, targeting retail shopping centres. Police subsequently announced that they were looking for five people in connection with this second wave of bomb attacks in England.Judith Ward was later wrongly convicted for having been involved in the late 1973 London bombings, along with the M62 coach bombing. She was later acquitted. No one else was brought to trial for this IRA bombing campaign.==See also==*Bombings of Paddington and Victoria stations *Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1970\u201379)==Sources==* CAIN project * BBC ON THIS DAY  Bomb blasts rock central London ==References==", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target Euston station <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place England <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target Old Bailey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Place England <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Se\u00e1n Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target Old Bailey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target Old Bailey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Attacker England <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Target Victoria railway station <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target hall <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack threw <extra_id_0> Attacker youth <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure bleeding <extra_id_0> Victim they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target King's Cross <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Sloane Square <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target centres <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place England <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant Judith Ward <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Place London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target M62 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack Bombings <extra_id_0> Target stations <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice Bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Mariana Zu\u00f1igaSpecial for USA TODAYCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Venezuelan election officials said 8 million people voted Sunday to create a constitutional assembly endowing President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro with virtually unlimited powers, a vote total decried by domestic and foreign critics as a sham.Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council's estimated turnout Sunday was more than double that of political opponents and independent experts.Opposition leaders also said 12 people were killed in violence in the face of a massive presence of troops around the country on Sunday. The government confirmed nine deaths.Maduro, who faces a worsening economic crisis despite Venezuela's enormous oil reserves, seeks to establish a friendly assembly that would bypass the opposition-controlled Congress to rewrite the country\u2019s 1999 constitution. Opponents accuse him of trying to create a single-party, authoritarian system like that in Cuba.Electoral Council President Tibisay Lucena announced just before midnight Sunday that turnout was 41.53%, or 8,089,320 people.The count was met with mockery and anger from members of the opposition, who said they believed between 2 million and 3 million people voted.Julio Borges, president of the opposition-led National Assembly, said only 7% of the electorate had voted \u2014 a silent protest of Maduro's power grab, which would slam the brakes on democracy.The opposition had urged voters to boycott the vote, but millions of Venezuelans who hold government jobs were ordered to cast ballots or risk being fired.Others feared loss of social benefits like subsidized food. \u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m hoping for housing,\u201d admitted hairdresser Luisa Marquez, 46, as she waited in line to vote.Opinion polls had indicated that more than two-thirds of the nation opposed the president's move. The opposition said 7 million had voted against constitutional changes in a referendum it had organized a week ago.A midday check of 10 polling places here in the capital Sunday showed most of them empty or nearly empty.\u201cVenezuela has screamed with its silence,\u201d said Borges, who put the day's death toll at 12. The public prosecutor's office confirmed nine deaths.Maduro's vision of a new constitution to consolidate his power has drawn ire in Washington. Last week, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on 13 senior Venezuelan officials, and the White House and some U.S. lawmakers said stiffer sanctions could follow. Mexico said it would support U.S. sanctions, and the Organization of American States and the European Parliament have also expressed support for the opposition.Late Sunday, the U.S. State Department officially condemned the Venezuelan government for holding the vote, saying Maduro's bid to consolidate power would \u201cundermine the Venezuelan people\u2019s right to self-determination.\u201dU.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has called the vote a \u201csham election.\u201dIn Venezuela, opposition leaders refused to put up candidates, arguing that the election has been structured to ensure that Maduro\u2019s ruling socialist party dominates. Thus virtually all the more than 5,000 candidates for 545 assembly seats are Maduro supporters.The opposition vowed to protest despite a ban on public gatherings issued by Maduro. In some parts of the capital, people took to the streets in protest against the vote, but they were soon repelled by security forces throwing tear gas.During a protest, opposition supporters set an explosive that injured seven police officers, the public prosecutor's office said. After the blast, police set fire to four motorcycles belonging to journalists.Read more:After months of fatal protests, Venezuela braces for controversial vote SundayWhy this vote in Venezuela is so importantMaduro has struggled with a rapidly deteriorating economy and strengthening political opposition. Some voters said they believed the new assembly might improve life in Venezuela.\u201cI\u2019m voting today because I want peace to be restored,\u201d said seamstress Carmen Martinez, 44. But she said she was less certain the assembly will solve the nation's economic ills.\"I\u2019m going to have hope, but I doubt this could solve that problem,\" she said.Months of violence leading up to the vote showed little signs of ending, with media reporting that a leading assembly candidate and an opposition activist were killed before voting even began.Jos\u00e9 Felix Pineda, a lawyer running in the election, was shot in his home Saturday night, a senior Venezuelan minister told the BBC.Maduro has denied links to violent paramilitaries that have run roughshod across the country, blaming the opposition for unrelenting violence that has left more than 100 people dead.Maduro himself voted with little fanfare early in the morning.\u201cWe\u2019ve stoically withstood the terrorist, criminal violence,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully the world will respectfully extend its arms toward our country.\u201dOpposition leader Henrique Capriles called on Venezuelans to protest on Monday.Contributing: The Associated Press.

On the afternoon of November 21, with emotions running high, all police leave was cancelled and an extra 1,300 officers were drafted in to guard his coffin as it was driven to Coventry airport and flown to Ireland.But hours after the funeral procession, two bombs exploded in two packed Birmingham city centre pubs.It has been claimed that a 'link man' ordered the revenge attacks in an impulsive grief-stricken reaction to McDade's death - without the blessing of IRA chiefs in Belfast. The secret figure, whose identity has never been revealed, is believed to have then left for Ireland to attend the funeral and has remained there ever since.Another theory is that the bombings were revenge attacks for the Loyalist Dublin and Monaghan bombings six months earlier.Thirty four people died in the Ulster Volunteer Force attacks, labelled the worst atrocity of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It has been claimed the British security forces colluded with the loyalist terrorists in the bombings.Mick Murray was one of three men arrested along with the Birmingham Six by West Midlands Police in the immediate aftermath of the pub blasts.It has been claimed that Murray, who died in 1999, helped choose the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town as targets.And he was named as being one of the bomb-makers who transported the explosives to the city centre before handing them to the men who planted them.But, it is claimed Murray then botched a telephone warning made to our sister newspaper The Birmingham Post. It was supposed to give half an hour for the pubs to be cleared. But his warning, using the codeword Double X, came just six minutes before the first explosion - and did not name either pub.Murray admitted being a member of the IRA after his arrest. But West Midlands Police never charged him with murder and he served 12 years in jail for conspiracy to cause explosions.In 1990 his name was mentioned in a report handed to the Government by the Who Bombed Birmingham? Granada TV programme.The show was based on a book by campaigning MP, Chris Mullin, who said he met the real bombers, but could not reveal their identity.In another Parliamentary report, the MP stated the programme-makers had also passed a Special Branch document containing details of interviews with an IRAman to the Home Office. The unnamed terrorist had been arrested in November 1975 - six months after the trial and conviction of the Birmingham Six.Mr Mullin claimed the terrorist gave police accurate information including the names of some of those whom he said were responsible for the bombs.Crucially, the papers contained the remark: 'So-and-so told me he put one of the bombs in the pub.'AlongwithMurrayand the Birmingham Six two other men - including James Kelly - were arrested in the immediate aftermath of the carnage.Kelly was found guilty of possessing explosives and bizarrely claimed he was a spy who infiltrated the IRA so he could later give help to the police.The Birmingham Six were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1975 for the pub bombings. They were all Belfast born but had lived in Brum since the 1960s.Five of them had left the city on the early evening of November 21 from New Street Station - hours before the explosions - to travel to Belfast to attend McDade's funeral. They were seen off by Callaghan.The five were arrested at Heysham that evening and Callaghan was taken into custody the next day.All the men were interrogated by Birmingham CID and claimed at trial they were beaten, threatened and forced to sign statements written by the police over three days of questioning.Their convictions were overturned by the Court of Appeal in March1991and their case is seen as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British legal history.Terrorist activity was rife in the Midlands during the 1970sand police arrested scores of IRA members in the months following the bombings.But the IRA unit which gained particular notoriety was the Birmingham Nine. They were responsible for 20 of the 31 bomb blasts in Birmingham and parts of the West Midlands between August 1973 and August 1974.Patrick Guilfoyle, Martin Coughlan, Gerard Young, Joseph Duffy, Michael Murray, Anthony Madigan, Joseph Ashe, Gerald Small and Stephen Blake conducted the biggest wave of bombings in the region since the Second World War.Coughlan and Young were said to be the leading figures in the campaign.Coughlan was born in Dublin and came to Birmingham in 1956. He rented a house in Chelmsley Wood with his wife and had three children.It is believed he was the brains behind the campaign of terror which began in Birmingham and spread to Manchester.Guilfoyle never quite made the grade of bomber. He caused an explosion that badly injured one of his IRA colleagues because he was smoking a cigarette while making a bomb.Northern Ireland historian David McVea said: 'Many different theories have been put forward as to who actually carried out the bombings, but it is unlikely that the true culprits will ever be identified.'The IRA was very protective of its members at the time, people moved in and out of the different cells constantly. 'As well as the killing of so many innocent people the real tragedy is the wrongful jailing of the Birmingham Six.'The IRA was able to use the injustice against these men to their advantage for years.'CAPTION(S):SLAUGHTERED: victims are taken away from the pub bombings; DEVASTATED: wreckage outside the Tavern in the Town; DEAD: James McDade; TRIBUTE: memorial to the victims", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Attacker Mick Murray <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target two pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham city <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain jailed <extra_id_0> Detainee The nine men <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant Birmingham Nine <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham city <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target pubs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict served <extra_id_0> Prosecutor West Midlands Police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee terrorist <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict conviction <extra_id_0> Defendant Birmingham Six <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee James Kelly <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentenced <extra_id_0> Defendant Birmingham Six <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime interrogated <extra_id_0> Defendant men <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Investigator Birmingham CID <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts <extra_id_0> Place Birmingham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Attacker Patrick Guilfoyle <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place region <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "ISIS Is Reportedly Packing Drones With Explosives NowAn unconfirmed report from Syria suggests that ISIS has started using small drones packed with explosives as weapons.The first attack was a failure, but if the report is accurate, then it signals a dangerous new terror threat.The report showed pictures of the remains of a homemade attack drone.It was apparently shot down, along with a second drone that exploded, by Kurdish YPF (\"People's Defence Units\") fighters in Syria.The caption says that both drones carried explosives, and that no YPF fighters were injured in the incident.Unlike many jihadi groups, ISIS has proven itself tech-savvy\u2014the organization is known for its use of social media, for instance.This latest development is not surprising, as it follows a long history of drone usage.In late 2014, during the battle for Kobane, ISIS started using footage taken from dronesin their propaganda videos.Around the same time, ISIS started using quadrotors for battlefield reconnaissance.A number of them, mainly DJI quadrotors, were reportedly shot down or captured by Kurdish fighters, according to a news report from December 2014.These drones were apparently used as artillery spotters, finding targets and correcting the fall or fire for mortar crews.By early this year, ISIS drones had become important enough to be targeted by U.S. airstrikes.A CENTCOM report in March mentions that \"Near Fallujah, an airstrike destroyed an ISIL remotely piloted aircraft and an ISIL vehicle.\"\"We observed it flying for approximately 20 minutes.We observed it land.We observed the enemy place it in the trunk of a car and we struck the car,\" according to Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren.Warren described the drone as \"a model airplane\" and \"commercially available, remotely piloted aircraft, really something anyone can get.\"Another ISIS drone (\"remotely piloted vehicle\") was destroyed in an airstrike in June, and a third in August.Friends of YPG YPJIn fact, ISIS tactical drones seem to be appearing all over this year.In September the Levant Front (or Jabhat al-Shamiyya) released pictures of a camera-carrying Talon drone they brought down, which they say was flown by ISIS.The X-UAV Talon is available in kit form for about $100; it is made of plywood with a six-foot wingspan and has a large fuselage compartment for cameras or other payloads.In October, Iraqi police shot down a fixed-wing ISIS drone near Ramadi.Again it was of the small, hand-launched variety, though a different model, and the Iraqis say it was photographing military units.Even al-Qaeda has released pictures and video of what is claims was a downed ISIS drone.This flurry of drone activity is a reflection of just how easy it has become to acquire and fly drones.Just as home computers were once confined to dedicated hobbyists but found a wider market, drones have broken into the mainstream with models that require no piloting or technical skills to fly.This gives ISIS access to aerial reconnaissance that would otherwise be impossible in the face of the air superiority of Syrian, Russian, and Western forces.The pictures of the ISIS attack drone were posted by a user called \"Catelyn Carrigan\" on the Facebook page of the group \"Friends of the YPG YPJ\" with the headline \"YPG Shoots Down 2 ISIS Drones.\"The location of the new pictures is given as \"Southern Koban\u00ea, Qracoezag province near the bridge.\"We received no response to queries for more information on the pictures.This would not be the first terrorist drone strike.Hamas and Hezbollah, for example, both have used fixed-wing kamikaze drones with explosive warheads, but those were larger, modified versions of military Mirsad and Ababbil drones supplied by Iran.The ISIS drones do not rely on imported military technology, but can be assembled in a garage, for cheap.Some eagled-eyed redditors believe the drone in question today is the Skwalker X7 or X8, which costs $179 for the kit.As we've recently noted, small drones make effective battlefield weapons.The Switchblade by American company AeroVironment and the Israeli Hero-30 have both proven lethal, giving a foot soldier the power to launch his own airstrike to locate and hit a target from several miles away from behind cover.These military drones boast jam-proof communications, sophisticated terminal guidance, and advanced warheads.But even a crude, home-made version might be deadly in a terrorist attack against a soft target.During the recent terror attacks in Paris, the attackers were unable to gain access to the Stade de France, which was packed with fans for a soccer game.But drones cannot be stopped by walls or fences.While they can only carry a small amount of explosive compared to a suicide bomber, they can be deployed in significant numbers, and they can be directed with great accuracy against vulnerable targets.Of course, security forces are already looking at how to mitigate the threat from small drones, and various defensive measures are already in place, from nets to electronic detectors and jammers.Commercial drones can be stopped easily enough by jamming their control frequencies, or even hacking them to take over the drone, but purpose-built attack drones will be much harder to combat.Small drones can be built for a few thousand dollars in any home workshop.3D printed drones are no longer a novelty, and how-to guides can be shared easily over the internet.It is far too late to stop this technology from proliferating.ISIS first drone attack may have failed, but it is not likely to be the last.It may be time to get serious about defending against small drones.David Hambling's new bookSwarm Troopers: How small drones

While it was not our intention to injure or kill non-combatants, the reality is that on this and on a number of other occasions, that was the consequence of our actions. It is therefore appropriate on the anniversary of this tragic event, that we address all of the deaths and injuries of non-combatants caused by us. We offer our sincere apologies and condolences to their families. There have been fatalities amongst combatants on all sides. We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives. The future will not be found in denying collective failures and mistakes or closing minds and hearts to the plight of those who have been hurt. That includes all of the victims of the conflict, combatants and non-combatants. It will not be achieved by creating a hierarchy of victims in which some are deemed more or less worthy than others. The process of conflict resolution requires the equal acknowledgement of the grief and loss of others. On this anniversary, we are endeavouring to fulfil this responsibility to those we have hurt. The IRA is committed unequivocally to the search for freedom, justice and peace in Ireland. We remain totally committed to the peace process and to dealing with the challenges and difficulties which this presents. This includes the acceptance of past mistakes and of the hurt and pain we have caused to others.\" P O'Neill, Irish Republican Publicity Bureau, Dublin.The statement from the IRA was received by An Phoblacht (Republican News) on Tuesday, 16 July:", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim many <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injure <extra_id_0> Victim non-combatants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Victim non-combatants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths <extra_id_0> Victim non-combatants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Victim non-combatants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure hurt <extra_id_0> Victim those <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack conflict  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack conflict  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure hurt <extra_id_0> Injurer we <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim those <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact statement <extra_id_0> Participant An Phoblacht <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Suspect Charged in Boston BombingNineteen-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev now faces U.S. federal criminal charges in connection with last week\u2019s bombings at the Boston Marathon. If convicted, Tsarnaev could face the death penalty.One week after the two bombings that wreaked havoc near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was formally charged in a Boston hospital room, where he remains in serious but stable condition.A statement from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said Tsarnaev is charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction that resulted in death. A second charge of malicious destruction of property by an explosive device resulting in death also was filed. If he is found guilty of the federal charges, Tsarnaev might get the death penalty.Investigators reportedly have been questioning Tsarnaev, and he has been responding in writing. He is suffering from a gunshot wound to his throat. Officials say it is not clear if the wound was self-inflicted or came in the shootout with police in the Boston suburb of Watertown last week.Tsarnaev\u2019s older brother Tamerlan died in that same shootout.At the White House Monday, presidential spokesman Jay Carney said there is no doubt that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev eventually will face a trial in the civilian court system, and not through a military commission.Images of Boston Bombing SuspectsImages of Boston Bombing Suspects\u201cHe will not be treated as an enemy combatant. We will prosecute this terrorist through our civilian system of justice. Under U.S. law, United States citizens cannot be tried in military commissions and it is important to remember that since 9-11 we have used the federal court system to convict and incarcerate hundreds of terrorists,\u201d said Carney.Some Republican members of Congress have urged the Obama administration to designate Tsarnaev an enemy combatant for the purposes of more easily questioning him about his motivation for the Boston bombing, and whether he and his brother had links with terrorist groups.Senator Lindsay Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, spoke to reporters at the U.S. Capitol shortly after the criminal charges were announced.\u201cI hope that the administration will look long and hard at the evidence and keep on the table the ability to interrogate this suspect for intelligence gathering purposes about future attacks that we may face,\u201d said Graham.Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis told NBC\u2019s Today program that law enforcement officials are still trying to find out why the brothers allegedly carried out the bomb attacks last week.\u201cWe are satisfied that the two main actors, the people who were committing the damage out there, have been either captured or killed. There is still an open question as to exactly what happened in this investigation, and there are enormous investigative resources being poured into that right now,\u201d said Davis.Experienced investigators say the authorities in Boston will try to learn all they can from Tsarnaev through a variety of techniques.Vernon Herron is a retired major from the Maryland State Police, now with the Center for Health and Homeland Security at the University of Maryland.\u201cEverybody has certain triggers that will prompt them to give you information or not give you information,\" he said. \"I have always found it easier to get information from suspects when you didn\u2019t go in heavy-handed and when you spoke with them in a calm voice and tried to build a relationship with them long before you started asking them incriminating questions.\u201dBostonians took part in a moment of silence Monday to mark the one-week anniversary of the bombing attacks that killed three and wounded more than 180 others.Mourning and Recovery After the Boston Attacks", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges <extra_id_0> Defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Prosecutor U.S. <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charge  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wound <extra_id_0> Victim He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> BodyPart throat <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convict <extra_id_0> Defendant terrorists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim three <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

It was just completely flattened,\" she said.\"People just came from everywhere. They were on their hands and knees. They were passing the rubble one by one. They were in a big line.\"You heard them shouting: 'There's one, there's one'.\"It was just total chaos. Soldiers threw their guns down on the ground to help the people from the New Lodge Road dig.\"Later, she went home and found her grandmother in the house crying, after learning that Pat's mother and father had been caught up in the bomb.Her father was seriously injured in the blast.\"After that was like a total blur, because people were coming in and out of the house,\" she said.\"There were that many different stories being told.\"My granny gave me and my brother wee jobs to do about the house.

'It's all right Johnny,' she said. 'It's all right'.\"This seemed to go on every night, where he cried and he relived the whole explosion. It was a very sad time.\"Some reports at the time suggested the bar was frequented by political activists, that the bomb belonged to an IRA team in transit and was a republican 'own-goal'.But this was rubbished as \"ridiculous\" by local residents.Pat said: \"You were saying to yourself: 'Who killed my mummy? Why did my own people kill my mummy?\"At the back of your mind you knew it wasn't our own people that had done it.\"This was a family-run bar and it was people like my mummy and daddy that went to talk with each other and just pass the time of day for a pint or an orange and then come home again.\"Seven years after the bomb, a UVF man received 15 life sentences after he was convicted of the bombing.On Tuesday night a number of events are being held to mark the 30th anniverary of the atrocity.1900 GMT Mass at St Patrick's Chapel, Donegall Street.

{"text": "How Many US Troops Were Killed By Iranian IEDs in Iraq?Far fewer than Congress thinks, according to newly declassified documents from U.S. Central Command.Explosively formed penetrators \u2014 a particularly deadly form of roadside bomb \u2014 killed 196 American soldiers in Iraq over a five-and-a-half-year period, according to recently declassified Pentagon documents.That\u2019s about half as many deaths as lawmakers have attributed to the bombs, which U.S. officials say were largely supplied by Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force.The carnage wrought by EFPs returned to the news over the summer, as opponents of the nuclear deal with Iran cited Tehran\u2019s behind-the-scenes actions against U.S. troops during Operation Iraqi Freedom as a reason to scuttle the agreement.Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who is also running for president, and others in Congress have said that EFPs had killed more than 500 troops.\u201cI understand that the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency has a classified list of roughly 500 American soldiers who were murdered by Iranian IEDs,\u201d Cruz said at a July 29 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.But data from U.S. Central Command, which runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East, suggests the actual toll is far less.According to the first comprehensive accounting, between November 2005 and December 2011, 1,526 EFPs killed a total of 196 U.S. troops and injured 861.Between October 2006 and September 2007, EFPs killed 97 U.S. troops and wounded more than 300 soldiers.EFP attacks peaked in March, April and May 2008, near the end of the American troop surge, when 200 of the bombs were detonated.The deadliest month was April 2008, when EFPs killed 15 U.S. soldiers.The Pentagon attributes the presence of EFPs in Iraq to the Quds Force, the special forces arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard led by Qasem Soleimani.Various EFP \u201cfactories\u201d were found throughout Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.Still, the exact degree to which Iran bears culpability for arming Shia militias in Iraq with EFPs and related equipment is a matter of some dispute.\u201cWe weren\u2019t always able to attribute the casualties that we had to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we didn't necessarily have the forensics to support that,\u201d Gen. Joseph Dunford, the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at his July 9 confirmation hearing.During the hearing, Dunford said the numbers of American soldiers killed by Iran \u201chas been recently quoted as about 500.\u201dCENTCOM later clarified that Dunford was referring to total American deaths by EFPs and other Iranian weapons.It is \u201cimportant to understand that the CENTCOM statistics on EFP detonations are a subset of all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during OIF,\u201d Maj. Genieve David, a CENTCOM spokeswoman, said in an email.Data about the roughly 300 deaths not caused by EFPs, including the kind of weapons used in the attacks, is classified, David said.A few weeks later, at the July 29 hearing, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the outgoing Joint Chiefs chairman, said \u201cseveral hundred\u201d American forces were killed by EFPs.Phil Novack, a spokesman for Cruz, told Defense One that the Senator's office is working with the Pentagon to get specific numbers.He said Cruz used the 500 number based on Dunford's testimony.Cruz \u201casked Secretary Carter to inform the families of the 500 service members who were killed by Iranian EFPs that their loved ones were murdered by the same man who will now receive sanctions relief,\u201d Novack said in an email.\u201cWhether the number is 500 lives or 196 is immaterial; the fact remains that General Soleimani \u2014 a man responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American service members \u2014 will receive sanctions relief to the tune of millions of dollars if this deal is approved.\"The arrival of EFPs on the Iraqi battlefield around 2005 came as a shock to U.S. planners.Along with more run-of-the-mill improvised explosive devices, the deadly bombs drove a crash effort to create and deploy vehicles with far better armor.Whereas most roadside bombs send energy and shrapnel in all directions, EFPs work more like cannons.The force of the blast molds a concave metal disc, called a liner, into a \u201cformed penetrator\u201d which is propelled at up to 3,000 meters per second.The effect is incredibly destructive, even to up-armored Humvees.\u201cYou can do as much or more damage with a 5-pound EFP, which is aimed, as with a 200-pound conventional IED,\u201d a Pentagon analyst told Los Angeles Times writer Andrew Cockburn in 2007.The analyst speculated that the cost to construct such a device was about $30 or less.They\u2019ve been around since at least World War II, when resistance elements in Europe used them against Germans, Cockburn wrote.Among the other Iranian arms introduced to the Iraqi battlefield is the improvised rocket assisted munition, described in one Joint IED Defeat Organization document as \u201ca rocket-fired improvised explosive device made from a large metal canister \u2014 such as a propane gas tank \u2014 filled with explosives, scrap metal and ball bearings and propelled by rockets.\u201dFirst seen in Iraq in 2007, the IRAM \u2014 \u201cessentially an airborne version of a roadside bomb \u2014 a flying IED\u201d is \u201dthe signature weapon used by Iranian-backed militias that operate with the aid of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Group,\u201d the undated document says.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die Killed <extra_id_0> Victim Troops

Both wore blue jeans and dark hoodies, and had covered their faces.The motive for the attack is unknown.Sergeant Matt Bertram told the Associated Press the two men just \"dropped off this device, and took off right away\".\"We have no indication to call it a hate crime or any kind of terrorism act,\" he added.Canadian broadcaster CBC reported a heavy police presence, complete with \"tactical teams\" - and said an officer on the scene could not say whether there was a further threat to public safety.One eyewitness speaking to CBC said he was at a different restaurant nearby when the explosion happened. He suggested that a birthday party, possibly involving children, was taking place inside Bombay Bhel at the time of the blast.Meanwhile, Indian foreign minister Sushma Swaraj said she was in touch with the country's representatives in Canada following the attack on an Indian restaurant, promising \"our missions will work round the clock\".Mississauga, a large city on the shore of Lake Ontario, borders the larger city of Toronto and is home to Toronto Pearson International Airport.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Transportation cordoned <extra_id_0> Destination plaza <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Intervention helped <extra_id_0> Treater paramedics <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Patient injured <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target restaurant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Mississauga <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> Attacker suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target restaurant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Ontario <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place restaurant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place where <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "The Minister of Health, Nancy Perez, spoke today on the status of two diseases currently affecting Venezuelans: chikungunya and dengue fever. Perez confirmed that so far in 2014, there have been 398 cases of chikungunya and 45,745 cases of dengue fever in the country.Both diseases are mosquito-borne. The mortality rate for dengue fever ranges between 1-5%. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the mortality for chikungunya during an outbreak in Africa in 2005-2006 was nearly 0%.Perez conceded that the country is experiencing a shortage of acetaminophen, a medicine used as a pain killer and fever reducer used to combat the symptoms of the diseases. However, Perez assured, the government is doing all it can to resolve the shortage.Doctors Want Emergency DeclaredThe head of the infectious diseases department at the Hospital Universitario de Caracas, Maria Eugenia Landaeta, called on the government today to declare the chikungunya outbreak an emergency. Landaeta said:It\u2019s the first thing you should do because that allows for planification and for the allocation of resources to attack the virus.Landaeta also speculated that the nine unexplained deaths over the last week in Aragua might have been the result of complications from the disease. She said:What we\u2019re thinking, based on the symptoms, is that it could be an instance of complicated cases of chikungunya.She also dismissed the rumours that the disease might be ebola, saying that as far as she was aware none of the victims had any contact whatsoever with anyone from Africa. Landaeta also called on Venezuelans to think critically, and to not fall into a \u201ccollective panic\u201d regarding these diseases.Alleged Ongoing Confrontation Leaves Students InjuredAn alleged ongoing confrontation in or around the Universidad de Los Andes campus in Tachira state between students and security forces has left at least one student injured.

{"text": "Boston Bomb Suspect Sent to Federal Medical DetentionBoston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been moved to a prison medical facility as authorities continue to search for answers about the attack.The U.S. Marshals Service said Friday that Tsarnaev was moved to the Federal Medical Center Devens, a Bureau of Prisons facility in the northeastern state of Massachusetts. He was transferred there from a Boston hospital where he had been receiving treatment for injuries sustained during his capture last week.Federal Medical Center Devens, Ayer, MassachusettsA spokesman did not give details about the condition of the 19-year-old, who officials say is recovering from a neck wound.Tsarnaev's brother and alleged co-conspirator, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died in a confrontation with police last week.Also Friday, FBI agents searched a landfill near the campus of the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student. Officials did not say what investigators were looking for.In Washington, lawmakers said that authorities are trying to determine whether or not the brothers' mother was involved in the radicalization of her two sons. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Dutch Ruppersberger, said she is a \"person of interest.\"The Associated Press reported Friday that the bombing suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, had been added to a federal terrorism database about 18 months before the Boston attack.In Russia, Tsarnaeva and her former husband, Anzor, said Thursday their sons did not carry out the Boston attack that killed three people and injured more than 250 others. In a news conference in Makhachkala, the parents said their sons were framed, and the mother accused U.S. authorities of needlessly killing Tamerlan.\"What have you done with my son? He was alive. Why did they need to kill him? Why didn't they send him to, you know, Guantanamo or wherever? Why did they kill him? Why? Why did they have to kill him? They got him alive, right? He was in their hands,'' she said.Tsarnaeva said she would not accept that her sons had planted the bombs.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev faces a charge of using a weapon of mass destruction, which carries a possible death sentence if he is convicted.New York officials say the suspects were devising a plan to attack Times Square as they were running from authorities. New York Police Chief Ray Kelly said Dzhokhar told investigators they planned to drive to New York to set off their remaining explosives.He said the plan fell apart when they realized the vehicle they had hijacked was running low on gas. When they stopped to refuel, the driver of the car escaped, and alerted police to their location.New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the incident shows that New York, which was hit by terrorist attacks in 2001 that killed nearly 3,000 people, remains an inviting target.\"The fact is New York City remains a prime target for those who hate America and want to kill Americans,\" said Bloomberg.U.S. officials are continuing to examine whether the Boston Marathon attack could have been prevented, as warning signs emerged that Tamerlan was turning toward extremism.Senator Lindsey Graham said he believes Boston is becoming \"a case study in system failure\" by U.S. intelligence agencies.\u201cWe need to understand that Bin Laden may be dead, but the war against radical Islam is very much alive. Radical Islam is on the march and we need to up our game,\u201d said Graham.Authorities say Tamerlan Tsarnaev was placed on a U.S. counter-terrorism list in late 2011.The officials say the CIA asked that his name be placed on the list after the agency was contacted by the Russian government with its concerns that he had become a radical Islamist.Moscow also issued a similar warning on him to the FBI earlier in 2011. Officials say the agency launched an investigation, but eventually concluded he posed no threat.U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns about information sharing between U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon attack. Authorities will brief the full U.S. Senate on the investigation into the bombing.Several months after he first came to the attention of U.S. federal agents, Tamerlan Tsarnaev left the U.S. in January 2012 for a six-month visit to Russia. U.S. investigators questioned the suspects' parents in the Russian republic of Dagestan to try to determine if Tamerlan had contacts with Islamic extremists. The family is originally from Chechnya, where Muslim insurgents have for decades been engaged in a bloody conflict with Russia.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Transportation Sent <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination Federal Medical Detention <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation moved <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination prison medical facility <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation moved <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination Federal Medical Center Devens <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation transferred <extra_id_0> Destination there <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin hospital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Intervention treatment <extra_id_0> Patient he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker sons <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer sons <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die injured <extra_id_0> Victim others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer sons <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Victim him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Killer they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Killer him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charge <extra_id_0> Defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target Times Square <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer terrorist <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact contacted <extra_id_0> Participant government <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack conflict <extra_id_0> Attacker insurgents <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Russia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection searched <extra_id_0> Observer agents <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity landfill <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place campus <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Associated Press <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Defendant mother <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim Bin Laden <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection investigation <extra_id_0> Observer Senate <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator Lindsey Graham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator Bloomberg <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator Ray Kelly <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant investigators <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator she <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Boston Marathon Bomber Caught, Town Celebrates\u201cWe got him!\u201d That was heard on the streets of Boston Friday night as police captured the second suspect in the Boston marathon bombings. The mayor was heard congratulating police over their two-way radios. And the tension that gripped Boston since Monday's blasts changed to celebration.Jubilation erupted in the streets of Watertown, Massachusetts.For every police vehicle, there was drive-by congratulations after nearly 24 hours of gunshots, explosions and lockdowns.Suspect number 2 in the marathon bombings rode inside this ambulance, injured, on the way to the hospital and jail.\u201cWhen I saw the guy's face in the ambulance, I thought, 'They got him alive.' That's really important,\u201d said Anthony Pelton, a Watertown taxidriver.Police found 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev inside a boat in the backyard of a house, not too far from where he lived.Bryan Kennedy, a Watertown resident, heard the final gunshots when he was walking nearby.\"It rattles you. It definitely makes you put your head on a swivel and look around and see everything around you,\" he said.Suspect number 1, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed during a gunbattle with police Thursday night in the same town. But the younger Tsarnaev escaped. Thousands of police began a massive manhunt, blocking streets in the neighborhood and ordering residents to stay in their homes.The two brothers are ethnic Chechens who have lived legally in the United States for about 10 years. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, two years ago a foreign government requested information on Tamerlan Tsarnaev based on information he was a follower of radical Islam. The FBI found no evidence of terrorist activity at that time.\u201cWhatever they thought they could ultimately achieve, they've already failed,\" said President Obama spoke from the White House, after a long day monitoring developments in Boston.The capture brings to an end five unsettling days since the double bombing at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. Three people were killed and more than 170 injured.\"It's been a rough week. What happened on Monday is going to change that day forever for all of us,\" said Watertown resident Amy Wrynn.Police say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was on a cell phone during the first bombing. Then he left a backpack at the site of the second bombing, which occurred just seconds later. He is seen on this surveillance video walking through the crowds behind his brother.

{"text": "DENVER (AP) _ Jurors on Friday saw McDonald\u2019s security pictures of Timothy McVeigh holding a fruit pie and checking his watch just before he allegedly walked to a body shop and rented the truck used in the Oklahoma City bombing.A courtroom monitor flashed the jerky, stop-action black-and-white pictures of the lanky McVeigh walking through the McDonald\u2019s straight at the camera, an image that caused some bombing survivors and relatives to flinch.The pictures _ taken two days before the bombing _ set the stage for one of the most important prosecution witnesses: Eldon Elliott, the body shop owner who has identified McVeigh as the man who rented the Ryder truck.ADVERTISEMENTProsecutors built up to Elliott\u2019s testimony by meticulously constructing a time line of McVeigh\u2019s movements in the critical days before the bombing, using everything from the security camera to a Chinese take-out order.A cab company official testified one of her cars had transported someone from the Junction City motel where McVeigh was staying to the McDonald\u2019s. Prosecutors say McVeigh took a cab because his car was parked near the federal building in Oklahoma City, waiting to serve as his getaway.David D\u2019Albini, who was manager of the McDonald\u2019s at the time, identified still pictures from the tape as McVeigh at the counter buying a fruit pie and later walking through the dining area.``It\u2019s him, isn\u2019t it, there\u2019s no doubt in your mind?\u2033 McVeigh attorney Stephen Jones asked.``Yes,\u2033 D\u2019Albini replied.Prosecutors say McVeigh spent eight minutes in the restaurant and then made a 15-minute walk to Elliott\u2019s Body Shop to rent the truck that exploded April 19, 1995, outside an Oklahoma City federal building, killing 168 people.Authorities traced the bomb-carrying truck to Elliott\u2019s through a vehicle identification number on a truck axle found in the bombing debris. The truck matching that number was rented April 17, 1995, at Elliott\u2019s by a man using the name Robert Kling.Earlier Friday, prosecutors called a Chinese restaurant owner to link McVeigh to the Kling name.Yuhua Bai, the owner of the Hunan Palace in Junction City, testified that a food order was sent to the Dreamland Motel room where McVeigh stayed the week before the bombing and the name given was Robert Kling.Bai said she took the phone order for moo goo gai pan and egg rolls from a man using the name Kling on April 15, 1995, four days before the bombing. Bai, a Chinese immigrant, recalled commenting to the man about his last name.She said it sounded ``like a Chinese name.\u2033Under cross-examination, Ms. Bai admitted she did not know who ordered the food or took delivery. She said the delivery man did not get a good look at the man.Later, Marife Nicholas, the wife of McVeigh\u2019s alleged conspirator Terry Nichols, testified her husband got a telephone call during Easter dinner, three days before the blast, and left the house abruptly, returning the following day.During that time, prosecutors allege Nichols drove to Oklahoma City to pick up McVeigh, who had stashed a getaway car near the bombing site.McVeigh, a 29-year-old Gulf War veteran, could get the death penalty if convicted of murder and conspiracy in the bombing, the deadliest act of terrorism on U.S. soil. Nichols is to be tried later.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Boston Bomber Sentenced to DeathConvicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been sentenced to death over the April 2013 attack that killed three people and wounded 264 others.A Boston jury, consisting of seven men and five women, reached the decision Friday in the penalty phase of the trial after deliberating for more than 14 hours over three days. The jury unanimously determined that, based on the \"aggravating and mitigating circumstances,\" Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death.Karen Snyder, right, and Kathryn Vanwie react to the announcement of the death penalty verdict for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev outside the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in Boston, May 15, 2015.Unanimous decisionThe jury had to reach a unanimous decision for Tsarnaev to receive the death penatly. Otherwise, he would have spent the rest of his life in prison without parole.VOA's Fatima Tlisova reported from the courtroom that some of the jurors were crying as Tsarnaev sat with his head down.In a statement following the verdict, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch accused Tsarnaev of \"coldly and callously\" perpetrating a terrorist attack. She said no verdict can \"heal the souls of those who lost loved ones, nor the minds and bodies of those who suffered life-changing injuries.\"But she said the death penalty is a \"fitting punishment for this horrific crime\" and said she hoped the case's completion brings closure to the victims and their families.U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, who prosecuted the case, said at a news conference that the verdict was \"fair and just.\" She said Tsarnaev believed in an ideology of hate and expressed that ideology by killing and maiming Americans, noting that he will \"pay with his life.\"Vincent Lisi, the FBI special agent in charge of the case, said the bombing victims motivated and inspired the investigators every day.Tsarnaev, 21, was found guilty last month of all 30 terrorism and other charges. Of those, 17 carried the possibility of the death penalty.Jurors' deliberationsJurors were required to fill out a lengthy, complicated verdict form that asked them to make findings on 12 aggravating factors prosecutors said support a death sentence and 21 mitigating factors Tsarnaev's lawyers said instead support a sentence of life in prison.The jurors then had to weigh any mitigating factors against any aggravating ones to determine Tsarnaev's sentence.During the penalty phase of the judicial proceedings, prosecutors brushed off defense arguments that Tsarnaev was under the strong influence of his older, radicalized brother, Tamerlan, who was killed in a police shootout.They said even though he was only 19 at the time of the marathon bombing, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was old enough to know right from wrong, and he wanted to avenge U.S. wars in Iran and Afghanistan.The Boston Marathon bombing was one of the bloodiest terrorist attacks in the United States since September 11, 2001.Two pressure-cooker bombs packed with shrapnel exploded near the marathon finish line on April 15, 2013. The Tsarnaev brothers also killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer days later.Mike Eckel and Mike Richman contributed to this report from Washington.

Well, here it is in black and white. It\u2019s an admission. They have got to do something with this information.\u201dThe Birmingham pub bombings - The 28 numbers that add up to a cover-up, say campaignersMr Conway, now a criminal lawyer in Dublin, says in the book that where off-duty soldiers were the targets of bombings \u201cI had little sympathy for either the soldiers or the unfortunate civilians who had been sharing their drinking space.\u201dHe continued: \u201cThe Birmingham bombs were another matter.\"The bombings came after British police disrupted funeral arrangements for James McDade, a volunteer who had himself died in a premature explosion in England.\u201cTempers were high and I, for one, certainly at first feared that the local IRA had knowingly caused these dreadful casualties \u2013 21 people were killed and a great many others injured.\u201d\u201cI was appalled and personally ashamed of the bombing, which went against everything we claimed to stand for.\u201dHe said he told two other senior IRA figures, Dave O\u2019Connell and Kevin Mallon \u201cexactly what I thought\u201d when they met up.\u201cIn fact, both men were themselves furious, fully recognising not just the damage the bombing had caused to the IRA but its immorality as well.\u201dMcDade, a lieutenant in the Birmingham Brigade of the IRA, blew himself up while trying to plant a bomb at Coventry Telephone exchange a week before the pub bombings.Neither The Mulberry Bush nor The Tavern in The Town had any military connection.Normal IRA procedure at the time for any attack on non-military targets was to give a 30-minute warning in order for full evacuations to take place.Read our docudrama minute-by-minute recreation of the events of November 21 1974The Birmingham Mail received an ambiguous call at 8.11pm on November 21. The caller did not identify either pub, referring instead to The Rotunda, above The Mulberry Bush and the New Street Tax Office, which was above the underground Tavern in The Town.The first bomb destroyed The Mulberry Bush just six minutes later. The Tavern was destroyed at 8.27pm.Conway was not directly involved in the debrief with the England Operational Commander.But he said he was later told \u201cthat the early indications were that the casualties were the result of yet another failure in the warning system, a succession of phone boxes from which the warning might have been relayed having proved to be inoperable.\u201dIn an interview with a national newspaper he described the Birmingham pub bombings as \u201ca total disaster.\u201dHe added that the secret \u2018Feakle Talks\u2019, held a couple of weeks after the bombings, were used by the IRA to try to start to repair its image after the Birmingham and the Guildford pub bombings.The talks, in Feakle, County Clare, involved senior IRA officials and Protestant clergymen and ended abruptly after a tip-off that Irish Special Branch officers were on their way to arrest the republicans.But they set in train a process that eventually led to a brief ceasefire that began on December 22, 1974.Conway had been recruited in 1970, having been radicalised during the 1968 student protest movements.He met with senior republicans, including future deputy first minister of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness and Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams.Adams continues to deny that he was ever in the IRA.Conway was later jailed in Belfast\u2019s notorious Crumlin Road prison and went on hunger strike to achieve political status.Although he left the IRA in 1975, he rejoined during the 1981 hunger strike, then finally broke with the republican movement for good in 1993 when the British and Irish governments announced the Downing Street Declaration.He claimed the declaration basically reinforced partition.\u201cThe IRA went on ceasefire, it decommissioned and did all the things they said they would never do, and disappeared into history,\u201d he said.\u201cIt was a complete and utter defeat, absolutely.\u201dIn his book he also claims that rogue Irish police officers colluded with the IRA throughout the Troubles and that members of the Dublin establishment, including several mainstream politicians, aided the Provisionals in their armed campaign.* Southside

{"text": "LISTEN TO ARTICLE 5:16 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post EmailThis past April, a number of Venezuelan military dissidents were holed up in neighboring Colombia plotting to overthrow the government of President Nicolas Maduro when they were approached by a group with similar plans.The second group, mostly civilians, wanted to assassinate Maduro and suggested joining forces. They showed videos of armed drones shipped from Miami and being tested on a Colombian farm.Maduro attends a ceremony prior to explosion on Aug. 4. Photographer: Juan Barreto/AFP via Getty ImagesThe military dissidents declined to participate. They found the civilians unprofessional and weren\u2019t interested in killing Maduro. Their goal was to capture him and put him on trial.Two weeks ago, when Maduro was speaking at a military parade in Caracas, drones packed with plastic explosives detonated nearby in a failed assassination attempt. A participant in the April Bogota meeting said in an interview that he believes the people his group met with were the perpetrators.InfiltratedHis group, which included members of all four armed-service branches, was later infiltrated by the Venezuelan security services. Several dozen were arrested, breaking up the most serious attempt to overthrow Maduro in his five years in office. The plan was called Operation Constitution. The man remains abroad.His theory about who was behind the drone attack is one of several clues emerging about the perpetrators of the Aug. 4 assault.The government also knows some things about the plotters. It says their financier is Osman Delgado, a Venezuelan living in Miami who is linked to a 2017 attack on a military base. Delgado couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.The government has released audio recordings of what seem to be the attackers on the day of the assassination attempt. The recordings reveal a chaotic group bickering and scolding one another for failing to report in or not speaking loudly enough or announcing that the military ceremony being attacked was underway.Security forces check a building after an explosion during the ceremony on Aug. 4. Photographer: Juan Barreto/AFP via Getty Images\u201cSay Something!\u201dAt one point, one of the alleged conspirators can be heard giving a series of instructions on how to operate the drone. Later, another demands the status of the rest of the group after one drone is airborne. \u201cUpdates please. Say something! Everything is quiet!\u201d she is heard to say.The government appears to be using the plot to pursue political opponents who may have nothing to do with it, an approach it has used in the past. It has at times arrested opponents and accused them of sabotage as the economy and basic services have collapsed. In the past, the plots were mostly invented for political purposes; now they\u2019re increasingly real.In the past two weeks, the government has announced the arrests of two high-ranking national guardsmen, a congressman and almost a dozen other people, many younger than 30.The Venezuelan Justice Organization, a human-rights watchdog, says there are currently about 150 servicemen and women behind bars.Soldiers in T-ShirtsOne group claiming responsibility for this month\u2019s attempt is a network of online activists called Soldados de Franela, or Soldiers in T-Shirts, named after the way street protesters hide their faces. The escaped plotter, however, doesn\u2019t think they are the people he met with in Bogota.What is clear is the depth of despair spreading across Venezuela as it descends into a lawless failed state where crime is rampant, those who can are leaving and hunger gnaws away at many of the nation\u2019s remaining 30 million inhabitants. For at least a year, there have been multiple small-scale rebellions, largely unconnected.Officials say as many 34 people, including opposition leaders and former student protesters, conspired in the drone attack. The president was unharmed, but much of the country watched on live television as hundreds of soldiers scattered following the off-camera explosions, deeply embarrassing the government.Juan Requesens Source: AFP TV/AFP via Getty ImagesAmong the detainees are a general and colonel of the national guard and the congressmen, Juan Requesens. He has been charged with attempted homicide and treason. The government has released a video of Requesens, 29, that shows him apparently answering an interrogator and acknowledging participating in the plot. His party says he was coerced and drugged. Another video his supporters leaked shows him in a state of ruin, almost naked in what appears to be soiled underwear.20 More SuspectsAuthorities are now seeking an additional 20 suspects, including a lawmaker in exile, who are at large across Latin America and in the U.S.The government has named as one of the leaders Julio Borges, the former head of Venezuela\u2019s opposition-led congress, who fled to Colombia earlier this year. Borges has denied involvement and said the attacks were perpetrated from within the government\u2019s own ranks.Soldiers in T-Shirts formed following a wave of anti-government unrest in 2014. Its website and social-media accounts have been popular among demonstrators and resistance groups for updates on protests and news critical of the government.In 2017, Soldiers in T-Shirts began disseminating messages and videos of Oscar Perez, an elite police officer who commandeered a helicopter and called upon Venezuelans to rise up against the government. Security forces killed him in January in an hours-long shootout that was, in part, broadcast across social media.One of the Soldiers in T-Shirts leaders, who gave his name as Gregory, confirmed Perez\u2019s death the day of the raid in an interview with CNN en Espanol. Whatever their role in the most recent attack, he said, the group is growing.\u201cThis is not a defeat,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government wants to view it as a trophy, but there are more of us. We are thousands.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Fabiola Zerpa, and Noris Soto", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime <extra_id_0> Place Venezuela <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shootout  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die death  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact disseminating messages and videos  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assault <extra_id_0> Attacker perpetrators <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> Target Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Several <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack the assassination attempt  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Jailer It <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee opponents <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Defendant them <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Prosecutor It <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain the arrests <extra_id_0> Detainee other people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer the government <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact announced  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact meeting <extra_id_0> Participant participant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain behind bars <extra_id_0> Detainee servicemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate small-scale rebellions  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime attempted homicide  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime treason  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "London has been rocked by a second bomb in a busy market area in a week, injuring five people in the East End.The device exploded in Brick Lane, the centre of one of the capital's biggest Bangladeshi communities and a popular Saturday market. Surrounding buildings and two cars were severely damaged. Local people said rumours of bomb threats had been sweeping the Brick Lane area all week.Police are linking the explosion with last Saturday's bomb in Brixton which injured 39 people. Responsibility for that bomb has been claimed by four racists groups.Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry, head of anti-terrorist branch, said: \"The device has similarities to the device that exploded in Brixton with terrible consequences last Saturday. I am linking the crimes. We are treating this as a racist offence.\"Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking in Washington where he is attending a Nato summit said: \"These things are outrageous and we will not tolerate them and we will make every effort to find out those responsible and bring them to justice.\"A spokesman for The Royal London Hospital at Whitechapel, close to the scene of the explosion, said it had treated five casualties from the blast, two women and three men, all middle-aged.Superintendent David Finnimore said he believed a man was driving the device to Brick Lane police station, a local office closed at weekends, when it went off. Amazingly, the man suffered only slight injuries. The blast destroyed a green Volvo and a maroon Ford Sierra.Police cordoned off the area and evacuated hundreds of people before checking under rows of parked cars in case there were any more devices primed to go off.Louise Allan, 29, of New Zealand, was 20 metres away when the bomb went off. She said: \"We were sitting in Brick Lane and I heard a hollow sound and I said to my friend that it sounded like a bomb. We went down the road and saw smoke. The whole of the road was filled with thick black smoke.\"A Tower Hamlets councillor told how he ran to the scene after hearing the blast. Raja Miah said: \"When I got there it looked like a scene from a war zone. I saw a car ablaze with pieces of shrapnel and debris all over the place. I saw several people with blood from glass injuries on their face.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack rocked <extra_id_0> Place London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target area <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Brick Lane <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle damaged <extra_id_0> Artifact buildings <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Intervention treated <extra_id_0> Patient men <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Treater it <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Whitechapel <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Victim man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle destroyed <extra_id_0> Artifact Ford Sierra <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> BodyPart face <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument glass <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Alan Fry <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Brixton <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Tony Blair <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant spokesman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack went off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice it <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack went off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation evacuated <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transporter Police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime checking <extra_id_0> Investigator Police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant She <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Raja Miah <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Court Convicts Friend of Boston Bombing SuspectA court has convicted a friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzokhar Tsarnaev for impeding the investigation into last year's deadly blast.Azamat Tazhayakov, a foreign student from Kazakhstan, was found guilty of conspiracy and obstruction of justice in Boston.Prosecutors said three days after April 15, 2013, bombing, 20-year-old Tazhayakov and another college friend removed Tzarnaev's backpack from his dormitory room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. The bag contained altered fireworks the friends threw away.Tazhayakov faces up to 20 years in prison for the obstruction of justice charge and a maximum of five years in jail on the conspiracy charge. His sentencing is scheduled for October 16.Twin bombs exploded near the finish line of the annual Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 260 others.Police say that two ethnic Chechen brothers who had lived in the United States for a decade, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, carried the bombs in backpacks to the Boston street near the finish line before detonating them. Days later, Tamerlan was killed in a gun battle with police and Dzhokhar was found hiding in a boat parked in the backyard of a suburban Boston home. Authorities say he left a hand-scrawled confession inside the boat that said the bombings were retaliation for the U.S. killing of Muslims in American-led wars overseas.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, now 20, is in a U.S. prison awaiting trial on multiple charges, including use of a weapon of mass destruction.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack Bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict Convicts <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt Court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant Friend <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant friend <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonating <extra_id_0> Instrument them <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Defense Admits Suspect's Guilt in Boston Marathon BombingThe defense lawyer for suspected Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told the jury at his trial Wednesday that he helped carry out the deadly 2013 attack, but contended that Tsarnaev's older brother was the mastermind behind the plot.\"It was him,\" attorney Judy Clarke said of her client, who is facing the death penalty if convicted of setting off a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs, packed with nails and ball bearings, at the finish line of the annual race in 2013 that killed three people and injured another 264.Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to the 30 counts against him, including the fatal shooting of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer days after the bombings as the Tsarnaevs tried to flee.Clarke, one of the U.S.'s foremost death penalty legal specialists, told jurors on the first day of the trial the defense will not \"sidestep\" Tsarnaev's guilt.Influence of older brotherBut she claimed that he was deeply influenced by his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, to carry out the attack, which a prosecutor alleged was aimed at avenging U.S. wars in Muslim countries.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev inadvertently killed his brother, running over him with a car, as they attempted to elude police days after authorities had identified them as suspects in the bombings.In this courtroom sketch, defense attorney Judy Clarke is depicted delivering opening statements in front of U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr., on the first day of the federal death penalty trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, March 4, 2015, in Boston.\"It was Tamerlan Tsarnaev who self-radicalized,\" Clarke said. \"It was Dzhokhar who followed him. The evidence will show that Tamerlan planned and orchestrated and enlisted his brother into this series of horrific acts.\"In blaming the older brother, Clarke's strategy appeared aimed at sparing the 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev from the death penalty. If Tsarnaev is convicted, the jury will decide whether he is executed or gets life in prison without the possibility of parole.The approach set up an immediate conflict with U.S. District Judge George O'Toole, who had ruled that the question of the relative culpability of the two brothers was best left to the trial's second phase, once Dzhokhar's guilt has been established.\u201cSome evidence of the brother's interactions will be inevitable,\u201d O'Toole allowed in brief remarks before the trial opened. But he interrupted Clarke multiple times to warn her against going too deep into family history.Defense lawyers had fought up to the last minute to have the trial moved out of Massachusetts, arguing the emotional impact of the bombings ran too deep and too many people had personal connections to the case. Their requests were rejected by O'Toole and a federal appeals court.Prosecutors lay out caseIn his opening statement, U.S. prosecutor William Weinreb accused the younger Tsarnaev of detonating bombs designed to \"tear people apart and create a bloody spectacle.\"Weinreb described the two homemade pressure cooker bombs used in the attack as the type \"favored by terrorists\" because of the mayhem and injuries they could cause. After the blasts, he said, \"The air was filled with the smell of burning sulfur and people's screams.\"Watch video from VOA's Carolyn Presutti:Video sizewidthxheightpixelsDefense Concedes Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Carried Out Boston Marathon BombingsShare this video0:02:20\u25b60:00:00/0:02:20\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 5.6MB360p | 7.7MB720p | 51.3MBThe prosecutor said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev \"believed that he was a soldier in a holy war against Americans.\" Weinreb said Tsarnaev \"also believed that by winning that victory, he had taken a step toward reaching paradise. That was his motive for committing these crimes.\"The shaggy-haired Tsarnaev stared straight ahead, avoiding looking at the jury, as the prosecutor spoke.Victims at trialMore than 20 victims of the blasts watched the early moments of the trial, taking up the entire left-hand side of the courtroom.Two dramatically different portraits of the former college student are expected to emerge during the trial.Was he a submissive, adoring younger brother who only followed directions given by his older, radicalized brother? Or was he a willing, active participant in the attacks?The brothers are ethnic Chechens who had lived in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and the volatile Dagestan region of Russia before coming to the U.S. with their parents and two sisters about a decade before the bombings.Some material for this report came from Reuters and AP.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack Bombing <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize suspected <extra_id_0> IdentifiedRole bomber <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 264 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shooting <extra_id_0> Target officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer brother <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize identified <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject them <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Identifier authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifiedRole suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict convicted <extra_id_0> Defendant Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt jury <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ReleaseParole parole <extra_id_0> Defendant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt jury <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain gets life in prison <extra_id_0> Detainee he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Prosecutor William Weinreb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonating <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Instrument they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime mayhem  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack Bombings <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Dzhokhar Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crimes  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blasts  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Blast also injured more than 50 people, but authorities have yet to suggest who was behind the attackThis article is more than 1 year oldThis article is more than 1 year oldTwenty-one people have been killed and dozens more injured in a car bombing at a Colombian police academy in Bogot\u00e1, recalling the high-profile attacks associated with the bloodiest chapters of the country\u2019s guerrilla and drug conflicts.The scene outside the General Santander police academy was chaotic after the mid-morning explosion on Thursday, with ambulances and helicopters rushing to the normally tightly controlled facility.Witnesses said they heard a loud explosion that destroyed windows in adjacent buildings. Pictures on social media showed a charred vehicle surrounded by debris on the academy\u2019s campus.Among the dead were a Panamanian and an Ecuadorian national.Alcald\u00eda de Bogot\u00e1 (@Bogota) #Atenci\u00f3n El alcalde @EnriquePenalosa se encuentra en la Escuela General Santander acompa\u00f1ando a la @PoliciaColombia.En breve entregaremos m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n.#Bogot\u00e1CondenaElTerrorismo pic.twitter.com/HBekT48yYiRafael Trujillo said he was delivering a care package to his son Gerson, who entered the school two days ago, when he was stopped in his tracks by the blast a block away from the school\u2019s heavily fortified entrance.\u201cI\u2019m sad and very worried because I don\u2019t have any information about my son,\u201d said Trujillo, standing outside the facility, where police officers had set up a taped perimeter. \u201cThis reminds me of some very sad days in the past.\u201dPresident Iv\u00e1n Duque, who was visiting a western state, was rushing back to the capital to oversee the police investigation into what he called a \u201cmiserable\u201d attack.\u201cAll of us Colombians reject terrorism and are united in confronting it,\u201d Duque said in a tweet. \u201cWe won\u2019t bend in the face of violence.\u201dInvestigators had identified the car\u2019s driver as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, who was among the dead, said the Colombian attorney general, N\u00e9stor Humberto Mart\u00ednez.He said the vehicle, a gray Nissan Patrol SUV, was carrying 80kg (176lb) of the high explosive pentolite, which has been used in the past by Colombian guerrillas.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack and Mart\u00ednez said investigators were searching for its \u201cintellectual authors\u201d.For decades, residents of Bogot\u00e1 lived in fear of being caught in a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar\u2019s Medell\u00edn drug cartel. But as Colombia\u2019s conflict has wound down, and the nation\u2019s largest rebel group disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Smouldering remains of car bomb are seen in this screengrab outside Bogot\u00e1 police academy.Authorities have yet to suggest who was behind the attack, but attention has focused on leftist rebels from the National Liberation Army, ELN, which has been stepping up attacks on police targets in Colombia amid a standoff with the conservative Duque over how to restart stalled peace talks.Colombian rebels blamed for killing spree 400 miles inside Venezuela Read moreThe group known was long considered a lesser military threat than the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), whose 7,000 guerrilla fighters disarmed as part of a 2016 peace accord. But in the wake of the peace deal, the Cuban-inspired insurgency has been gaining strength, especially along the eastern border with Venezuela, where it has carried out a number of kidnappings and bombings of oil pipelines. That has hardened Duque\u2019s resolve in refusing to resume peace talks that have been stalled since he took office last August.Thursday\u2019s bombing was the deadliest in the capital since an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary\u2019s Movement for the bombing.But it has been more than a decade since a police or military installation in the capital has suffered a major bombing. A blast at a military university in 2006 left almost two dozen people injured.Ariel \u00c1vila, an analyst who tracks violence, said that in the last four years, there have been 28 attacks in the capital with explosives. While the majority has been carried out with low-grade homemade materials and grenades that have damaged property but left no casualties, he said police intelligence and checkpoints surrounding the city need to be reinforced to prevent more attacks.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack Blast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim more <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place academy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place academy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation rushing <extra_id_0> Vehicle ambulances <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination facility <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place buildings <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle destroyed <extra_id_0> Artifact windows <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place buildings <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation delivering <extra_id_0> Transporter he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact package <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation rushing back <extra_id_0> Destination capital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Iv\u00e1n Duque <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize identified <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject driver <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Identifier Investigators <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifiedRole Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation carrying <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact pentolite <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle SUV <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker cartel <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact talks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Killer rebels <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime kidnappings <extra_id_0> Perpetrator it <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Target pipelines <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker it <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact talks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place capital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place mall <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim woman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place mall <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die injured <extra_id_0> Victim 11 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast <extra_id_0> Place university <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Place capital <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle damaged <extra_id_0> Instrument materials <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

and ball bearings, the agency said.-- The second bomb was in a metal container, but it was unclear whether it was in a pressure cooker as well, the FBI said.-- Photos obtained by CNN show the remains of a pressure cooker found at the scene, along with a shredded black backpack and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings.-- They were sent to the FBI's national laboratory in Virginia, where technicians will try to reconstruct the devices.-- In the past, the U.S. government has warned federal agencies that terrorists could turn pressure cookers into bombs by packing them with explosives and shrapnel, and detonating them with blasting caps.-- Authorities sifted through thousands of pieces of evidence and a mass of digital photos and video clips.They have pleaded for the public's help in providing additional leads and images.The casualtiesThe blasts left three people dead.-- Martin Richard , an 8-year-old boy with a gap-tooth grin and bright eyes.He loved to run and play in his yard.-- Krystle Campbell , a 29-year-old freckle-faced woman described as having \"a heart of gold.\"-- The third victim was Lingzu Lu , a graduate student at Boston University, who had moved to the city last fall, making friends and soaking up new experiences.-- Of the approximately 178 people injured, 66 remain in area hospitals, according to the latest CNN tally.Thirteen of those are still in critical condition, hospital officials said.- Martin's mother and sister are among the wounded.His mother underwent surgery for a brain injury, and his 6-year-old sister lost her leg.The injuries-- Doctors say dozens of victims suffered injuries to their legs that involve blood vessels, bone and tissue.-- The bombings resulted in at least 13 amputations and left doctors picking ball bearings out of victims in the emergency room, a terrorism expert briefed on the investigation said.-- Dr. George Velmahos, head of trauma care at Massachusetts General Hospital, said his team found \"numerous\" metal pellets and nails inside patients' bodies.\"There are people who have 10, 20, 30, 40 of them in their body, or more,\" Velmahos said.-- Dr. Ron Walls also said one patient had more than 12 carpenter-type nails.\"There is no question some of these objects were implanted in the device for the purpose of being exploded forward,\" he said.Terror group links-- While the clues moved the investigation forward, it is still unclear whether the attack was an act of domestic or foreign terrorism.-- No connection has been made to any terrorist group or individual.-- President Barack Obama described the bombings as an act of terrorism, but said it is unclear whether they were the work of a group or \"a malevolent individual.\"-- The Pakistani Taliban has said it was not involved in the attack.-- Authorities don't have a sense of what the motive is, an official said.-- The FBI asked the public to report anyone who talked about targeting the marathon or showed interest in explosives.The agency urged anyone who might have heard explosions in remote areas -- possibly by someone testing a bomb -- or seen someone carrying \"an unusually heavy, dark-colored bag\" around the time of the attack to come forward.'Possible' suspectsThree days later, authorities have yet to make an arrest, but have made \"significant progress,\" a law enforcement official said.-- Investigators have pinpointed two men of \"high interest\" as possible suspects after they appeared in images near the finish line moments before the blasts, a law enforcement official said.-- One of the men is seen carrying a black backpack.-- Authorities had not yet named the two, but their photographs have been distributed to law enforcement, a source said.-- Earlier Wednesday, two sources with knowledge of the investigation identified a man as a possible suspect in the attack, but did not name him.-- Seen on a video, the man wore a white baseball cap.One of the sources added that the cap was on backwards and the man was also wearing a light-colored hooded sweatshirt and a black jacket.-- It was not immediately clear if he is one of those alluded to in the photographs distributed to law enforcement officials.-- Investigators are closer to cracking the case \"every hour,\" Massachusetts Gov.Deval Patrick said.He urged patience with the probe to allow investigators space to do their job.-- \"I wish they had nailed the perpetrator within minutes of this catastrophe, but I understand from experience it's going to take some time,\" he said.The Investigation-- Significant progress has been made in the investigation, but there has been no arrest, the FBI told CNN.-- After sources told CNN on Wednesday that an arrest had been made, sources with the Department of Justice and Boston Police Department each said that no arrest had been made.-- A source with Boston law enforcement said, \"We got him,\" but would not clarify whether that meant an identification had been made or an arrest carried out.-- Some federal sources said that it would be going too far to say even that an identification had been made, but several sources in Boston disputed that, saying a clear identification had been made.-- Investigators believe they have identified a suspect in the marathon bombings, a source who has been briefed on the investigation told CNN's John King.The possible breakthrough came from an analysis of video from a Lord and Taylor department store near the site of the second blast, and video from a Boston TV station helped as well, the official said.-- As they scramble to search for suspects, authorities are processing \"the most complex crime scene that we have dealt with in the history of our department,\" said Ed Davis, the Boston police commissioner.-- Forensic specialists and dogs trained to detect explosive devices and their residue were at the scene of the blasts.A command post has been created, with 1,000 officers conducting interviews and gathering details.-- Authorities have received 2,000 tips from around the world, said Richard DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office.\"Someone knows who did this,\" he said.Security elsewhere-- Cities have stepped up security after the attacks, including Washington, New York, Miami, Chicago, Atlanta and Los Angeles.-- British police said they are reviewing the security plan for the London Marathon scheduled for Sunday.The marathon will observe 30 seconds of silence and is urging runners to wear a black ribbon to mark the Boston tragedy.Reaction-- \"Boston is not going to be intimidated by this,\" said Secretary of State John Kerry, a former U.S. senator from Massachusetts.\"But we are going to find out who did this.The police work being done is extraordinary.The FBI is remarkable.There is a great deal of forensic evidence.We are hopeful we can bring people to justice.\"\"The Islamic Republic condemns killing of innocent people in U.S. Boston, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria in equal measure,\" Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Wednesday, according to a report on state-run Press TV.Tributes-- Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will travel to Boston on Thursday for an 11 a.m. interfaith service dedicated to the victims.The president is expected to meet with the families of those wounded or killed.--Obama declared an emergency in Massachusetts and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1>

school last year to serve four years of \"intensely supervised\" probation Wednesday.Martin Farnsworth appears in 5th District Court via video conference for his initial appearance, St.George, Utah, July 31, 2018 | File photo via court pool, St.George NewsMartin Farnsworth, 17, appeared in 5thDistrict Court Wednesday afternoon where Judge Michael Westfall sentenced him to serve 48 months of supervised probation and 250 hours of community service, along with additional restrictions.Farnsworth had been facing a potential five years-to-life prison term that came with the first-degree felony charge of attempting to injure others with an incendiary device that he pleaded guilty to last month as a part of a plea deal.Prior to taking the plea, Farnsworth faced felony charges for attempted murder and possession of a weapon of mass destruction.The case was originally set in juvenile court last year but was moved to 5th District Court where he was tried as an adult due to the severity of the incident involved.Read more: Judge: 16-year-old who brought bomb to Pine View High School will be tried as adultThe charges stem from a March 5, 2018 incident in which Farnsworth took a homemade explosive to Pine View High School.He placed the would-be incendiary device in a backpack in the cafeteria area during lunch and left after lighting a fuse.At the time, the cafeteria contained between 75-150 students.Pine View High School students are evacuated to the football field as police investigate a bomb scare inside the school and swept the parking lot as a precaution, St.George, Utah, March 5, 2018 | File photo by Mori Kessler, St.George NewsStudents noticed smoke coming from the backpack that contained the device and reported it to school faculty and the school\u2019s resource officer, triggering an evacuation of the school and a multi-agency response from law enforcement.While the incendiary device\u2019s fuse fizzled out and failed to ignite, investigators determined that if it had gone off, it would have caused damage to the immediate area and injured those near it.The device was constructed out of a \"metal soup can filled with metal BB shots removed from shot gun shells,\" according to court documents.It also included \"three canning lids with masking tape, BBs, an improvised fuse, black gun powder, white plastic cup, empty box of box-strike matches, three 16.9 oz.water bottles of gasoline\" and other items.Investigators found that Farnsworth learned to make an incendiary device via online instructions believed to be connected to the Islamic State terror group, according to court records and testimony.Public defender Edward Flint said he was pleased with the sentence in the Martin Farnsworth case, as getting his client released from further incarceration and placed on probation was a primary goal, St.George, Utah, April 24, 2019 | Photo by court pool, St.George NewsEdward Flint, Farnsworth\u2019s attorney, said that building the incendiary device and attempting to use it were a response to bullying his client had received at school and he finally snapped.The result was a criminal act, he added.\"The way life is going, it\u2019s not going well,\" Farnsworth said in a recording of a police interview after he was taken into custody.\"There\u2019s a bunch of bad people.I don\u2019t like the way the world is going.I just wanted to do something to make it different.\"Read more: \u2018If someone got hurt, I probably wouldn\u2019t care\u2019; Teen charged with attempted murder in Pine View High bomb scare\"He feels guilt and remorse, yes, but differently,\" Flint said, referring to Farnsworth being diagnosed with a mild, yet high-functioning form of autism and severe depression.The diagnosis was made by a mental health expert as a part of an evaluation connected to the pre-sentencing report.Read more: Defense in Pine View bombing case says Washington County School District failed teenFlint said the severe depression was a result of the bullying.The perceived lack of empathy on Farnsworth\u2019s part over what he\u2019d done was also a sign of autism spectrum disorder, and not necessary a sign the teen didn\u2019t regret was he had done.\"He\u2019s a model citizen and a good person all around \u2013 but he snapped,\" Flint said.Deputy Washington County Attorney Angela Adams addresses the court in regard to the sentencing of Martin Farnsworth, St.George, Utah, April 24, 2019 | Photo by Court Pool, St.George NewsWestfall did not agree with Flint\u2019s assessment.Being bullied to the point where you hit the bully is snapping, he said.In contrast, Farnsworth\u2019s action were planned out.\"This took some planning.This took some thought, and that\u2019s troubling to me, because you didn\u2019t just \u2018snap.\u2019\"Westfall also addressed Farnsworth prior to sentencing, mentioning that one of the teen\u2019s siblings had written a letter to the court saying the event didn\u2019t define who their brother was.\"Unfortunately, there are things we do that define us,\" Westfall said.\"Had this incendiary device gone off and someone had been hurt, not only would you be defined by this behavior, but so would your family.\"In addition to the 48 months of probation and 250 hours community service, Westfall ordered Farnsworth to wear an ankle monitor for 90 days, have no access to bomb-making materials, seek a psychiatric evaluation for the purpose of getting needed medications, have no internet access for six months, observe a curfew and write an apology letter to Pine View High and its students.Following the sentencing, Deputy Washington County Attorney Angela Adams, who prosecuted the case, said the state was satisfied with the outcome.5th District Judge Michael Westfall listens to the defense for Martin Farnsworth prior to handing down a sentence of 48 months\u2019 probation, St.George, Utah, April 24, 2019 | Photo by Court Pool, St.George News\"He\u2019s getting 48 months of intensely supervised probation,\" Adams said, adding that if Farnsworth does something to put his probation in jeopardy, he could still end up facing the five years-to-life sentence suspended by the judge.\"Of course, we hope he will be successful on probation,\" she said.Adams also said she believes justice was served to the extent that the community is being protected and all involved are doing what they can to minimize the possibility of this incident repeating itself.\"The state is satisfied that the safeguards put into place will protect the community.\"The defense was also pleased with the results of the sentencing.\"What we were hoping for was (Farnsworth) being released from custody into probation without any further juvenile or adult incarceration and that\u2019s what we got,\" Flint said.Farnsworth served 415 days in juvenile detention prior to being released Wednesday.As for the additional restrictions, Flint said they were to be expected and not out of the ordinary for a case involving a first-degree felony.When asked about his client\u2019s reaction, Flint said he didn\u2019t have much of one.\"Martin doesn\u2019t react much,\" he said.\"That\u2019s the nature of autism spectrum disorder.He\u2019s very quiet and introverted.\"Farnsworth\u2019s autism was an angle largely ignored by the state, Flint said, which led to him being treated as a common criminal rather than as someone who needed additional consideration.\"Individuals with autism have a difficult time understanding how other people feel, and have a difficult time processing their own feelings when they are bullied or made fun of or even when they interact normally with other people, they\u2019re going to react differently, and it\u2019s like none of that mattered,\" he said.\"He committed a crime, no doubt about that, but it seems like nobody\u2019s noticing that he\u2019s autistic and he needs help.\"Copyright St.George News, SaintGeorgeUtah.com LLC,

{"text": "Multiple outlets, law enforcement officials, and President Obama responded throughout a manic Monday with news that a horrific looking scene made clear in downtown Boston, even as a frenzied search for more potential explosive devices continued and hospitals rushed to help survivors: The crowd at the finish line of the Boston Marathon was bombed twice in what is being described as both a coordinated \"event\" and \"an act of terror\" with more than 140 people brutally injured at eight Boston hospitals and at least three dead, including a young child.Indeed, even as a city and a nation came together amidst the chaotic scene, there was not much good news in Boston this April 15 \u2014 the annual Patriot Day, a Massachusetts festival holiday with schools and offices closed for the marathon and, on this particular day, tragedy in the happiest of places.The FBI has taken over \"a potential terrorist investigation,\" FBI special agent in charge Richard DesLauriers said at a Monday evening press conference.\"There is no suspect\" at the hospital, Boston Police commissioner Ed Davis said at the briefing, despite reports to the contrary \u2014 and speculation that there was still one or multiple persons of interest being questioned at the hospital.When asked if there was a person of interest at the hospital, DeLaurio declined to comment; he also declined to comment on a Wall Street Journal report that there were five additional devices, which was soon clarified to note that \"investigators now doubt the devices were bombs\" \u2014 just one of many conflicting reports citing anonymous law enforcement officials as the investigation began.(And that's not counting the conspiracy theories.)After the death toll had stood at two for much of the day, Davis confirmed at the evening event that \"at least three people have died\" in the marathon bombing.Governor Deval Patrick said \"we are asking that everyone be at a state of heightened vigilance\" as Boston planned to re-open on Tuesday, though he said it \"will not be business as usual.\"Boston police and the FBI were scheduled to hold another news conference at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday morning.At a late afternoon press conference with Patrick, Davis initially reported a third explosion at JFK Library in Boston, which has since been given the all-clear as a separate fire.At a second police briefing, Davis said \"we have no suspect in custody,\" as CNN reported that the FBI had classified the event as a terrorist attack.Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein classified it as a \"terrorist incident\" that \"could be be foreign, could be homegrown.\"At a White House briefing shortly after 6 p.m. Eastern time on a quiet day in Washington, President Obama reiterated that federal and local investigators are still in the investigation phase.He did not use the words \"terror\" or \"terrorist\" or \"attack,\" instead using the words \"unnecessary loss\" \u2014 \"America will say a prayer for Boston tonight,\" he said \u2014 before delivering a more forceful message:We don't yet have all the answers ...We still do not know who did this or why...But make no mistake we will get to the bottom of this.We will find out who did this ... and any responsible groups will feel the full weight of justice.NBC News and others reported that the White House said the bombings would be \"approached as an act of terror.\"Both Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will meet with Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel on Tuesday.As the investigation continues and news reports continue to make sense of the fallout, you can follow the Boston police scanner, the Boston Globe live blog, and the local CBS, ABC, and Fox stations \u2014 as well as some solid Twitter lists.The basic details of the bombings, however, are starting to come into focus.After two explosions hit at around 2:50 p.m. Boston Police would go on to confirm at least three dead \u2014 NBC News cited law enforcement officials as saying one was an eight-year-old child, a report confirmed by the Boston Globe \u2014 and 141 injuries.As for the two bombs that caused the carnage, it appears they were fairly unsophisticated devices, perhaps pipe bombs stuffed with ball bearings, which doctors later reported pulling out of victims' flesh.ABC News reported that the explosions were triggered by remote detonation, but there's still strikingly little known about the other specifics.Meanwhile, there were gruesome images and raw footage from Copley Square area to makeshift tents, from Boston hospitals to Instagram feeds, of lost limbs, hair on fire, children with severe burns, and worse.Scroll down for all the details on the victims, the persons of interest, the moment of horror, and eyewitness accounts.You can follow all of The Atlantic Wire's ongoing Boston Marathon bomb coverage right here \u2014 and our Day Two aftermath updates here.The CasualtiesThe Boston Marathon is tracking runners here, and for those looking for information on loved ones, here are the best ways online.Also, phone numbers: for families of victims, call 617-635-4500; for tips, call 1-800-494-TIPS.The Boston chapter of the American Red Cross said on Monday evening that there was no need for additional blood donations \"at this time\" as their shelves were full.The Red Cross also opened a disaster response center for the recovery effort.Reports of casualties are largely unconfirmed and varying, but here they are, updated in relative real time.In a Monday night press conference, Dr. Peter Fagenholz, a trauma surgeon at Mass.General Hospital, explained that most of the casualties were vascular, bone-related or soft tissue injuries, and that there had been \"several\" amputees.Fagenholz explained that he started his day in surgery at 8 a.m., and after the explosion worked nonstop until the press conference.Other local hospitals \u2014 some of the best in the nation \u2014 are flooded:Injury count as of 745 pm by hospital: Boston Children\u2019s 8; Brigham 27; BMC 23; MGH 22; BI 21; St E's, 15; Tufts 9 \u2014 The Boston Globe (@BostonGlobe) April 16, 2013An update at the official law enforcement press conference Monday night put the casualty count at 141 injured, at least 15 of them critically.CNN reported that at least ten limbs were lost due to the explosions and doctors were picking ball bearings, a common shrapnel generator in pipe bombs, out of victims.The New York Post reported 12 casualties, and is further reporting that authorities say a suspect in detention is a Saudi national\u2014officials have not confirmed this and Boston PD has not confirmed this.CBS News is reporting that Boston PD has video of someone \"bringing multiple backpacks to blast site.\"There are various reports on Twitter of a suspect being detained, but Davis, the police commissioner, maintainted taht \"we have no suspect in custody,\" seeming to cast doubt on reports quoting a federal law enforcement official in the Post and elsewhere.Among the reported 141 injured a nine-year-old girl, a seven-year-old boy, a 12-year-old, and a two-year-old, according to The Boston Globe.Of the three dead, one is reportedly an eight-year-old boy.The \"Person of Interest\"For now, Boston Police say that there are no suspects, but when asked about scattered reports about a person of interest, officials \u2014 including the new FBI investigator \u2014 would not comment, though law enforcement officials maintain, however anonymously, that there are several active leads.Throughout the day and ahead of other media outlets, a law enforcement official kept telling the New York Post about a \"Saudi national\" as a potential suspect or person of interest, leading to many questions as well as similar reports from Fox News.Another report in the Los Angeles Times said one person \u2014 not a \"suspect,\" but apparently a Saudi national \u2014 was being questioned.\"A federal law enforcement officials said authorities were questioning a Saudi national who was taken to a Boston hospital with injuries,\" the report reads.\"The person was not identified as a suspect.\"Later on Monday evening The Globe reported that authorities were \"questioning person of interest in Marathon bombings at Brigham and Women's Hospital\" but did not provide any details about the person's nationality.However, the paper maintains, \"The situation remains fluid and it remains too early to establish the cause and motivation.\"Officials didn't offer much more clarity at the official press conference on Monday night and appear to be approaching the situation with caution.The New York Times reports, \"Although investigators confirmed that they were speaking to a Saudi citizen, several law enforcement officials took pains to note that no one was being held in custody.\"Meanwhile, the FBI is asking for people to send in any info \u2014 photos, video, tips \u2014 or to call 1-800-CALL-FBI with information regarding the explosions.The investigation remains in the early stages, and the public is clearly pouncing on any sign of a lead.Reports of a police search at a Revere, Mass.condo complex between five and six on Monday night lit up Twitter.However, it's unclear if the search was related to a bombing or not.The Other DevicesSoon after the initial explosions, Boston Globe photographer David L. Ryan reported that he heard but did not see a third explosion, and Boston police were scrambling to contain the scene.\"There were two booms heard from near the finish line\" reports the AP.A spokeswoman at the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel, close to the explosion, says that it was around two blocks away, while The Boston Globe said that police were conducting a \"controlled explosion\" on the 600 block of Boylston Street.Over the course of the afternoon and evening, police say they found five additional devices along the marathon route, though a police source later said it was unclear if they were actually bombs.That number does not include numerous reports of suspicious packages around Boston and neighboring cities.The Boston Globe reported another device found near Harvard, and there was a bomb threat phoned in near the Financial District.There were also reports of undetonated devices being found as far away as Newton, though local police have denied those claims.Again, the Journal walked back its initial claim of the five unexploded devices.And then there was the library fire, which had a whole back-and-forth narrative of its own.Here's an updated interactive map of the at times confounding activity, including multiple reported incidents about unconfirmed devices, fires, and all the explosions throughout Monday, both alleged and confirmed, for a sense of scale in downtown Boston and beyond \u2014 even as the day seemed to settle on the two explosions near the finish line:The FBI said on Monday evening that local police and federal agents would sweep the entire length of the course to look for evidence and additional devices.Meanwhile, the Navy has sent an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team to help with the effort.The Pictures and Video of the ExplosionHere are a couple of many images to flow in from social media early on:Explosion at coply twitter.com/Boston_to_a_T/\u2026 \u2014 Boston to a T (@Boston_to_a_T) April 15, 2013And one more:Just heard that bombs went off at #boston marathon finish line twitter.com/chanyasulkit/s\u2026 \u2014 Chris Chanyasulkit (@chanyasulkit) April 15, 2013Here is perhaps the most shocking, dramatic, and up-close video from the bombings, via the Globe:Here is the moment of impact for the first of the two confirmed explosions, by way of Twitter's Vine, right near the sidewalk (scroll down for video of both):We're going to link to these next two shots (WARNING \u2014 they are graphic) since they show the chaos and some of the injuries, and there are a few very graphic images that have been uploaded to Reddit.NECN's Jackie Bruno reports that the injuries there are gruesome:I saw people's legs blown off.Horrific.Two explosions.Runners were coming in and saw unspeakable horror.\u2014 Jackie Bruno (@JackieBrunoNECN) April 15, 2013To be sure, this is a time to be good to each other.Because there are as many unconfirmed reports and speculative ideas (CBS News reported that certain terrorist target areas are being monitored in Boston, and the Secret Service set up a perimeter around the White House) as there are graphic images.There are amputations.Here are some of the first photos to hit the AP wire (WARNING \u2014 it is graphic):This photo from Reuters photographer John Tlumacki quickly became the iconic image of the day:Check out this Tumblr post where you can see Tlumacki taking the photo.And one more from The Boston Globe:boston marathon explosion twitter.com/GlobeDavidLRya\u2026 \u2014 David L. Ryan (@GlobeDavidLRyan) April 15, 2013Here are more photos from The Atlantic's In Focus blog.Here's video of the first explosion:And another close-up video from the explosion:Here's how a marathon runner saw things:And here's another angle with a second explosion in the distance.Here is the photo of Obama on the phone with FBI Director Robert Mueller (official White House photo by Pete Souza):Here is text of President Obama's full remarks at the White House.Adding further heartbreak to utter tragedy, the 26th mile marker in this year's marathon was actually dedicated to the victims of Newtown.The Eyewitness AccountsThe size of the crowd has yielded countless eyewitness accounts of the horrific scene.One of the more powerful ones we've read comes from The New York Times, which spoke to Rhode Island state trooper and former Marine Roupen Bastajian.\"These runners just finished and they don\u2019t have legs now,\" said Bastajian.\"So many of them.There are so many people without legs.It's all blood.There's blood everywhere.You got bones, fragments.It's disgusting.\"Several of those reporting on the explosions were actually runners in the marathon, so there is no shortage of eyewitness accounts.Two worth reading come from The Wall Street Journal reporter Coleen McCain Nelson and Boston Globe photographer John Tlumacki.Our own Richard Lawson, a Boston native, describes what the scene of the end of the marathon is like on a typical year:Marathon Monday is one of Boston's most celebratory days, with schools and offices closed and people lining the streets cheering runners on for essentially all 26.2 miles of a course which works its way further and further into town.By the time the Boston Marathon reaches the final stretch down narrow Boylston Street, it has entered the busy commercial district of Copley Square.The historic Boston Public Library is on the runners' right, ahead of them the open area of Copley Square Park and the famous Trinity Church.And of course the culmination of all that is the final downtown stretch, as spirited and jovial a scene as there is in Boston at any time throughout the year.The crowd on marathon day is dense and varied \u2014 locals and tourists and running enthusiasts from all over show up hours ahead to secure a good view of the finish line.And of course, there are the runners themselves, still streaming across the finish line for hours after the big winners are crowned.\u2014Richard LawsonAs the day wound down and everyone struggled to process what had happened, Astronaut Chris Hadfield sent a sympathetic dispatch from the International Space Station.\"A somber Spring night in Boston,\" he said, including this aerial photo of the city:Closer to home, some folks at MIT paid tribute to the patriotic spirit with an entire building:Stay tuned for the Wire's Day Two live blog and more at our Boston Marathon hub.Want to add to this story?Let us know in comments or send an email to the authors at , aabadsantos at theatlantic dot com or matt dot sullivan at theatlantic dot com.You can share ideas for stories on the Open Wire.Adam Clark EstesAlexander Abad-SantosMatt Sullivan", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombed <extra_id_0> Target Boston Marathon <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator Richard DesLauriers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant terrorist <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Target JFK Library <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator investigators <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact meet <extra_id_0> Participant Chuck Hagel <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim child <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator Richard DesLauriers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact confirmed <extra_id_0> Communicator Davis <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place event <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator Deval Patrick <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Davis <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator Davis <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient CNN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator CNN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient White House <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reporting <extra_id_0> Communicator CBS News <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Boston PD <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic video <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Wealth of Clues Led to Quick Arrest of New York Suspected BomberNEW YORK \u2014\u00a0The man suspected of planting bombs in a New York neighborhood and a New Jersey seaside town may have aimed to inflict carnage incognito, but he didn't succeed for long in concealing his identity.Ahmad Khan Rahami provided investigators with a wealth of clues that led to his arrest about 50 hours after the first explosion, according to three law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation.His fingerprints and DNA were found at the scene of the Manhattan bombing, they said. His uncovered face was clearly captured by surveillance cameras near the spot of the blast.Electronic toll records show a car to which he had access was driven from New Jersey to Manhattan and back to New Jersey the day of the bombing, according to the officials, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss an ongoing case.Those and other clues spurred officials to publicize his name and photo Monday morning, asking for help finding Rahami, 28, a Muslim U.S. citizen born in Afghanistan, who lives with his family in Elizabeth, New Jersey.As the investigation heated up, a bar owner in Linden, New Jersey, reported someone asleep in his doorway. An officer went to investigate and recognized the man as Rahami, police and the mayor said.Rahami pulled a gun and shot the officer \u2014 who was wearing a bulletproof vest \u2014 in the torso, and more officers joined in a running gun battle along the street and brought Rahami down, police Capt. James Sarnicki said. Another police officer was grazed by a bullet.\"A lot of technology involved in this, but a lot of good, old-fashioned police work, too,\" said New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill. He said now, investigators would \"make sure that we get to the bottom of who's involved and why.\"After surgery for a gunshot wound to his leg, Rahami was being held on $5.2 million bail, charged with five counts of attempted murder of police officers. Federal prosecutors said they still were weighing charges over the bombings. Rahami remains hospitalized.Messages left for family members were not immediately returned. It wasn't clear when Rahami would get an attorney.Officials said they have no other suspects at large, but cautioned they are still investigating.The bombing spread fear across the New York area and revived anxiety about homegrown terrorism nationwide.As the East Coast was rattled by the bombings, a man who authorities say referred to Allah wounded nine people in a stabbing rampage at a Minnesota mall Saturday before being shot to death by an off-duty police officer. Authorities are investigating the stabbings as a possible terrorist attack but have not drawn any connection between the bloodshed there and the bombings.William Sweeney Jr., the FBI's assistant director in New York, said there was no indication so far that the bombings were the work of a larger terror cell.Rahami wasn't on any terror or no-fly watch lists, though he had been interviewed for immigration purposes traveling between the U.S. and Afghanistan, one of the law enforcement officials said.Rahami and his family live above their restaurant \u2014 called First American Fried Chicken \u2014 and the family has clashed with the city over closing times and noise complaints, which the Rahamis said in a lawsuit were tinged with anti-Muslim sentiment.The lawsuit was terminated in 2012 because one of Rahami's brothers had pleaded guilty to blocking police from enforcing closing hours at the restaurant.A childhood friend, Flee Jones, said Rahami had become more religious after returning from a trip to Afghanistan several years ago. Still, some of the family restaurant's customers said Rahami was more likely to talk about his interest in cars than to mention faith.\"He's a very friendly guy,\" patron Ryan McCann said. \"That's what's so scary.\"The investigation began when a pipe bomb blew up Saturday morning in Seaside Park, New Jersey, before a charity race to benefit Marines. No one was injured.Then a shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bomb exploded Saturday night in New York's Chelsea section, wounding 29 people, none seriously. An unexploded pressure-cooker bomb was found blocks away.Late Sunday night, five explosive devices were discovered in a trash can at an Elizabeth train station, about 3 miles from where Rahami was later found asleep in the doorway of a bar.Investigators are still gathering evidence and have not publicly tied Rahami to those devices, though Sweeney noted they aren't \"ruling anything out.\"The bombs discovered Saturday all used flip cellphones as a trigger and were all made with easily purchasable materials, a federal law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said.After zeroing in on Rahami and learning of the car that had traveled between New Jersey and New York, authorities pulled it over Sunday night after it headed in the direction of Kennedy airport. The law enforcement officials said at least one of Rahami's relatives was in the car.All five were questioned and released, Sweeney said. He declined to say whether they might later face charges.Around the time Rahami was captured, President Barack Obama was in New York on a previously scheduled visit for a meeting of the U.N. General Assembly. He called on Americans to show the world \"we will never give in to fear.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain Arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee Bomber <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble planting <extra_id_0> Artifact bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place town <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator officials <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Manhattan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation driven <extra_id_0> Vehicle car <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin New Jersey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination New Jersey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigate <extra_id_0> Investigator officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Defendant Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shot <extra_id_0> Attacker Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument gun <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain brought <extra_id_0> Detainee Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer officers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure grazed <extra_id_0> Instrument bullet <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wound <extra_id_0> Victim Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Intervention surgery  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigating  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Injurer Allah <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shot <extra_id_0> Attacker officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Allah <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigating <extra_id_0> Investigator Authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation traveling <extra_id_0> Origin Afghanistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination U.S. <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict pleaded <extra_id_0> Defendant one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation returning <extra_id_0> Destination Afghanistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place New Jersey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die wounding <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation traveled <extra_id_0> Origin New Jersey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination New York <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ReleaseParole released <extra_id_0> Defendant five <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain captured <extra_id_0> Detainee Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was attending a ceremony to celebrate the 81st anniversary of the National Guard in Caracas on August 4, 2018.Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro survived an alleged assassination attempt via drone on Saturday when a flying device carrying explosives detonated during a speech he was delivering in Caracas.Maduro, an unpopular leader who has presided over one of the worst economic collapses in Latin America in recent history, blamed the \"far right,\" including Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, for the attack.Here\u2019s what happened: On Saturday evening, Maduro was addressing the crowd at a military parade celebrating the 81st anniversary of the National Guard when a flying device approached and exploded, according to Venezuelan officials.Footage of the event, which was broadcast on live television, shows Maduro look up mid-speech, while his wife Cilia Flores, who is standing behind him, flinches.For a few seconds, no one appears to react, as they seem to be processing what\u2019s happened.\"Seconds later, there was a second explosion,\" Maduro said in a national address recounting the incident.Then the crowd disperses and people flee.Some images on Twitter capture the chaos and aftermath.Quisieron poner a prueba lealtades-de la Fuerza Armada y del pueblo sobre todo- y ya ven que somos infranqueables a la hora de defender nuestro proceso revolucionario y a nuestro l\u00edder @NicolasMaduro El fascismo No pasar\u00e1.pic.twitter.com/Nsa0fY4fOc\u2014 freddy \u00f1a\u00f1ez (@luchaalmada) August 5, 2018Seven members of the National Guard were harmed in the attack, Information Minister Jorge Rodr\u00edguez said at a press conference after the incident.He added that Maduro was unharmed and in a \"perfect state of health.\"\"This was an attempt to kill me,\" Maduro later said in a retelling of what happened.\"Today they attempted to assassinate me.\"Firefighters at the scene disputed that account, however, telling the Associated Press that a gas tank had exploded nearby.Maduro, 55, said he believed the attempted attack was part of a right-wing plot against him that was working with opponents in Bogot\u00e1 and Miami, including Santos, the outgoing Colombian president.He provided no evidence to back up his accusations.The Colombian government called Maduro\u2019s charges \"absurd.\"Other countries expressed support for Maduro after the attack, including Turkey, Syria, Nicaragua, and Russia.Bolivian President Evo Morales in a series of tweets expressed solidarity with Maduro and described the attempt as a \"crime against humanity.\"A little-known group called Soldiers in T-Shirts claimed responsibility for the act, saying they planned to fly two drones at the president but the devices were shot down.The AP couldn\u2019t verify the claims, and the group didn\u2019t respond to a message from the outlet when it reached out for comment.National Security Adviser John Bolton said in an appearance onFox News Sundaythat the United States had \"no involvement\" in the incident.\"If the government of Venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of US criminal law, we\u2019ll take a serious look at it, but in the meantime I think what we really should focus on is the corruption and oppression in the Maduro regime in Venezuela,\" he said.The political situation in Venezuela is badMaduro, a former bus driver who took over as president after former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez died in 2013, has overseen a catastrophic economic collapse in Venezuela.The socialist economy, once thriving, has spiraled since global oil prices dropped in 2014.Venezuelans suffer from widespread food and medicine shortages, and the majority of the country is living in poverty.Seventy-five percent of the country\u2019s population lost an average of 19 pounds of bodyweight between 2015 and 2016, and the International Monetary Fund expects inflation in Venezuela to reach 13,000 percent in 2018.Thousands of Venezuelans are fleeing the country.Yet Maduro remains in power.He won reelection in May due to a largely rigged election.He banned two of the most popular opposition leaders, Leopoldo Lopez and Henrique Capriles, from running against him, and implied that any Venezuelans who didn\u2019t vote for him could lose government food subsidies.His election is likely to worsen the economic crisis in Venezuela: Instead of electing a reformer who might enact the measures necessary to pull the country out of the state it\u2019s in right now, such as addressing its currency exchange policy and diversifying the economy away from oil dependence, the country now has Maduro for another six years.And he remains defiant \u2014 in the face of opposition, or alleged assassination attempts.Update: Story updated with comments from John Bolton.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument drone

{"text": "Venezuela\u2019s beleaguered government appeared prepared to go ahead with a vote on Sunday that critics at home and abroad have warned will seal the demise of the oil-rich nation\u2019s democracy.At least five people were killed last week after the opposition stepped up its protests against the controversial vote that will elect a 545-member constituent assembly with the power to rewrite the constitution and dissolve state institutions.A government ban on public demonstrations in the run-up to the election reduced turnouts for nationwide protests called by the opposition, but sporadic looting and clashes between protesters manning barricades of tree branches and barbed wire were reported in several cities on Friday night.Q&A Why is there unrest in Venezuela? Show \u2022 At the heart of the crisis is a cratering economy and acute shortages of medicine and food, coupled with rising anger at a soaring crime rate and an increasingly authoritarian government \u2022 The president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, won a general election in 2013 on a platform of continuing his predecessor Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's socialist policies of using the country's oil riches to reduce inequality and lift people out of poverty, but falling oil prices have forced the government to curtail social programmes \u2022 Opposition activists have been staging unrelenting protests against the government.Despite the continuing threat of repression, the opposition coalition, known as MUD, called for mass demonstrations in Caracas on Sunday while voting takes place.\u201cTomorrow we rebel,\u201d tweeted Freddy Guevara, vice-president of the opposition-held national legislature, whose power to legislate was hamstrung by a supreme court decision in April, prompting the protests.At least 113 people have been killed, and more than 2,000 wounded, in constant street protests since April, triggering President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s decision to create the assembly.Maduro has said the assembly will help bring peace to the sharply divided country where, despite its oil wealth, many Venezuelans are going hungry because of food shortages and spiralling inflation. But the opposition said it is little more than a power grab to consolidate the ruling socialist party\u2019s grip. It is boycotting the assembly and demanding general elections instead.\u201cOn 30 July, the constitutional assembly will happen,\u201d Maduro said. \u201cI\u2019ve been loyal to Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s legacy. Now it\u2019s your turn.\u201dAn attempt at brokering an agreement by the former prime minister of Spain, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to avert the increased tensions appeared to have failed. Zapatero issued a statement on Saturday tacitly acknowledging that the constituent assembly vote would be held, but calling on the assembly\u2019s powers to be limited and for firm dates for local and presidential elections to be set.\u201cToday and tomorrow are transcendental for Venezuela,\u201d Zapatero said in the statement. He called on the government to make \u201cnew gestures\u201d to help ease tensions but did not call for the vote to be cancelled.The opposition also appeared resigned to seeing the vote take place. \u201cBut we are not backing down because our problem is not the constituent assembly, it is the dictatorship,\u201d said Guevara in a statement.\u201cWhat comes after Sunday will not be easy for us,\u201d he said, adding however that the \u201cdeepening of the crisis will affect those in government much more\u201d.But polls show that 70% of Venezuelans do not want a constituent assembly, although turnout on Sunday may not reflect that. To avoid an embarrassingly low turnout, government officials and pro-government neighbourhood committees have been warning that people who do not show up for the vote may lose their jobs, essential food subsidies or homes.Delcy Leonor Medina, a 52-year-old housekeeper, said she and her neighbours in a working-class district of Caracas face the threat of armed muggings and murders.Now they face an added threat of losing their government-subsidised homes if they don\u2019t vote. But she remained defiant. \u201cI\u2019m not giving that bastard anything. If the constituent assembly is voted in, I may have to leave here,\u201d she said.Many of Venezuela\u2019s 2.8 million state workers have reported getting text messages, phone calls and being required to attend political rallies during work hours, according to Reuters.Early on Saturday, the opposition coalition\u2019s website appeared to have been hacked, showing a message saying \u201cYanquis, leave our America\u201d with a photo of the US president, Donald Trump. Hours later, the site showed a message reading \u201cDemocracy cannot be hacked.\u201dCilia Flores, Maduro\u2019s wife and a candidate for the assembly, said the new body with supra-legislative powers would create a commission to punish those responsible for the political upheaval. They will \u201cpay and learn their lesson\u201d, she said, playing on the fears of the opposition that they will suffer further persecution.Diosdado Cabello, the first vice-president of Venezuela\u2019s socialist party, said the assembly will strip legislators in the opposition-controlled National Assembly of their immunity from prosecution. He said the office of Venezuela\u2019s chief prosecutor, who recently became one of Maduro\u2019s most outspoken critics, would be \u201cturned upside down\u201d.The US has led other nations in imposing targeted sanctions against 13 current and former officials close to the government. They were followed by similar measures by Mexico and Colombia.US vice-president Mike Pence spoke by phone with opposition leader and political prisoner Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, sentenced to 14 years for inciting violence, charges human rights groups have said were trumped up. Pence told L\u00f3pez, who was transferred to house arrest earlier this month, that the United States \u201cstands with the Venezuelan people\u201d.The Trump administration has threatened further measures if the vote goes ahead, which may target the country\u2019s oil industry, one of the few economic lifelines left in Venezuela.Colombia\u2019s president Juan Manuel Santos, who is often the target of Maduro\u2019s public rants of an international conspiracy against him, said he would not recognise the constituent assembly, which he called \u201cspurious\u201d.In a tacit recognition of the growing humanitarian and political crisis, the Colombian government said on Friday it was granting a special permit for Venezuelans already in the country to remain for up to two years.And more than one Venezuelan is preparing to pack his bags and join the growing number of people fleeing.Carlos, a 24-year-old student at the Metropolitan University in Caracas, said most of his friends are leaving the country. His parents have said that if the constituent assembly is voted in, they want him to join them. \u201cI would lose my family, my home, my friends, my university,\u201d said Carlos, who declined to give his real name. But he also holds another fear. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of losing my country,\u201d he said.Additional reporting by Ana Sofia Romero in Caracas.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate demonstrations  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protests <extra_id_0> Demonstrator the opposition <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate clashes <extra_id_0> Demonstrator protesters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protests <extra_id_0> Target the government <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrator Opposition <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce threat  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate demonstrations <extra_id_0> Demonstrator the opposition <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim 113 people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim 2,000 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protests  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact statement <extra_id_0> Communicator Zapatero <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact statement <extra_id_0> Communicator Guevara <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce threat <extra_id_0> Recipient Delcy Leonor Medina <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce threat <extra_id_0> Recipient they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentenced <extra_id_0> Defendant Leopoldo L\u00f3pez <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee L\u00f3pez <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce threatened <extra_id_0> Communicator administration <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Venezuela <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Diosdado Cabello <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Carlos <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Carlos <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "US Jury to Decide: Death or Life in Prison for Boston Marathon BomberAfter convicting Chechen immigrant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev of the deadly 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, jurors will take a few days off before deciding whether to sentence him to death or life in prison.After two days of deliberations in a federal trial, the jury convicted Tsarnaev Wednesday of all 30 charges he faced, including 17 that carry a possible death penalty. The sentencing phase of the trial, which could begin as early as Monday, will be held in the same U.S. courtroom.Jurors would have to vote unanimously to sentence the 21-year-old to death.The defense lawyers, who barely cross-examined the prosecution's witnesses during the first part of the trial, are expected to become much more aggressive during the penalty phase, when they will make a case that Tsarnaev's life should be spared.ConvictionTsarnaev's conviction was practically a foregone conclusion: His lawyers admitted he participated in the bombings, in which two homemade, shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs were placed near the finish line of the annual race. The explosion killed three people, including an 8-year-old boy, and injured another 264, with 17 people losing limbs and many others maimed from flying shrapnel.But during the trial, defense attorney Judy Clarke argued that Tsarnaev, then 19, fell under the influence of his radicalized older brother, Tamerlan, 26.Clarke, who has successfully kept other notorious U.S. murder convicts off death row, told the jury in her closing argument, \"If not for Tamerlan, it [the bombing] would not have happened.\"Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed days after the April 15, 2013, blasts, when he was shot by police and run over by his brother during a chaotic getaway attempt. The brothers also shot to death a university patrol officer while attempting to flee authorities.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who lived in the United States for a decade before the bombings, was later found hiding in a boat parked in the backyard of a suburban Boston home.Prosecutors said he scrawled a motive for the attack on the inside wall of the boat, writing that the brothers were trying to avenge American attacks on Muslims in the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Defense caseLegal analysts said they don't expect the defense case to contain any new revelations about Tsarnaev.\"The crime is so horrific that they don't have much else really to point to, other than his age and the influence of his older brother,\" said Dan Collins, a former federal prosecutor who handled the case against a suspect in the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India.\"At this point, it's going to be the life experiences and the perspectives of the jurors in deciding whether or not they believe that these points are strong enough that his life should be spared,\" Collins said.Meg Penrose, a death penalty expert and professor at Texas A&M University School of Law, said it will be difficult for the jury to overcome the image of Tsarnaev planting a bomb just behind a group of children, including 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was killed.\"In a crime of this magnitude, what American citizen wouldn't ask, 'What would drive a person to do this?' And, as a juror, the question becomes, what answer would satisfy you?\" she said.Massachusetts has not executed anyone since 1947.The city's mayor, Marty Walsh, said he was glad to see the trial moving toward a conclusion.\"I am thankful that this phase of the trial has come to an end and am hopeful for a swift sentencing process,\" Walsh said. \"I hope [Wednesday\u2019s] verdict provides a small amount of closure for the survivors, families, and all impacted by the violent and tragic events.\"Tsarnaev relativeMeanwhile, in Russia, a relative of the brothers said she remains \"completely convinced that they were not guilty of this.\"\"These boys didn't need this,\" Rosa Tsarnaeva, a 66-year-old cousin of Tsarnaev's father, told The Associated Press. \"They never saw war, they were little when they arrived in the U.S. and grew up there.\"No one in the Tsarnaev family, none of the relatives, ever took part in the military campaigns in Chechnya\" in which separatists, some of them radical Islamists, fought two wars against Russian troops, she said.The brothers' father, who also lives in Russia, has not answered repeated phone calls or responded to text messages seeking his comment.Some material for this report came from AP and Reuters.Watch a related video report by VOA's Zlatica Hoke:Video sizewidthxheightpixelsBoston Jury to Mull Life or Death for TsarnaevShare this video0:03:18\u25b60:00:00/0:03:18\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 6.0MB360p | 8.5MB486p | 70.7MB/*<![CDATA[*/initInfographics({groups:[],params:[{\"Name\":\"embed_code\",\"Value\":\"\\u0026lt;div class=\\\"storify\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;iframe src=\\\"//storify.com/voa_news/boston-bomber-convicted-on-all-counts/embed?border=false\\\" width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"750\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" allowtransparency=\\\"true\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/iframe\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;script src=\\\"//storify.com/voa_news/boston-bomber-convicted-on-all-counts.js?border=false\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/script\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;noscript\\u0026gt;[\\u0026lt;a href=\\\"//storify.com/voa_news/boston-bomber-convicted-on-all-counts\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u0026gt;View the story \\\"Boston Bomber Convicted on All Counts\\\" on Storify\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;]\\u0026lt;/noscript\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;\",\"DefaultValue\":\"\",\"HtmlEncode\":false,\"Type\":\"String\"}],isMobile:true});Error rendering storify.(function(d){var userInput = Infographics.Param[\"embed_code\"],notRenderedS = d.querySelectorAll(\".storifySnippet:not(.storifySnippetRendered)\"),render = function() {try {var oEval = d.createElement(\"div\");oEval.innerHTML = userInput;} catch(e) {var snippets = d.getElementsByClassName(\"storifySnippet\");var lastSnippet = snippets[snippets.length -

{"text": "French police are hunting a suspect believed to have deposited a paper bag containing a device that exploded on Friday, wounding 13 people on a busy pedestrian street in the city of Lyon.France\u2019s counter-terrorism prosecutor, Remy Heitz, said an investigation has been opened for an \u201cattempted murder in relation with a terrorist undertaking\u201d and \u201ccriminal terrorist association\u201d.He said no group had yet claimed responsibility for the explosion. Regional authorities said 13 people had suffered mostly minor injuries but 11 were still in hospital on Saturday morning.On Friday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, called the explosion an \u201cattack\u201d.Heitz described video surveillance that showed the suspect heading toward the centre of Lyon by bike on Friday afternoon. The man was seen arriving on foot, pushing his bike along the pedestrian-only Victor Hugo street, then leaving a paper bag on a concrete block in the middle of the street near a bakery.French police issued this photo from CCTV showing a man wanted in connection with the explosion. Photograph: Police National/Handout/EPAThe suspect immediately returned to his bike and left by the same path. One minute later, the explosion shattered the glass of a refrigerator in the bakery, Heitz said.Investigators at the scene have found screws, metallic balls, batteries, a triggering device that can be used remotely and plastic pieces that may come from the explosive device.Police issued an appeal for witnesses on Saturday with a photo of the suspect from video surveillance. They described the man as dangerous. The man was wearing a cap and sunglasses that partially hid his face.Local authorities said security has been enhanced in France\u2019s third-largest city, including more police and military patrols.The Women\u2019s Football World Cup is scheduled to start in France on 7 June. Lyon will host the semi-finals and then the 7 July final. After the explosion, the interior minister, Christophe Castaner, sent instructions for Lyon authorities to strengthen security for \u201cpublic sites and sporting, cultural and religious events\u201d.On Victor Hugo street, police removed the cordon around the explosion area and the atmosphere on Saturday was almost back to normal, with people doing their shopping \u2013 the only oddity being the chalk lines drawn by forensics on the ground.\u201cIt was scary,\u201d said Gisele Sanchez, owner of a haberdashery close to the bakery. Large wood planks covered her shop window, which was damaged by the blast. Police found in her shop screws, metallic balls and batteries believed to be from the device, yet Sanchez was able to reopen on Saturday morning.France is jittery over a spate of attacks in recent years, some of them deadly, carried out by people ranging from extremist attackers to mentally unstable individuals. Five people were killed on 11 December in an attack on the Christmas market in Strasbourg, eastern France. The alleged killer, Ch\u00e9rif Chekatt \u2013 shot dead by police \u2013 had pledged allegiance to Islamic State.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> Place Lyon <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounding <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Victim 11 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation heading toward <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand sent <extra_id_0> Recipient authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator Christophe Castaner <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle damaged <extra_id_0> Artifact shop <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target market <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Strasbourg <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shot <extra_id_0> Target Ch\u00e9rif Chekatt <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Killer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim Ch\u00e9rif Chekatt <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime hunting <extra_id_0> Investigator police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack murder  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact issued <extra_id_0> Communicator police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Target bakery <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact issued  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker individuals <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Lawyers for the coroner in charge of inquests into the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings have said the hearings will not resolve the \u201cenduring injustice\u201d for victims and their families.Sir Peter Thornton QC is challenging a High Court ruling which ordered him to reconsider his decision to exclude an enquiry into the identities of those who \u201cplanted, planned, procured and authorised the bombs\u201d.The bombings in two city centre pubs, widely believed to be the work of the IRA, killed 21 people and injured 182 \u2013 making it the deadliest peacetime attack in the UK at the time.For the reasons the coroner gave ... these inquests cannot resolve the enduring injustice. Peter Skelton QC, for the coronerOutlining his submissions to the Court of Appeal, Peter Skelton QC said: \u201cThe 21 people who died in the bombings and their families have suffered an enduring injustice.\u201cSo too have those who were injured and their families, and countless others who have been affected.\u201cThe pain and grief they have borne has been exacerbated by the fact no-one has ever been held accountable in law.\u201cBut, for the reasons the coroner gave \u2026 these inquests cannot resolve the enduring injustice.\u201dMr Skelton, representing the coroner, added that the victims, their families and the public interest \u201ccannot be served\u201d by a promised resolution that \u201ccannot be delivered\u201d.Two High Court judges quashed a decision by Sir Peter to exclude the \u201cperpetrator issue\u201d from the new hearings following a judicial review brought on behalf of the bereaved families by Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was 18 when she was killed in the bombings.Ten of the families were in court on Tuesday to hear the appeal before the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Burnett, Lady Justice Hallett and Lord Justice McCombe.They are also arguing it is necessary for the inquests to investigate the perpetrator issue because the police investigation into the bombings resulted in a \u201cnotorious miscarriage of justice\u201d.Six men, known as the Birmingham Six, were imprisoned for the murders and served 17 years behind bars in one of Britain\u2019s most infamous miscarriages of justice before their convictions were quashed.Five West Midlands Police officers were charged with perverting the course of justice in connection with the original criminal investigation, but a judge ruled in 1993 that a fair trial would be impossible.There has never been an effective and independent investigation into who was responsible for the atrocity Hugh Southey QC, for the familesHugh Southey QC, representing the families, said there was the \u201cmost pressing need for a thorough investigation\u201d.He told the court: \u201cThe actions of West Midlands Police officers in the investigation and subsequent criminal convictions are often considered to be the worst miscarriage of justice in British legal history.\u201cThere has never been an effective and independent investigation into who was responsible for the atrocity.\u201cThere is no prospect of such an investigation occurring, apart from within the inquest.\u201cDespite that, the appellant decided not to investigate the issue of who was responsible.\u201dMr Southey later added: \u201cThere is the utmost public interest in the proper investigation of who was responsible for the Birmingham bombings.\u201cThe families of the deceased said to the appellant that the investigation of this issue was so important to them that if it did not form part of the scope of the inquest \u2018we may as well not have an inquest at all\u2019.\u201dSpeaking before the hearing, Mrs Hambleton said: \u201cIt will be utterly redundant to have the inquests unless the perpetrators, their associates and those who prepared and planted the bombs are included.\u201dShe said supporters of the families\u2019 campaign group Justice4the21 have so far raised \u00a375,000 for the case after Mrs Hambleton was refused legal aid.The group held a demonstration outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London in February, supported by members of the Football Lads Alliance.The hearing is due to finish on Tuesday afternoon and the judges are

{"text": "Attack on a military base and police training centre comes a day after an assault in Logar province that killed eight.Dozens of Afghan security forces were killed when armed Taliban fighters attacked a military base about 44km southwest of Kabul on Monday.Afghan officials say the death toll is at least 45, according to the Associated Press news agency, while others put it higher.Provincial Council Member Nafisa Selai Wardak said at least 126 members were killed in the attack that began Monday morning when a suicide bomber detonated his explosive-laden vehicle outside the base in Maidan Shahr, the capital of Wardak province.Another provincial council member, Khawanin Sultani, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the attack also left more than 70 wounded.Intially the government had said 12 people were killed and about 30 were wounded.Some of the injured were in provincial hospitals, while the more serious cases were being treated in Kabul, said Salem Asgherkhail, head of the area\u2019s public health department.The New York Times reported the base was a training centre for the country\u2019s national intelligence service, the NDS.If true, this would be the intelligence agency\u2019s largest single loss of life in the 17-year war.The Taliban claimed responsibility for the coordinated attack, according to Nasrat Rahimi, the deputy spokesman for the Interior Ministry.Armed Taliban fighters then moved in, a tactic the group has used in many previous attacks.The attack came a day after a Taliban assault in the neighbouring Logar province killed eight security forces.The Taliban has been on the offensive in recent months, attacking targets around the country in an apparent effort to expand their influence and perhaps to gain more leverage in any future peace talks.According to data from the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), the Taliban controls or contests nearly half of Afghanistan.Since July, the US has tried to restart a peace process with the Taliban. US officials have met Taliban representatives in a number of countries. The Taliban has refused to meet Afghan government officials, calling them \u201cpuppets\u201d.US Senator Lindsey Graham said in Pakistan on Sunday President Donald Trump should meet Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan as soon as possible to reset long-difficult US relations and push for a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan.US relations with Pakistan have been strained by suspicions that elements in the Pakistani establishment were aiding the Taliban, a charge Islamabad strongly denies. However, relations have appeared to improve in recent months amid efforts to push the armed group towards a peace deal.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack assault <extra_id_0> Place Logar province <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack Attack <extra_id_0> Target base <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim forces <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacked <extra_id_0> Attacker fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target base <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> Attacker suicide bomber <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place base <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosive <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack killed <extra_id_0> Target members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim 70 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim 30 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assault <extra_id_0> Place Logar province <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Taliban <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact met <extra_id_0> Participant officials <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim eight <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim forces <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Logar province <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target 70 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Intervention treated <extra_id_0> Place Kabul <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

Stephen was fourteen and a half years old when he bacame a victim of what has come to be known in the history of Northern Ireland as the Bloody Friday outrage on July 21st, 1972. He died as he endeavoured to warn others of the presence of an unexploded car bomb. An innocent victim of a terrorist outrage in a purely residential area of the City.The Stephen Parker Memorial Trust was born out of this tragic situation. Knowing how much Stephen appreciated his place in the CBYO, his parents decided that his memorial had to be capable of contributing in the long term towards \"the life and welfare of his beloved orchestra.\" A substantial sum of money donated at the time of Stephen's death was invested and has been further added to over the years. Each year 75% of the annual income of this investment is awarded as a prize to \"the member or members of the City of Belfast Youth Orchestra who make the best all round progress during the year.\" Students are then free to use this award to further their musical study through assisting with lessons or masterclasses or contributing towards the purchase of equipment.The residual amount is reinvested to maintain the value of the prize.Stephen was a trier and his parents felt it appropriate that \"evidence of having tried very hard\" ought to be the major factor in deciding eligibility for his memorial prize.Each year the trustees of the memorial meet to decide upon a winner based on evidence provided by the Orchestra staff. The winner is announced and the recipient presented with the award during the Orchestra's Summer Concert.The Stephen Parker Memorial Trust is administered by the Belfast Education and Library Board.Anyone wishing to make a donation to the trust can do so care of :Mrs Rowena EamesHead of Music ServicesCity of Belfast School of Music99 Donegall PassBelfastBT7 1DRThis year's winner of the Stephen Parker AwardMalachy Frame with conductor of CBYO, Paul McBriePrevious Winners2011 Malachy Frame2010 Susanna Gawn2009 Emma King2008 David Douglas2007 Christopher Rooney2006 Charles Reilly2005 Sarah Brown2004 Michael Trainor2003 David McCann2002 Ciaran McCabe2001 Scott Foster2000 Jonathan Corry / Michael McHale1999 Jonathan Coffey1998 Peter Black1997 Roger McCann1996 Kate Openshaw1995 Natalie Thompson1994 Anne Harper1993 S Nesbitt1992 Robin Clinton1991 M C Lowry1990 A Carney1989 C Taylor1988 J Fleming1987 Ruth Montgomery1986 Nigel Ireland1985 Cheryl Agnew1984 Marianne Ho / Ruth Kilpatrick1983 Janet McMaster / Margaret Flanagan1982 David McMaster1981 Rosin McCrisken1980 Kathryn Clements / Jennifer McCreery1979 Eleanor Wilkinson1978 Pauline Fitzpartick1977 Paul McCrisken1976 Jeremy Adair1975 Hazel Mulligan / Dominic McHugh1974 Noleen Bell / John Anderson1973 Charles Wood", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The Islamic Society of Boston, in Cambridge (Joe Spurr/WBUR)We're learning more about the brothers suspected of the Marathon bombing. The older of the alleged Marathon bombers, Tamarlan Tsarnaev, started attending Friday prayers at the Islamic Society of Boston, in Cambridge, about a year-and-a-half ago.Anwar Kazmi, a member of the executive board of the Islamic Society of Boston, addresses reporters Monday. (Fred Thys/WBUR)Tsarnaev called attention to himself during one prayer service earlier this year. It happened on Jan. 18 \u2014 the Friday prayers just before Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\"The theme of the sermon was about great men like Dr. Martin Luther King, like the prophet, what drove them, their sense of mission, what we could learn from their lives and how we could be inspired by their example, and so when the person who was giving the sermon began to talk about King, [Tsarnaev] got up and objected and raised his voice, which is against the etiquette of the sermon,\" Anwar Kazmi, a board member of the Islamic Society of Boston Trust, told reporters Monday in front of the small mosque on busy Prospect Street in Cambridge.Kazmi said different people have different memories of what Tsarnaev said that day. Kazmi said some people reported Tsarnaev objected to comparing King to the prophet Mohammed. Others have reported he called the speaker a hypocrite. Kazmi said after the incident, people sat down with Tsarnaev and explained to him that he could not interrupt the sermon.\"And he seemed to understand and nothing happened after that,\" Kazmi said. \"He continued to come to the mosque even after the incident.\"Kazmi said one man remembers a positive experience with Tsarnaev. The man ran out of gas, and Tsarnaev ran over to his apartment, got a gas can, filled it up, and brought it to the man.Kazmi said Tsarnaev's younger brother, Dzhokhar, only came once to Friday prayers.\"And I have been told that on occasion, they would also come here for the dawn prayers, and that the younger one sometimes came accompanied by his older brother,\" Kazmi said. \"The younger one never came here by himself.\"Kazmi said several members of the congregation are still being interviewed by the FBI about the brothers.

{"text": "AbstractThe Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995 was a watershed moment in American history and indelibly changed the way Americans viewed terrorism and public safety. While the effects of the bombing are well-documented, not as much attention has been paid to the motivations of the bomber, Timothy McVeigh. He was spurred to action by the events of the Waco siege, where the FBI engaged in a 51-day standoff with the Branch Davidians, a small religious group suspected of owning illegal weapons. However, this was not the first incident that inspired his later actions. In 1992, the Weaver family entered into their own standoff against federal agents, after Randy Weaver failed to show up to court on illegal weapons charges. Over the course of the standoff, his wife, Vicki Weaver, and twelve-year-old son Samuel were killed. Both Waco and Ruby Ridge galvanized the far right, who saw it as the government using deadly force against their own citizens, who merely wished to live their lives as they saw fit. McVeigh was further influenced by The Turner Diaries, a novel in which the protagonist blows up a government building as a part of a revolution against the government. These three factors are analyzed in regards to the influence they had on McVeigh\u2019s decision to attack the Murrah building.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Oklahoma City <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Timothy McVeigh <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Samuel <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blows <extra_id_0> Attacker protagonist <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target Murrah building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker McVeigh <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack standoff <extra_id_0> Attacker FBI <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Waco <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target group <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack standoff <extra_id_0> Attacker agents <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target family <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

It is frustrating to hide the facts,\" a senior interior ministry official in Kabul said.The complex attack on a highly secured base underlined the heavy pressure facing Afghan security forces as increasingly confident Taliban fighters have stepped up operations, even as diplomatic efforts to agree a peaceful settlement to the conflict have begun.Local officials said scores of troops and security personnel were killed in the attack. ( Tolo News via Storyful )Taliban insurgents, fighting to drive out international forces from Afghanistan and reintroduce their version of strict Islamic law, claimed responsibility for the attack, which spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said killed 190 people.The attack, the most serious against Afghan forces in months, occurred on the same day that Taliban representatives met Zalmay Khalilzad, the US special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, in Qatar.Last week, Taliban fighters set off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five people and wounding more than 110 in the capital Kabul, but casualties from Monday's attack appear to have been far higher.'Many more were killed'Sharif Hotak, a member of the provincial council in Maidan Wardak, said he saw the bodies of 35 members of the Afghan forces in the hospital.\"Many more were killed. Several bodies were transported to Kabul city and many injured were transferred to hospitals in Kabul,\" said Mr Hotak, adding that \"the Government was hiding the accurate casualty figures to prevent a further dip in morale of the Afghan forces.\"Monday's attack caused the biggest casualty total suffered by Afghan forces since August 2018, when the Taliban overran central Ghazni province.That confrontation killed 150 Afghan security forces and 95 civilians, as well as hundreds of Taliban fighters, officials said at the time.President Ashraf Ghani's office said in a statement the \"enemies of the country\" had carried out the attack and had killed and wounded \"a number of our beloved and honest sons\".In recent years the Afghan Government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures but US commanders have said repeatedly that the losses being suffered by Afghan forces are \"unsustainable\".Last year Mr Ghani said 28,000 Afghan police officers and soldiers had been killed since 2015.The British embassy in Afghanistan said Monday's casualties were \"a stark reminder of the sacrifice the Afghan security and defence forces make for their country\".Reuters", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize saw  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounding <extra_id_0> Victim 110 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injurer fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killing <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> Attacker fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place highly fortified compound <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target 110 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack confrontation  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place training centre <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Questions have been raised in recent days about the political and religious beliefs of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bombing suspect killed in a gunfight with police in the early hours of Friday.Anecdotes suggest that Tamerlan became more religious in the last several years and may have embraced more conservative Islamic ideas, although no link has been established between him and any known terrorist group.On Monday, a spokesman for the Islamic Society of Boston, a Cambridge mosque frequented by Tamerlan, contributed to the emerging debate over the suspect\u2019s religious beliefs by sharing an anecdote from a January talk at the mosque, during which Tamerlan disrupted the event and insulted the speaker, accusing him of deviating from Islam by comparing the Prophet Muhammad to Martin Luther King Jr.It was the second time that Tamerlan disrupted an event at the mosque because he felt that its religious message was too liberal, said the spokesman, Yusufi Vali, according to a report in The Boston Globe.In disrupting the talk in January at the Islamic Society of Boston mosque in Cambridge, Tamerlan Tsarnaev\u2019s shouted at a speaker: \u201cYou are a Kafir\u201d \u2014 a nonbeliever, according to Yusufi Vali, a spokesman for the mosque.Tsarnaev went on to say the speaker was contaminating people\u2019s minds and accused him of being a hypocrite.The congregation disagreed, according to Vali, and \u201cshouted him out of the mosque\u201d on Prospect Street.Tsarnaev also interrupted a talk last November when a speaker said it was fine for people to celebrate holidays such as Thanksgiving and July 4, in the same way you celebrate the birthday of the Prophet.Tsarnaev challenged him and the two talked after service.\u201cThe brother was angry, but he left,\u2019\u2019 Vali said.The Islamic Society of Boston issued a news release on Monday afternoon detailing the organization\u2019s interactions with the suspects, who it said were \u201cneither members nor regular attendees\u201d of religious services there.The statement focused almost exclusively on Tamerlan, who the organization said had begun coming \u201cintermittently\u201d to weekly Friday Prayers and \u201coccasionally\u201d to daily services about a year ago.It said Dzhokhar \u201cwas rarely seen at the center, coming only occasionally for prayer.\u201dThe statement included lengthy descriptions of the incidents in January and November when Tamerlan disrupted events at the mosque, leading the community there to reprimand and ostracize him.On November 16, 2012, at our weekly congregational prayer, one of our preachers sermonized that it was appropriate to celebrate national holidays like July 4th and Thanksgiving, just like the birthday of the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him).The older suspect stood up during the sermon and challenged the preacher, arguing that celebration of any holiday was not allowed in the faith.After the sermon ended and the congregational prayer was finished, the preacher met with the older suspect to share his opinion.The suspect repeatedly argued his viewpoint, and then left.On January 18, 2013, one of our preachers noted that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a great person remembered in history.The older suspect stood up, shouted and called him a \u201cnonbeliever\u201d; said that he was \u201ccontaminating people\u2019s minds\u201d; and began calling him a hypocrite.People of the congregation, in turn, shouted back at the older suspect, \u201cLeave now!\u201d Due to the congregation\u2019s disapproval, he left the sermon.After the sermon and the congregational prayer ended, a few volunteer leaders of the mosque sat down with the older suspect and gave him a clear choice: either he stops interrupting sermons and remains silent or he would not be welcomed.While he continued to attend some of the congregational prayers after the January incident, he neither interrupted another sermon nor did he cause any other disturbances.The statement said that no member of the mosque\u2019s board or staff \u201cever interacted\u201d with either Dzhokhar or Tamerlan, who it said \u201cdisagreed with the moderate American-Islamic theology of the I.S.B.Cambridge mosque.\u201d\u201cOur mosque is one filled with attendees who are teachers, businessmen, doctors and lawyers, all of whom are committed to the public good,\u201d the statement said.\u201cWhile these suspects did express views counter to our mosque\u2019s philosophy, they never expressed any hint of violent sentiments or behavior.If they had, the F.B.I.would have immediately been called.\u201dOn Saturday, the mosque posted a long note on its front door, which was photographed and uploaded to Twitter by several people, including Steve Annear, a freelance journalist and contributor to Boston Magazine.Here is the note about the bombing suspects on the door of the Islamic Society of Boston.They were guest s there.//t.co/vdv1ZWxagi \u2014 Steve Annear (@steveannear) 21 Apr 13The note expressed shock and sadness at the bombing of the Boston Marathon and urged members of the congregation to contact the F.B.I.with any information they may have about the Tsarnaev brothers.The statement was also posted on the mosque\u2019s Web site.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston Marathon <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact contributed <extra_id_0> Participant spokesman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Cambridge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic beliefs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Prophet <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact issued <extra_id_0> Communicator Islamic Society of Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact posted <extra_id_0> Communicator mosque <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Steve Annear <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic note <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

The republic is also famed for its ethnic and linguistic diversity, being home to more than 30 languages.Several dozen Muslim peoples have settled among the high valleys over the centuries.image copyright AFP image caption Villages cling to steep hillsides in Dagestan's spectacular mountainous interiorThe Avars form the largest ethnic group and account for about a fifth of the population. A further substantial proportion is made up of Dargins, Kumyks and Lezgins. About 10 per cent are ethnic Russians. There are also Laks, Tabasarans and Nogai, to name but a few of the other significant groups.The republic's constitution declares the protection of the interests of all of Dagestan's peoples to be a fundamental principle. It is a delicate balance to maintain, in what is Russia's most ethnically diverse province.The republic has oil and gas reserves and also the fisheries potential offered by a share in the resources of the Caspian sea. However, it is prey to organized crime and regional instability. The crime barons may prosper but the people are amongst the poorest in Russia.HistoryDagestan was the birth place of Imam Shamil, the legendary fighter who in the 19th century spearheaded fierce resistance by tribesmen of Chechnya and Dagestan to the spread of the Russian empire. His name is still revered by many in both republics.image copyright AFP image caption Federal troops were deployed to repel incursions by Chechen militants in the 1990sWhen the Bolsheviks sought to enforce control in the Caucasus in the early 1920s, Dagestan became an autonomous Soviet republic within the Russian Federation. During the Stalinist period, its peoples escaped the mass deportation inflicted on their Chechen neighbours and many others.After the fall of the Soviet Union, the republic's authorities stayed loyal to Russia, but the region became infamous for its lawlessness and corruption. Organised crime is reported to flourish and kidnappings and violence are commonplace. Firearms are ubiquitous and assassinations are a regular event.Moscow blames much of this on Chechen-based separatism, but others say lust for profit, combined with a gun culture, is the root cause.Budennovsk and beyondIn the 1990s, separatist warlords from neighbouring Chechen openly led armed operations in Dagestan on several occasions. In 1995 and 1996, they seized hundreds of hostages in hospitals in the Dagestani towns of Budennovsk and Kizlyar. Scores died in the attacks.image copyright AFP image caption Dagestan sees frequent attacks on security forces and assassinationsDagestan's Muslims, who tend to follow sufism combined with local tradition, generally steered clear of Chechen-style separatism, but after the late 1990s, radical and militant elements said to be linked with the more fundamentalist wahhabist tendency began to gain in influence.In August 1999, an Islamic body declared an independent state in parts of Dagestan and Chechnya, and called on Muslims to take up arms against Russia in a holy war.Chechen fighters crossed into Dagestan in support, but within a few weeks, Russian forces had suppressed the insurrection.The republic has seen numerous bombings targeted at the Russian military stationed in the republic.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Contact declares <extra_id_0> Participant republic <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ImpedeInterfereWith resistance <extra_id_0> Impeder tribesmen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ImpedeInterfereWith repel <extra_id_0> Impeder troops <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack Firearms  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassinations  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact blames <extra_id_0> Participant Moscow <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact say <extra_id_0> Participant others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic cause <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain seized <extra_id_0> Detainee hostages <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place towns <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Scores <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Target forces <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassinations  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact declared <extra_id_0> Participant body <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand called <extra_id_0> Recipient Muslims <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator body <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation crossed <extra_id_0> Transporter fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination Dagestan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ImpedeInterfereWith suppressed <extra_id_0> Impeder forces <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Target military <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place republic <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation escaped <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact peoples <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "SANTIAGO, CHILE - A former top Venezuelan security official says video reports from Sunday's drone attack on President Nicolas Maduro demonstrate serious shortcomings in the response of the bodyguards protecting the increasingly embattled leader.\"Maduro's security was shown to be deficient,\" said retired Venezuelan Vice Admiral Mario Carratu, who has headed security teams for previous Venezuelan presidents, in a telephone interview with VOA. \"His bodyguards were slow to react and seemed to lack an evacuation plan for the president.\"Carratu said video of the incident, in which two drones exploded near a reviewing stand without injuring Maduro, suggested the president's security detail did not have an effective evacuation plan in place.The former admiral's analysis dovetails with public comments from disaffected former Venezuelan military officers who have gone public with claims to have been responsible for the assassination attempt.\"We showed that the regime is vulnerable. We didn't make it, but it's a matter of time before we do,\" said Salvatore Lucchese, a former Caracas police chief now in exile.Venezuelan opposition activist Salvatore Lucchese Venezuelan opposition activist Salvatore Lucchese speaks during an interview with Reuters in Bogota, Colombia Aug. 6, 2018. Venezuelan opposition activist Salvatore Lucchese speaks during an interview with Reuters in Bogota, Colombia Aug. 6, 2018.Lucchese claimed to have been part of the plot in an interview with Reuters this week in which he called for an armed overthrow of Maduro's leftist regime.Maduro was addressing a ceremony of the paramilitary National Guard in central Caracas when he came under attack from two drones packed with explosives. The government claims that one of the drones was diverted electronically while the second crashed into a nearby apartment building.Carratu confirmed that Venezuela, a longtime ally of Cuba, has the technology to electronically penetrate and interfere with the electronic signals of aircraft. But he ridiculed claims made on Twitter by persons saying they were involved in the attack that the drones had been shot down with firearms.\"Plastic explosives can't be detonated with bullets. They more likely exploded prematurely due to poor preparations by the hit team,\" he said.Lucchese's claim of responsibility for the attack came Wednesday but could not be independently confirmed. Responsibility has been claimed by a confusing array of spokesmen purporting to represent former and active members of Venezuela's security services, going by various names including \"The Resistance,\" \"Fenix Group\" and \"Soldiers in T Shirts.\"Lucchese was jailed by the Venezuelan government in 2014 for refusing orders to suppress opposition protests in his city. He took up political activity upon his release in 2016, when he objected to political negotiations with Maduro, but fled the country shortly afterward to avoid being arrested again.He did not reveal his location in the Reuters interview, but members of the Venezuelan government assert that he is in neighboring Colombia, a country that Maduro accuses of backing attempts to topple him.Exiled Venezuelan opposition journalist Patricia Poleo, long known for her close connections with the military, broadcast a statement from Miami that she claimed had been issued by officers in Venezuela. It said the officers were resorting to \"armed struggle\" because \"the regime has consistently ignored the constitution.\"Some opposition leaders have cast doubts on the claims of responsibility, suggesting instead that the attack was staged by the government to justify further repression.Julio Borges, president of the Venezuelan parliame Julio Borges, president of the Venezuelan parliament, arrives for a meeting with Ernesto Macias, president of Colombia's Senate, at the Congress in Bogota, Colombia, Aug. 8, 2018. Julio Borges, president of the Venezuelan parliament, arrives for a meeting with Ernesto Macias, president of Colombia's Senate, at the Congress in Bogota, Colombia, Aug. 8, 2018.The Maduro government this week has rounded up a half dozen military officers it accused of conducting the attacks and has issued arrest warrants for at least two opposition leaders, including congressional Speaker Julio Borges, who is in Colombia.Lucchese's police background crisscrossed with that of police lnspector Oscar Perez,who last year attacked Venezuela's Supreme Court from a helicopter with hand grenades and machine-gun fire. The attack came as the court's seven judges assumed the powers of parliament to allow Maduro to rule autocratically.Perez also machine-gunned a building housing Maduro's new handpicked national assembly, which had just ousted Attorney General Luisa Ortega for accusing Maduro of corruption and authoritarian rule.The Caracas metropolitan police, which has been largely dissolved by the Maduro government, maintained close links with opposition leaders. Lucchese was a member of the same Christian democratic First Justice party as Caracas Mayor Leopoldo Lopez, one of the most charismatic anti- government leaders who has been repeatedly imprisoned by Maduro.Perez was a subordinate to Lucchese in the police criminal investigations unit and the special operations brigade.

{"text": "Latest news straight to your inbox Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Invalid EmailOn the night of the bomb attacks M J Niels McGuinness was working as a photographer for the Press Association. With local journalists on strike, pictures and accounts from the night can often seem somewhat sparce. Here's his account of that terrible evening, as told to Carl Chinn.November 21, 1974 was a night I shall never forget. My memories of that night have not changed, they have remained with me.Working as a press photographer for the National news agency, The Press Association I was requested earlier in the day to cover the funeral arrangements of a Provisional IRA terrorist, James McDade at Birmingham Airport. A week earlier he had blown himself up when he tried to plant a bomb at the Coventry Telephone Exchange in Little Park Street.There had been a feeling of high tension after the Coventry incident. Indeed, there had been a spate of terrorist activities in the Midlands leading up to the Birmingham pub bombings.At the airport, cargo staff refused to load McDade's coffin on a Belfast bound flight where he was to be buried. Hundreds of police surrounded the terminals searching everyone entering the building and the car parking areas.Eventually it was agreed on compassionate grounds to have his body flown to Dublin. My films of the activities at the airport were handed to a dispatch rider for processing at the Press Association office in Fleet Street.My first impression when I arrived in the Bull Ring was like the Blitz all over again, broken plate glass windows littered the surrounding streets, people were running all over the place, I must have got there within minutes of the explosions.I carried two Pentax cameras loaded with black and white film when I entered the Mulberry Bush. It was a scene of total carnage, bodies all over the place which were covered with debris and rafters from the ceiling and the floor above, the whole interior of the pub was ripped apart.As I tried to tread discreetly amongst the rubble and broken furniture I was unable to find anyone who might possibly be still alive. Firemen rushed in to remove the unfortunate victims away. One of them tapped me on the shoulder to say that another bomb had gone off in the crowded basement of the Tavern in the Town pub.It was there that I took a flash picture of Birmingham fireman Ralph Dawes with a young lad in shirtsleeves who were carrying bodies in red canvas sheets.I saw many people fleeing in all directions from the devastation caused by the bombs, which exploded within two minutes of each other. There was a young lady in a bloodstained dress sitting stunned on a kerbstone outside the Odeon Cinema.At the entrance of the cinema a number 90 Birmingham Corporation bus with a destination blind showing Pheasey Estate Great Barr who had just stopped to pick up passengers. The extreme force of the blast caused all the windows of the bus to be blown out injuring many people.There wasn't a shop window in New Street leading from the Rotunda to Corporation Street which wasn't affected. I recall vividly the numerous burglar alarms which were set off and the flashing blue emergency lights of the convoy of fire engines and ambulances.At one stage the ambulances were stuck in the congestion. The black cabs came to the rescue by ferrying some of the injured to the General Hospital in Steelhouse Lane.For two hours I continued to take pictures of the horrible unfolding events. Time was getting late and I needed to get my films back to the office. So I decided to make my way on foot to Digbeth Coach Station to hire a cab. Normally I would have processed my films at the Birmingham Post and Mail and wired the prints to Fleet Street. However the National Union of Journalists were on strike. Taxis were hard to hire, however, I managed to persuaded a driver to deliver my films direct to Fleet Street.Six pictures were released to all the National newspapers, the provincial press and television newsrooms in the U.K. during the early hours of the following morning. Under the severe circumstances the journalists called off their strike making it possible to bring out an emergency edition of the Birmingham Evening Mail.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack blown <extra_id_0> Attacker James McDade <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Coventry Telephone Exchange <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Little Park Street <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime searching <extra_id_0> Investigator police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place terminals <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack gone off <extra_id_0> Target Tavern in the Town <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

Marathon, killing three spectators and injuring hundreds.The court also ruled to set aside three of his 30 convictions but said he will remain in federal prison for the rest of his life.The court ruled Tsarnaev should be given a new penalty phase trial, where a new set of jurors can again decide if he should be sentenced to death.Tsarnaev, now 27, will remain incarcerated and is being held at the nation's most secure federal prison in Florence, Colorado.\"And just to be crystal clear: Because we are affirming the convictions (excluding the three ... convictions) and the many life sentences imposed on those remaining counts (which Dzhokhar has not challenged), Dzhokhar will remain confined to prison for the rest of his life, with the only question remaining being whether the government will end his life by executing him,\" the opinion, authored by Circuit Court Judge Ojetta Rogeriee Thompson, says.Tsarnaev was convicted in 2015, including for the deaths of Krystle Campbell Lingzi Lu at the marathon and police officer Sean Collier, separately.Around-the-clock coverageTsarnaev's legal team had pushed to change the venue of the trial to a courthouse that wasn't so close to the site of the bombing, in the heart of a town so affected by the tragedy.The appeals court judges agreed, saying, \"One could not turn on the radio either without hearing something about these stunningly sad events.\"The appeals judges ruled that US District Court Judge George O'Toole, who oversaw Tsarnaev's trial, \"fell short\" of his promise to question jurors thoroughly enough to identify the degree to which they had been exposed to facts of the case through media coverage, \"providing sufficient ground to vacate his death sentences.\"Part of the appeals court's ruling was a decision to reverse three convictions for charges that Tsarnaev was carrying a firearm in connection with his possession of a pressure cooker bomb.The ruling tells the district court to enter judgments of acquittal on those charges, put together a new jury and preside over a new trial that strictly focuses on what penalty Tsarnaev should receive for the counts that are eligible for the death penalty.Tsarnaev's attorneys had filed a post-trial motion for judgments of acquittal on these convictions that the district court judge denied.CNN has reached out to Tsarnaev's legal team for comment on the ruling.The ruling also states that the judges make no judgment about whether Boston is a \"proper venue\" for a sentencing retrial, and says it is a decision that should be left to the US District Court for Massachusetts, where the initial trial was held.The US Attorney's office said: \"We are currently reviewing the opinion and are declining further comment at this time.\"Tsarnaev was 19 years old when he and his brother, Tamerlan, who was 26 years old at the time, went to Boston's Boylston Street shortly before 3 p.m. on April 15, 2013, to carry out their plotSurveillance video showed the brothers carrying the pressure cooker bombs in backpacks and moving through the crowd near the marathon finish line in what federal prosecutors called a coordinated attack.Tamerlan set off the first bomb, a 6-quart pressure cooker that contained gunpowder, nails and BBs, prosecutors said.The bomb killed Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager, and permanently injured several other people who lost their legs.The second pressure cooker bomb, carried in by Dzhokhar, went off 12 seconds later and killed two people, Martin and Lu, a graduate student from China.The bombings sparked a manhunt for days that shut down the city and resulted in wall-to-wall coverage of the search.The brothers, while on the run, killed Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier.After they stole an SUV, the two were chased by police.Tamerlan died in an explosive firefight with police in nearby Watertown.Dzhokhar was arrested a day later.Victims, families to relive another trialThe decision to order a new trial will be difficult for the families of victims, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said after the decision came down on Friday.\"I think the concern that some families have had from the very beginning was that this day was going to come, where they would have to relive another trial, and you know they shouldn't have to relive another trial,\" Walsh said.\"The only thing that I'll say is a positive ... this guy will never see the light of day again.He's going to live within those four walls.He got exactly what he deserved.\"Shortly after Tsarnaev was found guilty on all counts, the parents of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was killed in the bombing, publicly pleaded for prosecutors not to pursue the death sentence in the penalty phase of the trial.\"We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring,\" the parents wrote in a column in The Boston Globe.\"As long as the defendant is in the spotlight, we have no choice but to live a story told on his terms, not ours.The minute the defendant fades from our newspapers and TV screens is the minute we begin the process of rebuilding our lives and our family.\"CNN has reached out to the Richard family for comment on Friday's ruling.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentence

{"text": "Indonesian Police Receive Terrorist Threat Targeting BaliJAKARTA \u2014\u00a0In Indonesia there are growing concerns that more deadly attacks could follow last week\u2019 bombings in Jakarta by Islamist militants.Bali police Tuesday say they received an anonymous letter warning that the resort Island will be the next target for a terrorist assault.\"The letter was sent by an anonymous individual to Buleleng district, and the police are still conducting an investigation, and trying to find out who sent the letter. But again, I urge people in Bali not to be afraid, but they should stay alert,\" said Bali Police Chief Sugeng Priyanto.Authorities say they've increased security at shopping malls and other locations that draw crowds in Bali.In 2002, the popular resort island was targeted by Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), an Indonesia-based terrorist group with links to al-Qaida. The bombing of a club in Bali killed 202 people, mostly foreigners.The Bali bombing severely hurt Indonesia\u2019s tourism industry, and began a decade of deadly plots in Indonesia carried out by Southeast Asian militants affiliated with al-Qaida.Indonesia successfully combated the JI related terrorist threat through police action, intelligence operations and high profile criminal prosecutions.However, after last week's attack in the center of Jakarta that killed eight people, including four militants, Indonesian security forces are raising concerns that more and deadlier attacks could follow, carried out by groups inspired by Islamic State.Indonesian Special Police patrol at Ngurah Rai Airport in Denpasar on Indonesia's resort island of Bali on Jan. 15, 2016, one day after a series of explosions hit the Indonesian capital Jakarta.The Jakarta attack was the first of its kind in Southeast Asia to be attributed to Syria-based militant Islamists.Authorities say about 500 Indonesians have travelled to the Middle East to join the extremist group. About 100 are believed to have returned, although experts say only about 15 have combat experience.Jakarta back to normalSo far the renewed threat of terrorism has not instilled any widespread sense of panic or fear amongst Indonesians.A security personnel stand guard inside train carriage for women at Manggarai train station in Jakarta, Jan. 8, 2016.Life in Jakarta has quickly returned to normal, less than a week after the deadly attacks.On Tuesday the Starbucks coffee shop that was bombed remained closed and boarded up for repairs, but the memorial of flowers had been removed. Other shops have reopened and traffic at the busy intersection was congested as usual.'Ojek' heroThe \u201cojek\u201d motorcycle taxi drivers were again gathered at the intersection where the attack took place, waiting for their next fares.One of the \u201cojek\u201d drivers back at work is Muhamad Yunus, who has received widespread praise for the selfless courage he exhibited during the attack.The militant attackers last Thursday (January 14) set off two bombs, the first at the Starbucks and the second at a police traffic station in the middle of the intersection, near Jakarta's oldest department store, Sarinah.After the second explosion Yunus rushed to the police station to help the wounded even though the assailants were shooting at anyone in the area. He said he found a woman whose legs were severely injured and brought her to safety, away from the firefight.\u201cI got that woman and I told her, don\u2019t cry. Please be strong. Be strong. Please don\u2019t be sad,\u201d Yunus said.Yunus said he found out later that the woman and her nephew were stopped by the police for a traffic violation at the time of the blast. Her nephew died in the explosion.Kami tidak takutAfter the Jakarta attack there have been demonstrations by Indonesian Muslims to denounce terrorism and call for the government to eradicate radical militants and supporters of Islamic State in the country.A \"Pray for Jakarta\" message (top) is displayed on a screen as Indonesians gather outside the damaged Starbucks coffee shop in central Jakarta on Jan. 17, 2016 following the deadly gun and bomb attacks that rocked the city on Jan. 14.Indonesians also have started to use hashtags like \"PrayforJakarta\" and \"Kamitidaktakut\" or \"Wearenotafraid\" in English, on social media.Yunus\u2019s act of heroism has been held up as an example of Indonesia\u2019s resolve to stand up against terrorism.\u201cI am not afraid. We won\u2019t be scared any more,\u201d he said.Dismantling terror networksMeanwhile Indonesian authorities have promised to intensify their efforts to monitor radical networks in the country.Police believe the alleged mastermind of the Jakarta attack, an Indonesian fighting with Islamic State in Syria called Bahrun Naim, used social media to communicate his radical ideas to followers in Indonesia.In December police say they successfully disrupted plans by militants to launch a string of deadly attacks on Christmas and New Year celebrations, as well as against the country's Shia Muslim minority.Prior to last week, the last major attack in the world's most populous Muslim nation was the twin bombing of luxury hotels in Jakarta in 2009.Ade Irma in Jakarta contributed to this

{"text": "CNN interviews man claiming to be Maduro assassination attempt organizerImage: CNNIn this frame from CNN footage aired on March 14, a DJI Matrice M600 Pro equipped with the A3 Pro positioning system (the white discs), apparently the same model used in the attack in Caracas last August.Cable News Network (CNN), the American news outlet, has published a report with video following an interview with a man claiming to be the organizer of the August 4 assassination attempt in Caracas on Venezuela\u2019s president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, using two drones.Seven people were injured in the two explosions.A number of arrests were made following the attack, but it is unclear if the suspects had anything to do with the incident.The man, whose identity was not revealed, provided CNN with cellphone footage said to be from a rented farm at a remote site in Columbia.The videos show men unboxing and assembling two D\u00e0-Ji\u0101ng Innovations (DJI) Matrice M600 Pro c-drones on a billiards table.Scenes purporting to show an explosive charge mounted underneath one of the drones and a DJI flight controller were partially blurred by CNN editors.Video footage said to be taken on the grounds of the farmhouse show two DJI Phantom quadcopter drones being flown simultaneously in what was described as practice piloting.CNN did not specify that the Phantom quadcopters shown in the practice runs differ from the larger M600 Pro hexacopters shown being prepared for the attack.The man interviewed claimed that following the assassination attempt, he met with US officials on three occasions to answer their questions and solicit assistance, which he said was not forthcoming.The footage shows clearly that both of the M600 Pro drones are equipped with DJI\u2019s A3 Pro positioning system, a set of three redundant GPS units and controllers meant to provide more precise and reliable positioning than the stock single A3 system delivered on the original M600 model.The C-Drone Review had identified such a three-sensor system on one of the M600 drones which exploded in August from analysis of Telemundo footage.Although CNN in their report said the drones used in the attack were \"small\", the M600 Pro model is an industrial-grade hexacopter c-drone with a payload of 13lb (6kg) and is larger than the Phantom models shown flying in the footage.Video from last August in Caracas shows that the landing struts of the M600 Pros had been removed, lightening the drones for their one-way trips.The M600 Pro folds to a smaller size than the original M600; CNN said in their report they were told that the drones used in the attack were dismantled, taken over the border from Columbia to Venezuela, and reassembled there.Contacted, DJI could not definitively confirm that some of its drones appear in the footage aired by CNN, although that appears to be the case.A spokesman for DJI, Adam Lisberg, sent the following statement to the C-Drone Review:DJI makes drones entirely for peaceful purposes, and we absolutely deplore any attempt to use our drones to cause harm.We build safety features into our products to help drone pilots avoid flying in restricted areas, and we developed our AeroScope system to allow authorities to remotely identify and track airborne drones.We have little ability to control what people do with our products after purchase, but anyone who deliberately misuses our products should expect to be held responsible for their actions.Venezuela is in crisis, with widespread shortages of staple foodstuffs and medical supplies, rolling power outages, and thousands of inhabitants leaving the country every day.President Maduro has accused Columbia and the United States of conspiring against him, without proof.The US withdrew its last embassy personnel from Venezuela last week, as opposition politician Juan Guaid\u00f3 seeks to oust Maduro from power.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Contact interviews <extra_id_0> Participant man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact aired <extra_id_0> Communicator CNN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble equipped <extra_id_0> Artifact Matrice M600 Pro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components A3 Pro positioning system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact published <extra_id_0> Communicator CNN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact interview <extra_id_0> Participant man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosions  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble assembling <extra_id_0> Components Matrice M600 Pro c-drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble mounted <extra_id_0> Artifact drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components explosive charge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle dismantled <extra_id_0> Artifact the drones used in the attack <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble reassembled <extra_id_0> Artifact the drones used in the attack <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact met <extra_id_0> Participant officials <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flown <extra_id_0> Vehicle Phantom quadcopter drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassination <extra_id_0> Attacker man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Nicol\u00e1s Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrests <extra_id_0> Detainee suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize identified <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject three-sensor system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Defendant Columbia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation withdrew <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact personnel <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize claimed <extra_id_0> Identifier The man interviewed <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "British Security Services Questioned About Surveillance PrioritiesLONDON \u2014\u00a0For the second time in a month Britain\u2019s security services are facing awkward questions about their surveillance policies, after it emerged the ringleader of Saturday\u2019s terror attack in the heart of London was known to them and had been interrogated in the past.The British-Pakistani, who police are not naming for operational reasons, was also a recognized Islamic State follower in the streets around his home in the east London district of Barking, where he tried to recruit children and proselytized openly in a nearby park, sparking a complaint to the police by a local resident.The 27-year-old, father of at least two young children, appeared also in a television documentary last year in which he was pictured unfurling an Islamic State banner and later arguing with police during a London protest organized by radical preacher Anjem Choudary, a convicted IS recruiter.Last month, community and mosque leaders in Manchester and neighbors of Salman Abedi, the British-Libyan who carried out the May 22 concert bombing in the city, accused the security services of missing several opportunities to identify him as a high-risk militant.FILE - A police officer stands outside Didsbury mosque in Manchester, Britain, May 24, 2017.At least five times locals warned the police of their fears about the 22-year-old suicide bomber. One community worker said he contacted authorities after Abedi said being a suicide bomber was OK.Insufficient responseNeither Britain\u2019s domestic intelligence service MI5 nor the Manchester police responded to the claims, but lawmakers have demanded to know why Abedi was seen just as a peripheral figure and one not requiring surveillance and investigation.FILE - Salman Abedi, the bomber behind the Manchester suicide bombing, is seen in this image taken from CCTV on the night he committed the attack in this handout photo released, May 27, 2017, from the Greater Manchester Police.Similar questions are being prompted again in the wake of the van-and-knife attack in the London Bridge district of Britain\u2019s capital. Erica Gasparri, a mother of three who lived in Barking told local media she had reported Abedi two years ago, after he approached kids in a local park. She says she confronted him after her two children came home and said, \u201cMummy I want to become a Muslim.\u201dThe parents of the ringleader of Saturday\u2019s attack are reported to have been asylum seekers from Pakistan. According to local media, the man, nicknamed Abz, worked at various times for a fast-food outlet, a clothing store and subsequently for the London Underground system.FILE - Police attend to an incident on London Bridge in London, Britain, June 3, 2017.A onetime friend of the ringleader also told the BBC that he warned police, alerting them to comments made about previous terrorist attacks in Britain and of his alarm at the man's increasingly extremist beliefs. The friend said the alleged attacker was a keen follower of American radical preacher Ahmad Musa Jibril and would watch YouTube videos of the cleric.\u201cHe used to listen to a lot of Musa Jibril,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cI phoned the anti-terror hotline. I spoke to the gentleman. I told him about our conversation and why I think he was radicalized ... I did my bit, I know a lot of other people did their bit, but the authorities did not do their bit,\u201d he added.Security strategy reviewA senior Conservative official told VOA that there is deep frustration in Downing Street about Saturday\u2019s attack and the fact that at least one of the assailants was known to the authorities.Prime Minister Theresa May promised to review Britain\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy, holding out the prospects of enhanced powers for the security services and longer jail sentences for extremists. She said she wants to take a tougher line with internet providers and social media businesses that allow extremist material on their sites.WATCH: British Prime Minister Theresa MayVideo sizewidthxheightpixelsBritain PM May: 'Enough is Enough'Share this video0:00:30\u25b60:00:00/0:00:30\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 1.5MB360p | 1.8MB480p | 10.5MBAmong the measures being recommended by security chiefs, according to government officials, is the power to require those on terror watch lists to wear electronic tags, a ban on the sale of unregistered SIM cards, and a ban on immediate vehicle rentals, requiring renters to wait two hours and for rental firms to run checks on them with the police.Police and counter-terror officers launched further raids early Monday in east London. A police spokesman said \u201ca number\u201d of people had been detained. Local residents reported hearing bangs and gunshots during the raids. On Sunday, police arrested 12 people, seven women and five men in connection with Saturday\u2019s terror attack.

With all the nationalized \u201cbasic industries\u201d around here, they\u2019re a normal part of daily life. So I called around some of the ones I know to ask about today\u2019s vote. The stories I heard were\u2026 remarkably similar.Jos\u00e9 at FerromineraAt Ferrominera, the big mining company in Guayana, workers are being forced to vote for the Constituent Assembly. The deal is simple: vote or you\u2019re fired. At each department, the manager is responsible for making sure his people vote.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get fired,\u201d he says. \u201cMy daughter is in the hospital.\u201dThere\u2019s nothing subtle about it. The order comes face-to-face, in notices and even via text message. Employees must go to meetings where the order is to vote. Nobody cares who they vote for \u2014this is a single party election, man. Managers are required to make lists with the ID numbers of the employees voting, and send them to human resources by Monday.Jos\u00e9 \u2014not his real name\u2014 has worked at Ferrominera for 15 years. \u201cThey make everyone vote, especially those in higher positions.\u201dJos\u00e9 isn\u2019t voting, though. He\u2019s not wealthy and he doesn\u2019t have a plan B if they fire him, but he\u2019s taking the chance.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get fired,\u201d he says. \u201cMy daughter is in the hospital, I guess my wife and I will go with her. I don\u2019t know.\u201dIn his office, where barely ten people work, everyone has agreed to boycott the election. But, he adds, many others are compelled out of fear.Maria\u2019s mom at PDVSAMartha \u2014like all names, changed for this story\u2014 wouldn\u2019t talk to me. I had to approach her daughter Mar\u00eda instead. She talked to me in secret, without telling her mom. \u201cI know her, there\u2019s no way she\u2019ll agree to an interview. She\u2019s too scared\u201d.She must report to her boss the exact voting center she went to, and the time she went at.Martha didn\u2019t go to the vote drill. Her boss harassed her and the other employees with constant texts, but there was only one voting center in Ciudad Guayana, and it was too far to consider it.For the real thing, the pressure is absurd. She must report to her boss the exact voting center she went to, and the time she went at. Martha will try a null vote. She\u2019s been in PDVSA for more than 20 years.Betania\u2019s dad at VenalumBetania\u2019s dad wouldn\u2019t talk to me (see a pattern?), but his daughter, an old friend, told me what he told the family. Her dad has been working for the big aluminum-maker way before chavismo was a thing: 25 years total.I just wish they burn all of the voting machines, so no one can vote. I hate this fucking government with all my soul.On Sunday, workers are being told to go to the plant first thing. They\u2019ll be put on buses to the voting centers. Managers are responsible for making sure the workers participate, and have lists saying where each worker votes. They must show up in the company\u2019s uniform too \u2014for the picture.Betania\u2019s dad is determined to vote. He has to protect his job; he\u2019s about to retire, he won\u2019t risk it. His family thinks he should stay home today. \u201cHere, they\u2019ll block the road at 5 am\u201d Betania tells me, \u201cso he might not be able to leave. We want him to stay, something might happen on the way there.\u201dShe catches her thoughts.\u201cI just wish they burn all of the voting machines, so no one can vote. I hate this fucking government with all my soul.\u201dJorge in the ArmyMilitary officers are forced to vote, just like any other state worker. As soldiers, they have to follow orders, or face trial by insubordination.I wish I could reveal more about my guy, but he wouldn\u2019t let me. He\u2019s a military officer and it\u2019s from el interior. He doesn\u2019t want to vote, and his plan is to show up, say hi and walk out. By showing himself, he thinks, he\u2019ll be off the hook.I reached out to people at two other state companies, but they refused to talk, even after I offered to change their names. The fear of dismissal makes getting the stories extremely hard, and look at the pattern I discovered: threats are explicit, demands are crystal clear and the workers? Extremely resentful of the position they\u2019ve been put in.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle burn <extra_id_0> Artifact machines <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destroyer they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle burn <extra_id_0> Artifact machines <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destroyer they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact called <extra_id_0> Participant some <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand forced <extra_id_0> Recipient workers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Guayana <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand making sure <extra_id_0> Recipient his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator manager <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand order  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand order <extra_id_0> Recipient Employees <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand required <extra_id_0> Recipient Managers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand make <extra_id_0> Communicator They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient everyone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce compelled <extra_id_0> Recipient others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact approach <extra_id_0> Participant Mar\u00eda <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact talked <extra_id_0> Participant me <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact report <extra_id_0> Participant her <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic voting center <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce harassed <extra_id_0> Communicator Her <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient employees <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact report <extra_id_0> Participant her <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic voting center <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant family <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant me <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand told <extra_id_0> Recipient workers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation put <extra_id_0> Vehicle buses <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination centers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact They <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand making sure <extra_id_0> Communicator Managers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient workers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce forced <extra_id_0> Recipient officers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce orders <extra_id_0> Recipient they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reached out <extra_id_0> Participant I <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> EndPosition fire <extra_id_0> Employee him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

Yes that's right you know if you look back a year ago the first bomb actually went off on March 2 but we did not know this was a serial bomber.

That's the place you're putting a bomb on a plane as a V didn't want to admitted at the time because he'd want to cause a panic but they saw packages ready for shipping day had a hunch and the fear that his next step would be to put it into the shipping system at the end it was exactly that it.

{"text": "It\u2019s possible that targeted killings will be the only policy of president Barack Obama that the new resident of the White House will be eager to perpetuate.Last May, President Donald Trump stated, \u201cI have to do what\u2019s right \u2026 as far as drones are concerned \u2026 to take out terrorists\u201d. He kept his word: US drones apparently killed three alleged Al Qaeda members in Yemen in late January.Targeted killing \u2013 the killing of specific individuals usually performed by drones \u2013 is a globally expanding practice.It blends police objectives with military operations. Targets are considered to be enemy combatants. But if they were to be apprehended in the country where they plan to perpetrate their attack they would not be killed, they would be arrested and put on trial.Targeted killings are a both a domestic issue and an international one and they combine resources gathered from intelligence means and military power. They are one of the constitutive elements of the preventive use of force framework that emerged in the early 2000s.Killing by droneTargeted killings were introduced by Israel just after the start of the second intifada in 2000; the idea came from the Israeli internal security agency, Shin Bet. Israel is unapologetic about these assassinations and ample information about the killings is available.The issue has been brought to the Supreme Court, which has repelled the accusation of illegality of the operations. It has also defined a set of restrictive criteria in order to regulate their use.Back then, Israel was criticised severely by the US, but that was two weeks before 9/11. Once the US was hit, the Bush administration started its own global program of targeted killings in the context of what became the doctrinal setting of the so-called \u201cwar on terror\u201d.The global war on terror has often stirred criticism in France, both in civil society circles and in government. This should not come as a surprise since it is hard, if not impossible, to convince third parties that US law should authorise the violation of state sovereignty and that such unilateralism apply to the use of force.Today, the UK has a programme of its own and France is also on board. French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has set a \u201ckill list\u201d of jihadists who, his advisors believe, are a threat to French citizens. France, we knew, killed a jihadist in October 2015, but we now have information that this is not an isolated case.What we see today is the versatility of democracies and their selfishness. When leaders believe national security is not at risk, a discourse inspired by human rights prevails. When leaders believe there are security problems, especially if the lives of their civilians are at risk on their own soil, rights are not a primary concern. When abiding by principles is costly, they are put aside.This is the old \u201cbalancing\u201d debate: the security versus rights dilemma. In theory it is a sophisticated one, the practice is less nuanced.Prime Minister Manuel Valls\u2019s response to journalists who asked him if those operations were legal was telling. With a mix of candour, foolishness and arrogance, he responded that they ought not to ask questions that \u201care making things too complicated\u201d.A global problemSo far, the US program of targeted elimination is the most problematic. It can be argued that Israel is in conflict with Palestine and therefore the use of force is permissible in certain areas of the Palestinian territories, as, in times of war and during conflicts, the killing of combatant by other combatants is legal and legitimate. This does not mean that Israeli targeted killings program is immune to criticism and that what has become a routine is justifiable.But the US program authorises the US to kill its targets in countries it is not at war with or in the absence of conflict, in some cases these are even allies, such as Pakistan where, for obvious reasons, they create great resentment.The area covered by the US program is huge and the number of operations very significant. Unlike in the case of Israel, no official data is available (especially concerning the number of civilians who die because of the attacks). The targets\u2019 selection is also problematic, especially in the case of \u201csignature strikes\u201d \u2013 those targets that are selected on a statistical basis.The decision to strike depends on the signals that individuals display and which make them look suspicious. A young male dressed in clothes that cover his face, and taking a stroll at night in a Pakistani area where rebels are known to live has good reasons to fear for his security.As the US will pursue if not expand its targeted killings policy, we need to be aware of the problems inherent to this practice. They are legally dubious. They create political tensions between those who use them and those states where they are operating.Finally, their efficacy has not been proven. Even, in the Israeli case, some, very convincingly, challenge that targeted killings are the cause of the decrease of suicide bombers.Who\u2019s next, what\u2019s next?Other liberal countries are jumping on the bandwagon, such as the US\u2019s gentle neighbour Canada. But the next step is even more intriguing.For now, we see a clear North-South divide: Western states are shooting while the Middle East, Africa and Muslim areas are taking the bullets. But this might change.What will happen when Russia, Turkey and China launch their own operations? This will mark the end of Western exceptionalism.In Israel and in the US, democracies are engaged in vivid legal debates on the legality of the operations they carry out.The outcome of this endeavour has been to try to define domestic laws that would allow the use of force at the international level, which is already contrary to the spirit of international law (if not its content). At the international level, we saw some attempts to address this issue at the UN, but, so far, the results of these efforts have been mitigated.What happens when non-democracies where human rights and international humanitarian laws, to say the least, are not a priority, use drones or other devices to perform targeted killings? It is probable that because they care less and have fewer resources and expertise than the US, their operations will be less precise?Is their power likely to be contained? It is unlikely that the US and Western states will be able to push in this direction. After all, they initiated the process. In this regard, the recent confrontation over Syria between US ambassador Samantha Power and the Russian representative Vitaly Churkin at the UN in December 2016 is very telling about the general situation we are in.Power repeatedly and emphatically asked the Russians if they felt no \u201cshame\u201d, because of the heavy bombings they carried out in order to rescue and resuscitate the Assad regime. In return, Churkin mocked Power by bluntly emphasising that she built \u201cher statement as if she was Mother Teresa\u201d. He told her to remember of her \u201cown country track record\u201d, instead of trying to display such unwarranted \u201cmoral supremacy\u201d.We have to envisage the future consequences of the expansion of targeted killings as a norm and be aware of the dangers of their spread. It will be more difficult for those who want to occupy the moral high ground or simply to limit the use of force to denounce the absurdity of this situation. Western elites in government and outside, by that time, will have already made too many concessions with the principles they want others to uphold.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim members <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Yemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer US <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Killer France <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim jihadist <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Third Friend of Accused Boston Bomber IndictedBOSTON \u2014\u00a0A third college friend of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was indicted on charges he lied to federal investigators, the U.S. Attorney General for Massachusetts said in a statement on Thursday.Robel Phillipos, 19, was one of the three people who removed a backpack full of fireworks and a laptop from Tsarnaev's dormitory room at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth days after the April 15 attack, and later lied about it, prosecutors claim.The two other students, Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov \u2014 both from Kazakhstan \u2014 have already been indicted on obstruction charges and detained pending trial. They have pleaded not guilty.Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan, ethnic Chechens, are believed to have set off a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the world-renowned marathon's finish line, killing three people and maiming scores of others in one of the worst attacks on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001.Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police a few days after the bombing. Dzhokhar was captured and imprisoned pending trial on terrorism charges.According to the indictment against Phillipos, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sent a text message to Kadyrbayev on April 18, shortly after the FBI published pictures of the bombing suspects, asking his friend to go to his \u201croom and take what's there.\u201dThe three men allegedly took the laptop, backpack and other items from Tsarnaev's room later that day and put them in a dumpster in nearby New Bedford. Investigators later recovered the items from a landfill, according to the indictment.Phillipos, along with Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov, concealed his actions during interviews with federal investigators between April 19 and April 25, according to the indictment.\u201cIn so doing, he made numerous false and misleading statements to the agents,\u201d according to the statement from the office of U.S. Attorney General for Massachusetts Carmen Ortiz.Phillipos, who has been under house arrest since May, faces up to 16 years in prison if convicted. Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov face up to 25 years in jail or deportation.Next year's Boston Marathon will include an additional 9,000 runners, boosting the field size to 36,000, amid a groundswell of support and interest in the wake of the bombing attack, the marathon's organizers said on Thursday.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack set off <extra_id_0> Attacker Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target line <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize recovered <extra_id_0> Identifier Investigators <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place landfill <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict indicted <extra_id_0> Defendant Dias Kadyrbayev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime removed <extra_id_0> Place room <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Perpetrator Robel Phillipos <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict indicted <extra_id_0> Defendant friend <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain imprisoned <extra_id_0> Detainee Dzhokhar <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime lied <extra_id_0> Perpetrator Robel Phillipos <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Thai Police Arrest Bombing SuspectBANGKOK \u2014\u00a0Police in Thailand arrested a suspect Saturday in connection with the bombing earlier this month that killed 20 people.The man, described as a foreigner, was being charged with possessing explosives and was in military custody, authorities told reporters.The suspect was also found with ball bearings, fuses, pipes and other bomb-making materials, as well as a stack of Turkish passports, police and army officials said.All Thai television channels carried a brief broadcast by the Thai military junta at 6 p.m. Saturday announcing the arrest.National police chief General Somyot Poompanmoung speaks to reporters outside the compound where police detained a suspect in the August 17 Bangkok shrine bombing, in a Bangkok suburb on Aug. 29, 2015.It was the first big breakthrough since the August 17 blast at the popular Erawan Hindu Shrine in central Bangkok killed 20 people \u2014 Thais, Chinese, Malaysians, a Singaporean and an Indonesian \u2014 and wounding more than 100 people of numerous nationalities.The bombing was the worst single mass casualty attack in Thailand.It was followed a day later by an explosion in the Chao Praya river adjacent to the Sathorn pier, about five kilometers away from the shrine. No one was injured in that detonation.Authorities believe a separate man on the King Taksin Bridge, around the time of the shrine blast, had dropped a time bomb into the river.The military junta\u2019s announcement came hours after a \u201cforeign man,\u201d said to be 28 years of age, was taken into custody on the eastern fringe of Bangkok.A police source said the arrest of the suspect, who is believed to be Turkish, came after investigators sifting through records of mobile phone calls identified three Turkish numbers, which had been activated by international roaming services near the blast site, according to the Sunday edition of the Bangkok Post. Earlier, authorities had told reporters that a tip from a landlord had led them to the suspect whose apartment building was surrounded by more than 100 police and soldiers on Saturday. Thai police stand on the balcony outside of an apartment building in Nong Jok on the outskirts of Bangkok, Aug. 29, 2015. Thai police say they arrested a suspect in the blast at the Erawan Shrine in this apartment building.The bomb-making materials found at the apartment were similar to those used at the Erawan Hindu Shrine and were linked to the second explosion as well.The suspect's identity remained unclear, but \"we found he's connected to both Bangkok blasts,\" said national police spokesman Prawut Thavornsiri. \"We believe the perpetrators are from the same group.\u201dThe Thai national police chief told reporters Saturday evening that the attacks were \u201cnot an international terrorist act.\u201dA handout photo from the Royal Thai police and released on August 29, 2015 shows the suspect which is being detained at a police station in Bangkok.The motive by the main culprit was instead \"taking personal revenge for his comrades,\u201d asserted Police General Somyot Pumpanmuang, without elaborating on how authorities had quickly reached that conclusion.The suspect was being questioned late Saturday in the presence of officials of the Turkish Embassy, local media reported.Police released a copy of the photo page of one of the Turkish passports with the arrested man\u2019s photo. It was quickly alleged on social media that the passport was a crude forgery with two dates of expiry and several misspellings in Turkish.A search was underway for more than 10 additional suspects, some of whom were already believed to have left the kingdom, police said, but they had been ruled out as being part of a wider international terrorist network.The Thai police have come under criticism for their investigation, in which they had released contradictory information about possible suspects in the bombing.The prime suspect was captured on closed circuit television \u2014 a man in a yellow T-shirt who left a bag at the shrine just before the explosion.This Aug. 17, 2015, image, released by Royal Thai Police spokesman Lt.

{"text": "An IRA member who was part of the group behind the Birmingham pub bombings has apologised.Michael Christopher Hayes \u2013 a self-confessed bomb maker \u2013 said he was sorry for the killing of innocent people in the 1974 blasts.Speaking to the BBC, Mr Hayes said he hoped his apology on behalf of all active republicans will help grieving relatives find \"closure\".He said: \"My apologies and my heartfelt sympathies to all of you, for the terrible, tragic loss that you've been put through. And all these years you've been trying to find closure. I hope at last God will be merciful and bring you closure.\"And I apologise not only for myself ... I apologise for all active republicans who had no intention of hurting anybody and sympathise with you.\"An eight-minute delay before police were warned of the bombs' location led to the death of 21 people and the injury of 182 others, when they exploded in a pair of city centre pubs. Mr Hayes said the bombs had not been intended to kill people.On the evening of the 21 November 1974, a man with an Irish accent called the Birmingham Post and Evening Mail newspapers to say two bombs were planted in the town centre.He finished the call by giving the official code used by the Provisional IRA to authenticate a warning call and allow civilians to be evacuated.Former IRA officials have since said there was an unintentional delay in issuing the warning.Mr Hayes said the IRA unit in Birmingham had been shocked by the death toll.\"That wasn't meant. It wouldn't have been done if that was the case,\" he said.The wreckage left at the Mulberry Bush pub in Birmingham after a bomb exploded on 21 November 1974 (PA)The Birmingham pub bombings caused the worst single losses of life in the Troubles. Six men were wrongfully convicted for the blasts but no-one has ever been brought to justice.Mr Hayes, 69, who now lives in south Dublin, said he personally defused a third bomb on Birmingham's Hagley Road after he became aware of the death toll in the first two blasts.He refused to say who planted the bombs in the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town but he said he wanted to speak out to give \"the point of view of a participant\".But relatives of those who were killed said the apology was \"gutless and spineless\".Mr Hayes' apology came as an inquest into the bombings was reopened by a coroner stating \"a wealth of evidence\" had not yet been heard.West Midland Police said their investigation remained open but that no further comments on the suspects' identities will be provided until the proceedings have concluded.Victims' families have repeatedly asked for the names of the suspects to be disclosed.Mr Hayes was arrested and questioned by West Midlands Police about the bombings in 1974 but he was released.He said he had been a member of the IRA for more than 30 years in both Ireland and England and had participated in the group's activities in Birmingham as \"an active volunteer\".UK news in pictures Show all 50 1 /50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 18 September 2020 A model presents a creation during the Bora Aksu catwalk show at London Fashion Week 2020 Reuters UK news in pictures 17 September 2020 World kickboxing champion Carl Thomas during his attempt to run a marathon while pulling a plane at Elvington Airfield near York.

{"text": "New York Gov.Andrew Cuomo (D) said Sunday that there is \u201cno evidence of an international terrorism connection\u201d in the explosion in Chelsea, though he stopped short of saying whoever caused the incident did not want to incite terror.AD\u201cIt depends on your definition of terrorism,\u201d Cuomo said.\u201cA bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism, but it\u2019s not linked to international terrorism.In other words, we find no ISIS connections.\u201dADHe said later: \u201cThis is the nightmare scenario.\u201dNot long after the blast, police said they had found another possible explosive device just blocks away.This device appeared to be similar to a pressure cooker and had wiring on it, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation.Pressure cookers were used in the two bombs detonated at the Boston Marathon in 2013.The bomb squad safely removed the second device, New York police tweeted early Sunday.Police officers, firefighters and other first responders had rushed to the scene of the blast, which closed a major roadway and forced people out of nearby buildings.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said Sunday that the explosion was \u201cintentional,\u201d but noted that few details were available because the investigation was in its early stages.\u201cWe know there was a bombing,\u201d de Blasio said.\u201cWe know it was a very serious incident, but we have a lot more work to do to be able to say what kind of motivation was behind this.\u201dADADHe also echoed his comments from Saturday night that there was no specific, credible threat against New York from any terrorist group.The FBI and NYPD are trying to understand what motivation lay behind the blast.\u201cWe will look at individuals.We will look at associations.We will look at social media,\u201d William Sweeney, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI New York Field Office, said.\u201cUntil we have that information it is not fair for us to give a conclusion [as to motivation],\u201d DeBlasio said.\u201cLet the law enforcement experts draw the conclusions.\u201dPolice Commissioner James O\u2019Neill, whose first day in the position was Saturday, told reporters on Sunday that police were still gathering evidence.AD\u201cWe did find some components indicative of an IED\u2026 that went off intentionally,\u201d O\u2019Neill said.Late Saturday, police had ruled out natural gas as a possible cause of the blast.ADThe New York Police Department\u2019s counterterrorism bureau responded to the explosion, along with officials with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.While O\u2019Neill said authorities were still trying to determine what, precisely, exploded, the NYPD counterterrorism bureau posted a photo online earlier Saturday showing what appeared to be a dumpster or garbage container mangled by a blast:Police in New York also reported shortly after 11 p.m. that they had found the \u201cpossible secondary device\u201d a few blocks away from the Chelsea explosion scene, on 27th Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues.Police directed people away from that intersection, and one officer could be heard telling pedestrians that \u201cthere is a possible explosive\u201d in the area.ADNot long after midnight, police said in a statement that they were asking people in the area of this potential explosive to move away from their windows \u201cuntil we clear the suspicious package,\u201d although officers did not fully evacuate the area.ADAccording to the Associated Press, the second device was removed with a robot and taken to the department firing range in the Bronx.O\u2019Neill said Sunday that two \u201cvery dedicated\u201d former New York state troopers had responded to the initial report of the blast last night.In a search for other explosives, they had parked their vehicle on 27th Street.Walking down the block, they found the second, unexploded device, O\u2019Neill said.ADReports of another suspicious package at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue turned out to be a false alarm \u2014 the package was only garbage, J. Peter Donald, a police spokesman, posted on Twitter around 12:30 a.m. Sunday.The Chelsea explosion occurred about 11 hours after a pipe bomb exploded in a Jersey Shore garbage can, shortly before a scheduled charity 5K race there benefiting Marines and Navy sailors.ADAuthorities have said they have not yet found anything connecting the Chelsea and New Jersey incidents but are continuing to investigate.On Sunday, Cuomo said the \u201cbombs\u201d in Chelsea \u201cappear to be different\u201d from those discovered earlier in the day in New Jersey, though the devices from both states were being shipped to the FBI lab in Quantico for further assessment.He said the devices in New Jersey were \u201cpipe bombs,\u201d and those in Chelsea were not.Cuomo said agents in New York were in touch with those in New Jersey.ADCuomo said officials \u201chave no reason to believe at this time that there is any further immediate threat,\u201d though the National Guard and the New York State Police were deploying an additional 1,000 personnel to bus terminals, airports and subways \u201cjust to err on the side of caution.\u201dADCuomo said the blast in Chelsea \u201ccaused significant property damage,\u201d though he a nearby subway station was structurally safe.He said law enforcement would work diligently to identify and locate those responsible.\u201cWhoever placed these bombs, we will find, and they will be brought to justice,\u201d Cuomo said.The explosion in the area of 23rd Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues occurred about 8:30 p.m. police said.Several of those injured were brought to area hospitals, Donald, the police spokesman, posted on Twitter.ADAll victims were treated and released by Sunday morning, Cuomo said.A spokeswoman for Lenox Health Greenwich Village, which treated nine of the victims, said patients were treated for minor injuries that included lacerations to the head and body.Other hospitals declined to provide specifics about the extent of patients\u2019 injuries from the explosion.ADPhotos and accounts posted on social media Saturday night showed large crowds \u2014 as well as a large law enforcement presence \u2014 in the area near where the explosion occurred.Soleil Filomena, 64, was leaving a convenience store at Seventh Avenue and 23rd Street when she heard the explosion.\u201cIt was so loud it just went through my whole body,\u201d she said.\u201cPeople started running up 23rd Street, and I started running with them.\u201dADFilomena said she saw a \u201cbig black cloud in the sky.\u201d After the explosion, she said her \u201cear was ringing for 15 minutes.\u201dWhen Keith Salomon of Delaware felt the explosion, he was having dinner a block and a half from the site of the blast.His chair and table shook, he said, and he saw people being taken away in ambulances.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know what it was and so, at first, we just kept eating,\u201d said Salomon, 52, who was visiting his son in the city.\u201cBut then we realized something was wrong.\u201dOthers did not hear the explosion but saw the aftermath.When Jacob Schulman left his apartment a few blocks away shortly before 9 p.m., he saw people running and screaming.AD\u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going on, but everyone looked so panicked.I started running.too,\u201d said Schulman, 26, who has lived in the neighborhood since 2014.Two blocks from the blast scene, a group of people emerged from a screening of the animated movie \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d and saw the flashing lights.One man who came out of the theater said he could not hear anything and had no idea about the explosion not far from where he was sitting.President Obama was briefed on the situation in New York and will be updated as more information becomes available, a White House official said late Saturday.Speaking in Colorado not long after the explosion, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump quickly commented on the situation before much information was known.\u201cI must tell you that just before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Trump shortly after getting off of his plane.His comments were made before authorities confirmed the nature of the explosion.Late Saturday, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said it was important to \u201cknow the facts\u201d before drawing conclusions about such incidents.Early Sunday, posts on social media from people in New York showed the area of the explosion to be relatively calm and quiet.Authorities had closed large swaths of roads in the area Saturday night.On Sunday, several roads had reopened but there remained a large police presence in the area.The explosion in New York comes as foreign leaders, including many heads of state, are heading to Manhattan for the United Nations General Assembly.Secretary of State John F. Kerry arrived Saturday, while Obama is scheduled to head to the city on Monday.This annual meeting \u2014 held more than two miles from the site of the explosion in Chelsea \u2014 is traditionally a challenging time for New York, as many roads are shut down and the heavy security leads to traffic jams.The FBI still has no determination as to motive, said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.Agents are examining the detonated material from the first device as well as studying the second, which appeared to resemble a pressure cooker.They are also looking at video from security cameras, social media \u2014 \u201call the logical leads,\u201d the official said.The explosion in Chelsea coincided with a separate attack that took place in Minnesota Saturday night, in which a man stabbed eight people in a St.Cloud mall before he was killed by an off-duty police officer.On Sunday, an ISIS-linked news agency claimed the mall attacker was \u201ca soldier of the Islamic State.\u201dAn FBI spokesman said in an emailed statement that the agency had not determined whether the stabbings were related to the bombing in Manhattan the same night.Speaking to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday morning, New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie (R) said there were no known links so far between the incident in New Jersey and those in New York and Minnesota.Authorities urged any witnesses with tips, video or other credible information about the explosion to call 1-800-577-TIPS.Berman and Wang reported from Washington.Renae Merle in New York

{"text": "Manchester Bomber\u2019s Blast Felt on Street Where He Grew UpMANCHESTER, ENGLAND \u2014\u00a0The British-born jihadist behind the worst terror attack in Britain in more than a decade in effect killed and maimed people he\u2019d grown up with \u2014 making the atrocity even more horrifying for Manchester residents still struggling to come to terms with a bombing that killed 22 people and injured 59 others at a concert of American pop star Ariana Grande.As the British government raised the terrorist threat level to \"critical\" \u2014 only the second time authorities have done so \u2014 details began to emerge of the 22-year-old suicide bomber Salman Abedi, his Libyan paternity, and his alleged ties to a well-known recruiter for the Islamic State terror group and other known jihadists.He only recently returned from a three-week trip to Libya, according to family members. British police sources say the trip raises the possibility he may have met with members of the terror group\u2019s affiliate in the North African country to plot the attack and to receive training.Known to police The portrait drawn of the mass killer who packed his improvised explosive device with nails, nuts and bolts to maximize the slaughter, is a mixed one.Some neighbors describe him as a football-obsessed fan of Manchester United and keen enthusiast of computer games.They insist there were no signs the student dropout became radicalized. British security services acknowledged Abedi was known to them \u2014 there are some reports the intelligence service may have tried to persuade him to act as an informant \u2014 but they did not see him as a high risk.Others, though, describe a young man full of rage, who denounced a local mosque leader for his criticism of IS. They say he started to pray openly in the streets.A police officer stands outside Didsbury mosque in Manchester, May 24, 2017.A local imam, Mohammed Saeed, told British newspapers Abedi stopped attending his mosque in 2015 after they argued over IS. \u201cSalman used to come to the mosque occasionally, he wasn\u2019t particularly friendly towards me because he didn\u2019t like my anti-IS sermons. He didn\u2019t like what I was saying and showed me the face of hate. He came to the mosque less and less after that.\u201dSon of Libyan emigresAbedi was born in Manchester in 1994, the third of four children, three boys and one girl. His parents were Libyan emigres who found a home in the northern English city after fleeing the Moammar Gadhafi regime in 1980.His father, Ramadan Abedi, a former security guard at Manchester Airport, returned to Libya in 2011 to join the uprising against the Libyan autocrat. Since Gadhafi\u2019s overthrow his parents spent more time in the North African country than in their home in south Manchester, less than two miles from the scene of Monday\u2019s bombing.Police officers arrive at a residential property on Elsmore Road in Fallowfield, Manchester, on May 24, 2017, as investigations continue into the May 22 terror attack at the Manchester Arena.Libyan emigres in Manchester say the bomber\u2019s father had no time for jihadist ideology. \u201cHe was always very confrontational with jihadi ideology, and this ISIS thing isn\u2019t even jihad, it\u2019s criminality. The family will be devastated,\u201d one told local newspapers.According to the Daily Mirror newspaper, Abedi was a family friend of Raphael Hostey, also known as Abu Qaqa al-Britani, who helped recruit other young Britons for Islamic State via social media until he was killed in a drone strike in Syria last year. British police sources say his ties to Hostey are being probed by counter-terror officials who fear Abedi may have been part of a terror cell, a concern heightened by a trip he made to Libya in the run-up to the bombing.Police also remain skeptical that Abedi could have built the bomb alone because of its sophistication.RadicalizationAbedi attended local schools and then went on to study business and management at nearby Salford University. In a statement, a university spokesman described him as \"completely off the radar. He turned up for lectures for two years and then just stopped coming.\u201dA sign on the front door of a house reads \"Stop Knocking On This Door - We Know Nothing About This Family!!\" is pictured on Elsmore Road in Fallowfield, Manchester, on May 24, 2017.In the last year-and-half both Abedi and his older brother, 23-year-old Ismail, were active on social media sites, praising jihadists. Police arrested Ismail Monday night hours after the blast. He taught Arabic classes at the Didsbury mosque and, according to locals, was reported to police after concerns were raised about what he was teaching.Police are also probing the links between the Abedi brothers and another British-Libyan from Manchester, Abdalraouf Abdallah, who was sentenced to a nine-year-prison term after being convicted of funding terrorism and preparing acts of terrorism.Some analysts argue there were plenty of warning signs about Abedi. In a recent study of young British jihadists for the Henry Jackson Society, a London-based think tank, researcher Emma Webb noted a failure of various agencies and educational institutions to share relevant information about individuals vulnerable to radicalization.She urged police and social services to share \u201crelevant information on vulnerable individuals so the full picture is known across all agencies.\u201d", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Injure maimed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1>

{"text": "Boston Bomber Admits Guilt, Receives Death SentenceConvicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev apologized at his sentencing hearing Wednesday before he was formally sentenced to death for the deadly 2013 attack. The 21-year Chechen immigrant stood in a federal courtroom in Boston and admitted that he and his late older brother, Tamerlan, planted two pressure-cooker bombs that exploded near the finish line of the legendary race on April 15, 2013, killing three people and leaving 264 others injured, including 17 who suffered severed limbs. \"I am sorry for the lives that I've taken, for the suffering that I caused you, for the damage I've done, irreparable damage\" Tsarnaev said in his first public remarks since his arrest. But Judge George O'Toole offered no sympathy for Tsarnaev as he handed down the death sentence, saying no one will remember the kind of person he was before the bombing. \"What will be remembered is that you murdered and maimed innocent people, and that you did it willfully and intentionally,\" said O'Toole.Before making his statement, Tsarnaev sat impassively and listened to three hours of testimony from 24 victims and survivors who told how the bombing had adversely affected their lives. The mother of Krystal Campbell, one of the three people killed in the bombing, lashed out at Tsarnaev, saying \"the choices that you made are despicable and what you did to my daughter is disgusting.\"Many of the survivors questioned and even rejected Tsarnaev's expression of remorse, calling it insincere. But one survivor, Henry Borgard, told reporters after the hearing that he accepted Tsarnaev's apology. \"I was actually really happy that he made the statement,\" said Borgard, who was injured as he was walking home from work that day. \"As I said in my personal impact statement, I have forgiven him. I have come to a place of peace and I genuinely hope that he does as well. For me to hear him say that he's sorry, that is enough for me.\" And the father of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was also killed in the attack along with Campbell and Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, said he and his family have moved on. \"He chose hate. He chose destruction. He chose death,\u201d said Bill Richard. \u201cThis is all on him. We choose love. We choose kindness. We choose peace.\u201dThe jury voted unanimously last month to condemn Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death, just days after convicting him on all 30 charges brought against him -- 17 of which carried the possibility of the death penalty. In addition to the three bombing victims, Tsarnaev was also convicted in the death of Sean Collier, a police officer with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department killed during a shootout with the Tsarnaev brothers three days after the attack.His attorneys argued during the penalty phase of the trial that Dzhokhar was under the strong influence of his radicalized older brother, who was killed in the same shootout that killed MIT police officer Collier.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will likely be sent to a federal prison in Indiana to await execution -- a process that could take years as his lawyers appeal his case through the federal court system.

{"text": "On February 26, 1993, at 12:18 p.m., a small cell of terrorists, with links to a local radical mosque and broader Islamist terror networks, detonated approximately 1,200 pounds of explosives in a rental van in the underground parking garage at the World Trade Center. The explosion created a five-story, 150-feet-wide crater, filled with 4,000 tons of rubble, in the sub-grade levels of the towers and undermined the floor of an adjoining hotel.Hundreds of WTC tenants and visitors were trapped in elevators and on the observation deck, and thousands of others in the towers began to evacuate before first responders reached them. Within minutes, the North Tower lobby filled with thick black smoke. Reports of those trapped in the buildings soon overloaded the city\u2019s 911 system.Local, state, and federal agencies responded to the incident and contributed to what was then the largest coordinated rescue effort in New York City history. Some Port Authority of New York & New Jersey staff with specialized knowledge of the building remained in the towers to assist with the evacuation and rescue. New York City Police Department helicopters transported rescue personnel to the roof to assist in stairway evacuations of tenants on the upper floors.The general evacuation of WTC tenants took more than four hours. Rescuers checked more than 200 elevator cars\u2014freeing trapped people from 45 of them\u2014and searched each floor of the World Trade Center complex, more than eight million square feet of space. Later that evening, 28 people with medical conditions, including one woman in labor, were escorted to the roof by NYPD and airlifted to an EMS staging area.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> Place World Trade Center <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker terrorists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> Attacker small cell of terrorists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place World Trade Center <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "The 2001 shoe bomb attempt was a failed bombing attempt that occurred on December 22, 2001, on American Airlines Flight 63.The aircraft, a Boeing 767-300 (registration N384AA) with 197 passengers and crew aboard, was flying from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France, to Miami International Airport in the U.S. state of Florida.The perpetrator, Richard Reid, was subdued by passengers after unsuccessfully attempting to detonate plastic explosives concealed within his shoes.The flight was diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston, escorted by American jet fighters, and landed without further incident.Reid was arrested and eventually sentenced to 3 life terms plus 110 years, without parole.==Incident==As Flight 63 was flying over the Atlantic Ocean, Richard Reid \u2013 an Islamic fundamentalist from the United Kingdom, and self-proclaimed Al-Qaeda operative \u2013 carried shoes that were packed with two types of explosives.He had been refused permission to board the flight the day before.Passengers on the flight complained of a smoke smell shortly after meal service.One flight attendant, Hermis Moutardier, walked the aisles of the plane to locate the source.She found Reid sitting alone near a window, attempting to light a match.Moutardier warned him that smoking was not allowed on the airplane, and Reid promised to stop.A few minutes later, Moutardier found Reid leaning over in his seat, and unsuccessfully attempted to get his attention.After she asked him what he was doing, Reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse leading into the shoe, and a lit match.He was unable to detonate the bomb: perspiration from his feet dampened the triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and prevented it from igniting.Moutardier tried grabbing Reid twice, but he pushed her to the floor each time, and she screamed for help.When another flight attendant, Cristina Jones, arrived to try to subdue him, he fought her and bit her thumb.The  tall Reid who weighed about 215 pounds (97kg) was subdued by other passengers on the aircraft and immobilized using plastic handcuffs, seatbelt extensions, and headphone cords.A doctor administered diazepam found in the flight kit of the aircraft.Many of the passengers only became aware of the situation when the pilot announced that the flight was to be diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston.Two F-15 fighter jets escorted Flight 63 to Logan Airport.The plane parked in the middle of the runway, and Reid was arrested on the ground while the rest of the passengers were bussed to the main terminal.Authorities later found over 280\u00a0grams (10\u00a0oz) of TATP and PETN hidden in the hollowed soles of Reid's shoes, enough to blow a substantial hole in the aircraft.He pleaded guilty, was convicted, sentenced to 3 life terms plus 110 years without parole and incarcerated at Supermax prison ADX Florence.== Aftermath ==Six months after the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in Queens, New York on November 12, 2001, Mohammed Mansour Jabarah agreed to cooperate with American authorities in exchange for a reduced sentence.He said that fellow Canadian Abderraouf Jdey had been responsible for the flight's destruction, using a shoe bomb similar to that found on Reid several months earlier.This claim remains unsubstantiated by the investigation into the cause of the crash; Jabarah was a known colleague of Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, and said that Reid and Jdey had both been enlisted by the al-Qaeda chief to participate in identical plots.In 2006, security procedures at US airports were changed to have people remove their shoes before proceeding through scanners, in response to this incident.The requirement was phased out for some travelers, particularly those with TSA PreCheck, in the 2010s.Flight Number AAL63 continues to be used on the route from Paris to Miami.==External links==* Bomb on Flight 63 Telegraph Media Group

{"text": "Thai Authorities Indict 2 Over August Shrine AttackA Bangkok military court has indicted two men accused of carrying out the August 17 bombing at a popular shrine that killed 20 people.The court on Tuesday indicted Bilal Mohammed and Mieraili Yusufu on 10 counts connected to the blast, including conspiracy to explode bombs and commit premeditated murder.Thailand authorities have not officially named the bombing of Erawan Shrine an act of terror, and accordingly neither suspect was charged specifically with terrorism.Police issued 17 arrest warrants following the bombing but only Bilal and Mieraili have been detained. They are described as ethnic Uighurs, a minority group based in China's Xinjiang region. They have been held in custody since their arrests in late August and early September.Thai officials have said the blast was carried out by a people-smuggling gang seeking revenge on Thai authorities for cracking down on their operation.The August 17 blast at the Erawan Shrine - a popular tourist destination - was one of the most deadly acts of violence in Bangkok in decades, and left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured. Of the dead, 14 were tourists.The attack shocked the residents of the capital because of the apparent randomness, which drove home the point that no place is immune to acts of terror. Authorities, however, have declined to call it an act of terrorism out of apparent fear that it would hurt the country's huge tourism industry.Police initially appeared at first to be at a loss, but soon claimed success with a series of raids and two arrests. Arrest warrants have been issued for 15 others.The two suspects were brought to the court in handcuffs wearing brown prison garb. Members of the media were not allowed to enter the court and the indictments took place before the two suspects arrived, said defense lawyer Chuchart Kanpai.Doubts about motiveEarly speculation about the bombing had suggested it might be the work of Uighur separatists who were angry that Thailand in July forcibly repatriated more than 100 Uighurs to China, where it is feared they face persecution. The theory was bolstered by the fact that the Erawan Shrine is popular among Chinese tourists, who figured prominently among the victims of the bombing.But Thai officials reject any political or religious motive, sticking to the theory that it was a revenge for disrupting a human-smuggling gang. Still, skepticism about the police explanation on the shrine attack has abounded because of leaks, contradictions, misstatements and secrecy surrounding the investigation.The two suspects are being tried at a military court on an army base in Bangkok because cases of \u201cnational security\u201d have been handled by the military since last May, when the army seized power in a coup from an elected government.Former National Police Chief Somyot Poomphanmuang said before his retirement in September that the case against the two suspects was supported by closed-circuit television footage, witnesses, DNA matching and physical evidence, in addition to their confessions.Security camera footage from the Erawan Shrine showed a man wearing a yellow T-shirt who sat down on a bench at the outdoor shrine, took off a black backpack and then left it behind as he stood up and walked away. Time stamps on closed circuit TV footage showed he left the shrine just minutes before the blast occurred, during evening rush hour as the area in central Bangkok was filled with people.Police believe that Bilal is the yellow-shirted man who planted the bomb and Yusufu is believed to have detonated the bomb.Bilal, was initially identified as Adem Karadag, which was the name on a fake Turkish passport in his possession when he was arrested Aug. 29. He was arrested at one of two apartments police raided on the outskirts of Bangkok.Yusufu was arrested Sept. 1 near the Thai-Cambodia border, carrying a Chinese passport indicating he was from Xinjiang. Police said his DNA and fingerprints were found in both raided apartments, including on a container of gunpowder.Police said they have confessions from the two, and Bilal's lawyer says his client admitted planting the deadly bomb at the behest of another suspect who remains a fugitive.

{"text": "On 10 January 2015, nine people were killed and more than 30 wounded when two suicide bombers blew themselves up in a crowded caf\u00e9 in Jabal Mohsen, Tripoli, Lebanon.==Events==After the first explosion, the second suicide bomber approached the Abu Imran caf\u00e9.Before he could blow himself up, 60-year-old father of seven \"Abu Ali\" Issa Khaddour rushed and tackled the bomber, and prevented many deaths.The wounded were taken to the hospital in Zgharta, as Jabal Mohsen residents were afraid that Sunni Islamist mobs would kill Alawite wounded if taken to a hospital in Tripoli.The dead were buried on January 12.The al-Qaeda affiliated terrorist group Nusra Front took responsibility for the attacks, which targeted members of the Alawite sect.It was the first suicide attack on a civilian neighbourhood in nearly a year, following a security sweep that temporarily calmed the Bab al-Tabbaneh\u2013Jabal Mohsen conflict between Sunnis and Alawites of Tripoli.Nusra claimed the attack was in revenge for the Syrian government's attacks on Sunnis in the Syrian civil war, and for a bombing of Sunni mosques that was blamed on Alawites.The interior minister of Lebanon, Nohad Machnouk, said on January 11 that the attack was carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.==Reaction==The US strongly condemned the attack.On January 11, the Qalamoun branch of the Nusra Front threatened to conduct more attacks against Jabal Mohsen and Hezbollah.On 10 April 2015, one of the men implicated in the bombings was killed by Lebanese security forces.A suicide bombing was also supposed to have taken place in another Jabal Mohsen caf\u00e9 simultaneously with the 2015 Beirut bombings on November 12, but the supposed bomber was detained.==References==", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer bombers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Jabal Mohsen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim 30 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injurer bombers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target neighbourhood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Bab al-Tabbaneh <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact claimed <extra_id_0> Communicator Nusra <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator Nohad Machnouk <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Lebanon <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim men <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer forces <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Jabal Mohsen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Place Beirut <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "FBI Looking for 2 Men Who Allegedly Found Explosive Device in NYCThe U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is asking the public for help in locating two men who allegedly found a piece of luggage on a New York sidewalk that contained an explosive device that may be tied to the suspect in Saturday's bombings in New York and New Jersey.On Wednesday the FBI issued a statement and a photo of two men that was taken on Saturday, September 17, in the same hour an explosive device detonated. The FBI said the men took the luggage, which was located only four blocks or so from the New York bombing site, and left the device behind. That device did not detonate.Federal investigators said during a news conference Wednesday the men are wanted as witnesses only.Federal investigators said earlier the suspect in Saturday's bombings in New York and New Jersey has been charged with use of a weapon of mass destruction in the weekend attacks. Investigators said he bought components on eBay and used as triggering devices cell phones purchased from a store 500 meters from an address he once listed as his home.Evidence teams investigate at the scene of Saturday's explosion on West 23rd Street in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood in New York, Sept. 19, 2016. Ahmad Khan Rahami, a U.S. citizen of Afghan descent has been charged in the bombing.Multiple federal chargesThe details are contained in criminal complaints made public Tuesday spelling out multiple federal charges against 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami. Most of the charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.Authorities arrested Rahami on Monday after an exchange of gunfire with police that left him and two officers wounded.According to the court documents, investigators believe Rahami used an eBay account with the username \"ahmad rahimi\" to buy citric acid, a circuit board, electric igniters and hundreds of ball bearings between June 20 and August 10. The items were shipped to a business in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, where Rahami worked until September 12.Ball bearings were found in two pressure cooker bombs placed four blocks apart in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York late Saturday. One of them exploded, injuring 29 people, while the other was recovered intact. Investigators said the second bomb had \"numerous\" electric igniters.That second device was tested for fingerprints, and the criminal complaint said all 12 prints found were matches for Rahami. The documents say his prints were also found on items inside of a backpack that was discovered late Sunday at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, just outside of New York. The bag contained multiple explosive devices, including one that blew up as police tried to disarm it with a robot.Authorities also tied Rahami to a bomb that blew up in a trash can in Seaside Park, New Jersey, early Saturday.That link involved one of the cell phones that investigators said were shipped last year to a store in Perth Amboy near the address that Rahami provided as his home in a 2012 passport application. They said a second phone shipped to the same place was used in the bomb that blew up in Chelsea.A third phone, one found with the other Chelsea bomb, was once registered to one of Rahami's family members, the documents said.A still image captured from a video from WABC television shows New York bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami being loaded into an ambulance after a shoot-out with police in Linden, New Jersey, Sept. 19, 2016.Surveillance videoInvestigators also said they used surveillance video to tie Rahami to the Chelsea bombs, with cameras putting him near the explosion site about 37 minutes before the blast and near where the other bomb was found two minutes after the first one went off. That second video, they said, showed him pulling a suitcase and then a short time later walking without it.The documents contain some pieces of writing from a journal found on Rahami when he was arrested. The messages include praise of American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011, and \"Brother Osama Bin Laden,\" the former head of al-Qaida who was killed by U.S. forces in Pakistan in 2011.\"Inshallah the sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets. Gun shots to your police. Death To Your OPPRESSION,\" one message reads.The FBI said Tuesday it assessed Rahami's activities in 2014 after his father told agents he was concerned about his son's possible involvement with extremists.The agency found insufficient evidence to warrant further investigation.Rahami was born in Afghanistan, came to the U.S. at age 7 and became a naturalized American citizen.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Place New Jersey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place site <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonate <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Place New Jersey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle destruction <extra_id_0> Instrument weapon <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Instrument weapon <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant citizen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell purchased <extra_id_0> Giver store <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity cell phones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell bought <extra_id_0> Recipient he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Giver eBay <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity components <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigate <extra_id_0> Investigator teams <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Target West 23rd Street <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place neighborhood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges <extra_id_0> Defendant Ahmad Khan Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentence  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack gunfire <extra_id_0> Target police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation shipped <extra_id_0> Destination Perth Amboy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact items <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument One <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew up <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice that <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew up <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice that <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Seaside Park <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation shipped <extra_id_0> Destination store <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact phones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation shipped <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact phone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination place <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew up <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Chelsea <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place New York <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shoot-out <extra_id_0> Target police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Linden <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosion <extra_id_0> Place site <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast <extra_id_0> Place site <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack went off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Yemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strike <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Yemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Killer forces <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Pakistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack shots  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator agency <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

General Prawut Thavornsiri said fertilizer, explosives detonators and digital watches were seized during Sunday's search of multiple units in an apartment complex in the Min Buri district of Bangkok.Police claim rewardPolice on Monday also announced that a 3 million baht (about $83,000) reward offered to the public for information leading to the arrest of the bombing suspects would instead be paid to the police, after a 28-year-old foreign man was apprehended in a Saturday raid.The suspect faces charges of possessing explosives.\u201cThis was the work of the Thai officials, there were no tip-offs,\u201d the national police chief, General Somyot Pumpanmuang, told reporters as he displayed bundles of the reward cash he said was from his personal funds and a donation from an anonymous businessman friend of his.Officials said they found explosives, chemicals, ball bearings and other elements to make pipe bombs in a unit on the eastern outskirts of Bangkok where they apprehended the foreigner.FILE - Thai police stand on the balcony outside of an apartment building in Nong Jok on the outskirts of Bangkok, Aug. 29, 2015. Thai police say they arrested a suspect in the blast at the Erawan Shrine in this apartment building.The components were said to be similar to those used in devices that detonated at the Erawan Shrine on August 17 and in the Chao Phraya River, adjacent to the Sathorn Pier, the following day.The blast at the Hindu shrine, popular with Chinese and other Asian tourists, killed 20 people and wounded more than 100 others \u2013 the worst single mass casualty attack in Thailand.The subsequent explosion at the pier caused no injuries. Uighur deportationIt is unclear whether the shrine bombing has any connection to Thailand\u2019s deportation in July of more than 100 ethnic Uighurs to China, army commander-in-chief General Udomdej Sitabutr said Monday.Thai authorities have been hesitant to link the attack to international terrorism.Instead, authorities have insisted since Saturday that it is likely connected to a human smuggling organized crime ring or a gang bent on revenge for crackdowns by police.Analysts have given those explanations little credence and human rights groups have expressed concern about how the lack of legitimate political, security and judicial authority in a country under military government could undermine public trust in the investigation\u2019s outcome.The head of the Thai military junta, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, has cautioned against concluding that the shrine bombing was linked to international terrorism or mentioning any possible connection to Turkey.Thai police Lieutenant General Prawut Thavornsiri speaks to the media at the Royal Thai Police headquarters in Bangkok, Thailand, Aug. 30, 2015.In recent days speculation had increased about the bombing\u2019s possible link to China's ethnic Uighur minority or their co-religious sympathizers in Turkey.Thailand's deportation of the Uighurs led to an attack on the Thai consulate in Istanbul where windows were smashed.The Turkish Embassy in Bangkok denied that the arrested suspect is a citizen of Turkey, Lt. General Prawut told reporters on Sunday.Authorities also made conflicting statements Saturday and Sunday on whether they believed the man was the suspect caught on closed circuit television images leaving a package at the popular Hindu shrine in central Bangkok just prior to the explosion.CriticizedThe junta also came under criticism after airing a photograph of a suicide vest while its officials discussed evidence found on Saturday they said was related to the bombings.It was quickly pointed out that the picture of the vest had come from a 2013 blog online of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration.That disclosure prompted Thai authorities to acknowledge the photograph had no connection to their case and they demanded the media and public refrain from further disseminating the picture.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Bangkok <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Jailer man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Jailer suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges <extra_id_0> Defendant suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Jailer they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice devices <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Erawan Shrine <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Chao Phraya River <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast <extra_id_0> Target shrine <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime smuggling <extra_id_0> Perpetrator gang <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime revenge <extra_id_0> Perpetrator ring <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target shrine <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack Bombing <extra_id_0> Target Bangkok <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Place Thailand <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing\u2019s  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "On 17 January 2019, a vehicle was driven into the General Santander National Police Academy in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The truck forced its way into the facility, hit a wall and detonated, killing 22 people (including the perpetrator) and injuring 68 others. Suicide attacks are unusual in Colombia. The car contained about  of pentolite. It was the deadliest attack on the Colombian capital since the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing and the first terrorist attack on the capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing. The National Liberation Army (ELN) accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the Colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire.==Background===== Colombian conflict ===The Colombian conflict started in 1964, although systematic violence in the country can be dated since the end of the 19th century (Thousand Days' War). The National Liberation Army (ELN) is one of the most prominent participants of the ongoing conflict. For decades, residents of Bogot\u00e1 lived in fear of being a victim of a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar's Medell\u00edn drug cartel. But as Colombia's conflict has wound down, and the nation's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.Sporadic attacks have affected the city since the peace deal was initiated. The most prominent was an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 which killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary's Movement for the bombing.=== Peace dialogue ===The 2016 peace deal between the FARC and Colombian government resulted in the ELN gaining strength in the region. The Colombian government has attempted to establish peace dialogue with the ELN since 2017, though ELN groups have rejected conditions placed by the government, such as the end of criminal actions including violent attacks and kidnappings. The ELN, however, persisted that the Colombian government should continue dialogue without making any demands towards the group. Between 2017 and up until the attack, Colombian officials stated that the ELN had participated in at least 400 terrorist attacks in the nation since dialogue began, including the shoot down of a civilian helicopter and the kidnapping of its occupants.=== ELN in Venezuela ===According to InSight Crime, the ELN and FARC dissidents allegedly met together in Venezuela to form a potential alliance in October 2018. Sources based in the Arauca department in Colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. It was also alleged that former FARC commander Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez participated in the talks with the ELN.In November 2018, InSight Crime also reported that the ELN was present in over twelve Venezuelan states, spanning from the Colombia-Venezuela border in the west across Venezuela and into Brazil and Guyana to the east. Insight Crime states that Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was tolerant of the ELN, explaining that \"ELN\u2019s expansion in Venezuela has been marked by the Maduro administration\u2019s inaction and even encouragement towards the group\", with reports from Venezuelan NGO Fundaci\u00f3n Redes that the Venezuelan military had possibly armed ELN members.==Events===== Planning ===Attorney General  identified the perpetrator as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, known as \"Mocho Kiko\" because of his missing hand due to a previous explosion, a 57-year-old from the northern department of Boyac\u00e1. Rojas is alleged to have been involved with the ELN for three decades and served as an intelligence chief for a branch of the group. Since 2011, Rojas is alleged to have been teaching guerrilla militants in Venezuela how to construct explosives.Ricardo Carvajal, who was previously investigated for drug trafficking in 2012 but was acquitted of the charges, allegedly contracted Rojas for the bombing due to his experience. The bombing, according to Colombian authorities, had been planned for more than ten months. In May 2018, Colombian records show that Rojas purchased a 1993 Nissan Patrol from Mauricio Mosquera, who was previously charged with terrorism and rebellion. On 27 July 2018, the vehicle was officially inspected in Arauca, Arauca, a city found on the border of Colombia and Venezuela where the ELN mainly controls territory.=== Attack ===The authorities stated that on 17 January 2019 at 9:30am, Rojas drove his grey 1993 Nissan Patrol loaded with  of pentolite to the campus of the General Santander National Police Academy and dropped off a passenger at a nearby bus stop. Rojas then reportedly drove his truck down a side street used for deliveries to make his way onto the campus. When a detection dog signaled explosives on the vehicle, the driver forced his vehicle through a security checkpoint and struck security guards. The explosives in the truck were then detonated near the women's dormitories at the police academy as students were leaving a promotion ceremony. It is unknown if the driver detonated the explosives or if it was possibly the individual he left near the bus stop who remotely triggered the device.In the immediate aftermath, the authorities began investigating Rojas's possible connections to either the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla movement, the Clan \u00dasuga organized crime gang, or FARC dissidents.=== Initial investigations ===On 18 January, Defence Minister  identified Rojas Rodr\u00edguez as a long-time member of the ELN, within which he served as an explosives expert. Investigators were able to identify Rojas with security camera footage and fingerprints from his remaining hand.A second individual, who Attorney General Mart\u00ednez said \"had participated in the attack\", was arrested in Bogot\u00e1 at 2:30am on the day following the attack.  The individual was identified as Ricardo Carvajal after he allegedly confessed to the bombings over a telephone call investigators intercepted. He was found with a \"combatant's manual\" and numerous coveralls. Carvajal Salgar denied that he was involved in the attack and his family stated that the coveralls were used for the jobs he worked.According to Colombian authorities, there are on-going operations throughout Bogot\u00e1 and the department of Arauca to capture other individuals suspected of having been involved in the attack, and that the ELN was responsible despite the organization not taking claim for the attack as it has done in the past.=== Peace dialogue ends ===President Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez announced on 18 January that peace dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the ELN was officially suspended. Duque also demanded that Cuba extradite the ten ELN leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their Interpol Red Notices, and he criticized Venezuela for providing refuge for the ELN on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In response to the request, Cuba's Foreign Minister announced that Cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties.The President of the National Constituent Assembly of Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello, denied any Venezuelan involvement in the attacks on 18 January. On 21 January, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called for a \"concrete response\" from the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela on whether the ELN was present in Venezuela, explaining that prior to the attack, the Colombian government asked the Venezuelan government on the potential presence of ELN groups in Venezuela without a response. Holmes Trujillo also stated that the Maduro government had taken \"evasive positions\" when speaking about the ELN.===Claim of responsibility===ELN accepted the responsibility for the attack, saying the bombing was carried out in retaliation for the Colombian government not honoring the ceasefire by carrying out attacks on its camps. It justified that government and the cadres of its security forces had therefore become legitimate targets and called for resuming peace dialogue. High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos spoke out against its members being sheltered anymore now that it had claimed responsibility.==International reactions==A foreign national, identified as a female cadet from Ecuador, was killed in the attack, while three nationals from Panama, one from the United States and another also from Ecuador were wounded. Their respective governments have expressed their condemnation for the attack and assistance to their citizens.* Cuba: Cuba shared condolences with Colombia, with its foreign ministry stating Cuba \"will act with strict respect for the Protocols of Dialogue and Peace signed by the Government and the ELN, including the Protocol in Case of a Rupture in Negotiations\".* Ecuador: President Len\u00edn Moreno lamented the death of Erika Chic\u00f3, the Ecuadorian cadet killed in the attack, and expressed his condolences to Colombia. He also announced that he was to send Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner to Bogot\u00e1 accompanied by Chic\u00f3's relatives.* Panama: The Panamanian embassy in Bogot\u00e1 expressed its indignation at the attack, and provided a phone number for information about Panamanian cadets affected.* United States: The Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Kimberly Breier condemned the bombing and said: \"Our condolences and sympathies go to the victims and family members of those killed\", while the U.S. Embassy in Bogot\u00e1 offered its \"help in investigating this reprehensible attack\".Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and the Organization of American States also condemned the attack.==References==", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Transportation driven
