{"text": "On 4 December 1971, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group, detonated a bomb at McGurk's Bar in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The pub was frequented by Irish Catholics/nationalists. The explosion caused the building to collapse, killing fifteen Catholic civilians\u2014including two children\u2014and wounding seventeen more. It was the deadliest attack in Belfast during the Troubles.Despite evidence to the contrary, the British security forces asserted that a bomb had exploded prematurely while being handled by Irish Republican Army (IRA) members inside the pub, implying that the victims themselves were partly to blame. A report later found that the police (Royal Ulster Constabulary) were biased in favour of this view, and that this hindered their investigation. The victims' relatives allege that the security forces deliberately spread disinformation to discredit the IRA. In 1977, UVF member Robert Campbell was sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in the bombing and served fifteen years.The bombing sparked a series of tit-for-tat bombings and shootings by loyalists and republicans, which contributed to making 1972 the bloodiest year of the conflict.==Background==McGurk's (also called the Tramore Bar) was a two-storey public house on the corner of North Queen Street and Great George's Street, in the New Lodge area to the north of Belfast city centre. This was a mainly Irish nationalist and Catholic neighbourhood, and the pub's regular customers were from the community. The pub was owned by Patrick and Philomena McGurk, who lived on the upper floor with their four children.The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) was formed in Belfast in 1966, declaring \"war\" on the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Until 1971, however, its actions were few and it \"scarcely existed in an organisational sense\". The British Army was deployed in Northern Ireland following the August 1969 riots, which are usually seen as the start of the Troubles. In December 1969 the IRA split into two factions: the 'Official' IRA and Provisional IRA. Both launched armed campaigns against the British Army, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the government of Northern Ireland.During 1971, the violence gradually worsened. There were daily bombings and shootings by republicans, loyalists and the security forces. During the first two weeks of December, there were about 70 bombings and about 30 people were killed. On 2 December, three republican prisoners escaped from Crumlin Road prison, not far from McGurk's. Security was tightened and there was a heavy RUC and British Army presence in the area over the next two days. Eyewitnesses asserted that the checkpoints around McGurk's were removed just an hour before the attack.==Bombing==On the evening of Saturday 4 December 1971, a four-man UVF team met in the Shankill area of Belfast and were ordered to bomb a pub on North Queen Street. According to the only convicted bomber\u2014Robert Campbell\u2014they were told not to return until the job was done. Campbell said that their target had not been McGurk's, but another pub nearby. It is believed this was a pub called The Gem, which was allegedly linked to the Official IRA. The  bomb was disguised as a brown parcel, which they placed in a car and drove to their target. Campbell says they stopped near The Gem at about 7:30pm, but could not gain access to it because there were security guards outside. After waiting for almost an hour, they drove a short distance to McGurk's. At about 8:45pm, one of them placed the bomb in the porch entrance on Great George's Street and rushed back to the car. It exploded just moments after they drove off. Campbell implied that McGurk's had been chosen only because it was \"the nearest Catholic pub\".The blast caused the building to collapse. Bystanders immediately rushed to free the dead and wounded from the rubble. Firefighters, paramedics, police and soldiers were quickly on the scene. Fifteen Catholic civilians had been killed\u2014including two children\u2014and a further seventeen wounded. The rescue effort lasted many hours.Within two hours of the blast, a sectarian clash had erupted nearby at the New Lodge\u2013Tiger's Bay interface. The British Army and RUC moved in and a gun battle developed. A British Army officer, Major Jeremy Snow, was shot by the IRA on New Lodge Road and died of his wounds on 8 December. Two RUC officers and five civilians were also wounded by gunfire. Eventually, five companies of troops were sent into the district and they searched almost 50 houses.Meanwhile, the UVF team had driven to a nearby pickup point where they dumped their car. They walked to the area of St Anne's Cathedral and were picked up by another. They were driven back to the Shankill and met the man who had ordered the attack in an Orange Hall, telling him that \"the job has been done\".Among those killed were Philomena and Maria McGurk, wife and 14-year-old daughter of the pub owner Patrick McGurk. Patrick and his three sons were seriously injured. Shortly after the attack, McGurk appeared on television calling for no retaliation: \"It doesn't matter who planted the bomb. What's done can't be undone. I've been trying to keep bitterness out of it.\"==Investigation=====Responsibility===After the bombing, the media reported various theories about who was responsible. The main theories were:*that it had been planted by loyalists;*that it had exploded prematurely while being prepared by IRA members inside the pub;*that it had exploded prematurely while \"in transit\", an IRA member having left it in the pub to be collected by another IRA member; and*that it had been planted as part of a feud between the Provisional IRA and Official IRA.The security forces promoted the idea that it was an IRA bomb which exploded prematurely (an \"own goal\"). Survivors and relatives denied this. They said the pub was not associated with the IRA and there had been no suspicious people or activity in the pub that night. An Intelligence Corps document from December 1971 also said that the pub was not known to have IRA associations. On 6 December, both wings of the IRA condemned the attack, denied responsibility and blamed the UVF and security forces.====Claims of responsibility====That same day, several newspapers received telephone calls from someone claiming to be a spokesman for the \"Empire Loyalists\". Their statement to the Belfast Telegraph was:We [the Empire Loyalists] accept responsibility for the destruction of McGurk's pub. We placed 30lb of new explosives outside the pub because we had proved beyond doubt that meetings of IRA Provisionals and Officials were held there. The \"Empire Loyalists\" had made only one other claim of responsibility; for bombing a community centre on 12 November. The RUC, however, had no intelligence about such a group; suggesting that it may have been a covername.On Tuesday 7 December, a youth claimed to have seen a man acting oddly at a phone kiosk the night before. He said the man was wearing a jacket with a UVF badge on it. The youth claimed to have checked the kiosk after the man left and found a torn bit of paper. When put together, it included the lines:We the Empire Loyalists wish to state that we did not destroy McGurk's public house as an act of retaliation ... Furthermore we do not require the forensic experts of the Army to cover up for us ... We shall not issue any further statements until we exterminate another rebel stronghold.In the days following the bombing, the RUC received a letter signed by \"Chief of Staff, UVF\" claiming that the UVF bombed the pub because an IRA meeting was due to take place there. It said that two UVF members entered the pub, had a drink and asked the barman to mind a package while they \"ran an errand\". Witnesses told the RUC, however, that there had been no strangers in the pub and that nobody had left a package. Three other unsigned letters were sent to the RUC, claiming it was an IRA bomb \"in transit\" and that two IRA members were killed.====Location of the bomb====For the RUC, the location of the bomb (whether it exploded inside or outside) became the key to finding who was responsible. However, investigators (both RUC and British Army) were unsure and gave conflicting opinions.RUC duty officers' reports were made daily. Their purpose was to brief the Chief Constable and others at HQ about events that had happened that day. The reports were also made available to the British Army's General Officer Commanding for Northern Ireland. The 4\u20135 December 1971 report said of the bombing: \"Just before the explosion a man entered the licensed premises and left down a suitcase, presumably to be picked up by a known member of the IRA. The bomb was intended for use on other premises. Before the 'pick-up' was made the bomb exploded\". The origin of this information could not be established.On 6 December, however, the RUC took a witness statement from an 8-year-old boy. He said that a car had stopped outside the pub with four men inside and \"a wee Union Jack stuck in the back window\". He said one left a package in the Great George's Street doorway and ran back to the car, which sped off just moments before the package exploded. A man and a woman backed up his story, although they did not witness as much as the boy. Despite this, the security forces and the government stood behind the \"own goal\" theory. A British Intelligence Corps document covering the period 8\u201315 December said: \"It has been confirmed that it was a [Provisional IRA] bomb which was destined for another target, but exploded prematurely.\" A Ministry of Defence (MOD) document dated 14 December said that this \"should be publicised\". On 23 December, the British Army sent a letter (signed by a lieutenant colonel) to people living in north Belfast. It said that when the IRA in the area is destroyed, \"we can look forward to \u2026 a period in which you will not lose your friends in a repetition of the [IRA's] accident in the McGurk\u2019s bar.\"===Arrest and conviction of Robert Campbell===In March 1976, the RUC received intelligence that linked UVF member Robert Campbell and four others to the McGurk's bombing. Campbell was arrested on 27 July 1977 and held at Castlereagh RUC base. He was interviewed seven times during 27 and 28 July. He admitted his part in the bombing but refused to name the others. Campbell's story matches that given by the young boy witness.On 29 July 1977, Campbell was charged with the 15 murders and 17 attempted murders. On 6 September 1978 he pleaded guilty to all charges and received life imprisonment with \"a recommendation to serve no less than 20 years\", in part for a separate conviction for the murder of a Protestant delivery driver in 1976. He is the only person to have been charged for the bombing. He eventually served fifteen years in prison and was released on 9 September 1993.===Collusion claims and Police Ombudsman's investigation===The victims' relatives campaigned for an independent investigation of the bombing as they believed that the RUC's investigation was flawed from the outset. Moreover, they wished to disprove the claim that the victims were IRA members killed by their own bomb (the \"own goal\" theory). Even after Campbell's conviction, the \"own goal\" theory remained officially unchallenged. Relatives argued that this theory was promoted as part of a \"government policy to avoid publicly acknowledging the loyalist campaign of violence\". Another argument is that it was promoted to undermine the IRA's support and stir tension between the two IRA factions.Relatives also asked how the bombers were able to plant the bomb and flee despite the usually heavy security presence. Some alleged that the security forces helped the bombers by removing checkpoints. The 2009 book Killing For Britain, written by former UVF member 'John Black', claimed that the British undercover unit known as the Military Reaction Force or Military Reconnaissance Force (MRF) organized the bombing and helped the bombers get in and out of the area. The bombers' original target, The Gem, was associated with the Official IRA. It is claimed that the MRF ordered the team to bomb The Gem, with the intention of blaming it on the Provisional IRA. The plan was allegedly to start a feud between the two IRA factions, which would both divert them from their campaign against British forces and drain their support. However, as The Gem had security outside, they bombed the nearest 'Catholic pub'.On 21 February 2011, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland published a report about the bombing and the RUC's investigation of it. The report said that there is no evidence that the RUC helped the UVF bombers. However, it found that the RUC investigation was biased in favour of the view that the IRA was responsible. It failed to give enough thought to the possible involvement of loyalists, and this bias hindered the investigation. The report also found that RUC gave \"selective\" and \"misleading\" briefings to the government and media, which furthered the idea that it was an IRA bomb. The Ombudsman has not found an explanation why successive Chief Constables have not addressed this mistake. Ombudsman Al Hutchinson said: \"Inconsistent police briefings, some of which inferred that victims of the bombing were culpable in the atrocity, caused the bereaved families great distress, which has continued for many years\".On 6 December 2012, Scottish Labour MP Michael Connarty - whose uncle was killed in the bombing - claimed in Westminster that then-Prime Minister Edward Heath \"may have been involved\" in wrongfully blaming the IRA and spreading the story. Connarty also urged David Cameron, Prime Minister at the time, to apologise to victims and launch a full investigation.==Remembrance==In 2001 a memorial was unveiled on the site of McGurk's Bar to mark the 30th anniversary of the bombing. Relatives of the victims called for an investigation into allegations that British forces helped the bombers. Almost a thousand people attended a service at St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street, after which fifteen wreaths, one for each victim, were carried by relatives leading a silent candlelit procession to a new memorial at Great George's Street.Patrick McGurk died on 15 December 2007, having forgiven those responsible for the explosion and having prayed for the men who carried out the attack.==See

{"text": "Counting civilian casualties in CIA\u2019s drone warA report released in September by human rights researchers at Stanford Law School and New York University Law School sets out to demonstrate that U.S. drone policies are \"damaging and counterproductive.\"Media outlets from CNN to BBC hailed the report as new evidence of the U.S. government\u2019s false narrative on drones and the New York Times\u2018 Scott Shane described the study as \"among the most thorough on the subject to date.\"While the Stanford-NYU report certainly presents a comprehensive review of existing drone research, its new contributions to the evidentiary record are far more modest than its sweeping conclusions would suggest.Number CrunchingThe U.S. government claims that civilian casualties caused by drones are in the \"single digits\" during Obama\u2019s years in office, while the Stanford-NYU report seeks to establish that there is significant evidence that U.S. drone strikes have killed and injured a larger number of civilians. This is a low bar, and would merely necessitate proving that more than 10 civilians have been killed by drones since Obama assumed office, a claim that has been made by all three major databases aggregating information on drone strikes. The Stanford-NYU report goes further, claiming that between 474 and 881 civilians have been killed since 2004.However, this does not represent new evidence. Stanford and NYU researchers made no attempt to offer new statistical analysis on the number of civilian casualties caused by drones. Rather, their report is essentially an extended endorsement of a database compiled by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a small team of journalists based out of City University, London. In doing so, the report rejects the findings of two other widely cited databases, The Long War Journal, which reports 138 civilian deaths and New America Foundation\u2019s Year of the Drone, which lists 152-191 civilian deaths and the deaths of 130-268 \"unknowns.\"If the Stanford-NYU team wants to paint a picture of the U.S. as a human rights abuser, then the Bureau, whose casualty statistics dwarf the more conservative estimates of the other databases, is best suited to that purpose, but that does not make it the most reliable source.While a comprehensive assessment of the Bureau\u2019s data should have been conducted before giving it a resounding endorsement, just a cursory review of its account of 2012\u2019s drone strikes reveals problems:\u2013 On May 5, 2012 the Bureau reports that a strike in North Waziristan killed 8-10 people, of whom between zero and ten are listed as civilians. Upon reviewing the accompanying sources one find that early reports said the identity of the dead could not be determined, but subsequent reports from government officials identified them as militants. Of the 15 sources cited by the Bureau, not one states that the victims were civilians.-On June 2, 2012 the Bureau reports that 2-4 people were killed and between zero and two of them were civilians. These civilian deaths were inferred based on a report that a motorbike was accidentally hit, but the Bureau fails to take note of a later report from The Express Tribune identifying the motorbike victims as suspected militants Khalil Yargul Khail and Rehmanullah Gangi Khail.-On July 23, 2012 the Bureau references 25 sources for a drone strike, only one of which described the victims as local residents and based on this the Bureau reports that up to 14 civilians were killed.The Stanford-NYU report critiques the Long War Journal for not making its data available in a verifiable strike-by-strike format, over-relying on U.S. intelligence sources, and identifying all victims as militants unless they are specifically identified as civilians. These are reasonable criticisms, but when the critique turns to New America Foundation research, it becomes logically inconsistent.While Stanford-NYU researchers admit that all three databases rely on \"the same universe of publicly available press reports,\" they criticize only the New America Foundation for over-relying on the anonymous Pakistani government officials cited in such news reports. The Stanford-NYU report laments that these officials are cited in 88% of articles referenced in New America\u2019s 2012 data but fails to consider that these same articles are referenced by the Bureau. Furthermore, the only reason the researchers were able to generate that statistic is because New America compiles a highly transparent summary of media sources relied on for each strike with a list of which sources reported which casualty estimates, something no other database provides.The Stanford-NYU report goes on to question the \"deep reporting\" capabilities of New America\u2019s sources (The New York Times, Reuters, AP, BBC, etc.) while uncritically accepting the veracity of reports from fringe outlets such as the Kuwait News Agency, the South Asian News Agency, Central Asia Online, and Punjab News, which are sometimes the sole sources for the Bureau\u2019s reports of civilian casualties.This is not to suggest that the Bureau\u2019s research is without merit, but it should be noted that it represents an interpretation of the facts with a bias toward reporting civilian casualties. The Bureau\u2019s database does not even have a category for reporting militant deaths. It seems counter-intuitive that the organization\u2019s researchers can have such absolute faith in their civilian casualty estimates, but not have the confidence to label any of the deceased as militants.And the Stanford-NYU team was not impartial. By the report\u2019s own admission, the research project it undertook in Pakistan to interview family members of drone strike victims was commissioned by Reprieve, a UK based advocacy organization. Reprieve, which filed two lawsuits on behalf of alleged drone victims in May of 2012, arranged, paid for and collaborated on many of the victim interviews conducted by the Stanford-NYU researchers.No database is perfect, but a strong argument could be made that the New America Foundation\u2019s policy of attempting to identify both militants and civilians while maintaining an explicit category for \"unknowns\" to represent the uncertainty surrounding many of the strikes is a more balanced representation of the facts. After all, if the public is to assess the efficacy of drone strikes then we need to consider the strikes that hit their targets as well as the ones that do not.Stanford and NYU\u2019s analysis of the three drone databases, in some respects, misses the forest for the trees. A comparison of the annual data collected by the Bureau with that compiled by the New America Foundation suggests that while their numbers may differ, their underlying findings are substantially similar. Both the Bureau and New America have observed a general decline in the percentage of civilian fatalities since the high in 2006, with a sharp decrease during the Obama administration. According to the Bureau\u2019s data, the proportion of civilians killed in drone strikes fell from 35 percent in 2008 under President Bush to 9 percent thus far in 2012. Similarly, New America reports that the rate of civilian and unknown casualties decreased from 23 percent in 2008 to 2 percent in 2012. This stands to reason when we consider that the Bureau tends to err on the side of assuming that unidentified dead or individuals of disputed identity are civilians, while New America prefers to accommodate ambiguity by listing \"unknowns\" and only reports a civilian or militant casualty when it is reported by two independent sources.If one takes the average number of civilian and unknown deaths counted by the New America Foundation from 2004-2012 as a percentage of the total number of people killed in drone strikes, the civilian and unknown deaths represent 15 percent of the total. The Bureau\u2019s data suggests that civilian deaths account for 22 percent of the total killed. These numbers are in fact, not so very far apart. And while the Bureau has criticized New America for reporting that in 2012, civilian deaths are approaching zero, the Bureau\u2019s own data suggests that the percentage of civilian casualties in 2012 is at nine percent, an all-time low and significantly less than the 23 percent the Bureau reports during Obama\u2019s first year in office. This suggests that the choice is not between two very different data sets, but rather two different interpretations of similar evidence. Contrary to the Stanford-NYU report\u2019s claims, the New America Foundation is not underreporting civilian casualties; its researchers have simply chosen not to feign certainty in the face of ambiguity.What They Didn\u2019t SayThe Stanford-NYU researchers also fail to incorporate evidence that might temper their claims. Their report makes numerous references to an AP investigative report that interviewed 80 villagers at the sites of the ten deadliest attacks in 2011 and 2012 but neglects its conclusions that \"a significant majority of the dead were combatants\" and the numbers of casualties gathered by AP investigators \"turned out to be very close to those given by Pakistani intelligence on the day of each strike.\"Numerous media accounts, including the LA Times, have highlighted that \"the [Stanford-NYU] study concludes that only about 2 percent of drone casualties are top militant leaders.\" The study reached no such conclusion. This claim is based on research conducted by New America and published last month on CNN. While the Stanford-NYU report summarily dismissed New America\u2019s militant and civilian casualty estimates, they have been quick to make this statistic a centerpiece of their argument. In doing so, they also take the conclusion out of context, and ignore the possible tactical utility of deliberately targeting low-level militants. Indeed, destroying communication centers, training camps and vehicles undermines the operational effectiveness of al-Qaeda and the Taliban, and quotes from operatives of the Pakistan-based Haqqani Network reveal that drones have forced them into a \"jungle existence\" where they fear for the lives on a daily basis.A second key contention of the Stanford-NYU report is that drone strikes are \"damaging and counterproductive\" to U.S. national security. However, it is shortsighted to evaluate U.S. security in isolation from Pakistani domestic order. Terrorist attacks have been a pervasive problem in Pakistan, especially since 2007. While the report references these attacks and the frequent assassinations carried out by Taliban forces, it makes no reference to recent research by an analyst at the RAND Corporation, who identifies a negative correlation between drone strikes and militant violence inside Pakistan, indicating that the rate of violence has gone down as the rate of drone strikes has gone up. Analysis by New America suggests that while only 10 percent of drone strikes target al-Qaeda operatives, approximately 50 percent hit Taliban targets and in 2009, 19 of the first 32 drone strikes targeted the organization of Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban who was ultimately responsible for the deaths of thousands of Pakistanis, and the alleged mastermind of the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Mehsud was a far greater threat to Pakistani security than that of the United States.Key FindingsThese criticisms are not to suggest that the Stanford-NYU report is without merit. The anecdotal evidence on the adverse mental health impact of drones, the economic hardships created by attacks and the restriction of movement caused by FATA residents\u2019 anxiety about potential strikes are all valuable contributions to the public\u2019s understanding of drones, as is the report\u2019s succinct and cogent summary of some of the key legal issues. Both of these topics merit further research and the teams at Stanford and NYU seem well poised to continue contributing in these areas.However it would be a mistake to unequivocally accept all of the report\u2019s conclusions or its stance on the civilian casualty debate. The U.S. government\u2019s claims that civilian casualties from drone strikes during Obama\u2019s term in office are in the single digits are manifestly untrue, but there is no need to overstate the rate of civilian deaths to make the point that drones strikes are legally suspect and morally hazardous.Meg Braun is a Rhodes Scholar and MPhil candidate in International Relations at Oxford, where she is researching the evolution of U.S. drone policy.

{"text": "On 17 January 2019, a vehicle was driven into the General Santander National Police Academy in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The truck forced its way into the facility, hit a wall and detonated, killing 22 people (including the perpetrator) and injuring 68 others. Suicide attacks are unusual in Colombia. The car contained about  of pentolite. It was the deadliest attack on the Colombian capital since the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing and the first terrorist attack on the capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing. The National Liberation Army (ELN) accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the Colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire.==Background===== Colombian conflict ===The Colombian conflict started in 1964, although systematic violence in the country can be dated since the end of the 19th century (Thousand Days' War). The National Liberation Army (ELN) is one of the most prominent participants of the ongoing conflict. For decades, residents of Bogot\u00e1 lived in fear of being a victim of a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar's Medell\u00edn drug cartel. But as Colombia's conflict has wound down, and the nation's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.Sporadic attacks have affected the city since the peace deal was initiated. The most prominent was an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 which killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary's Movement for the bombing.=== Peace dialogue ===The 2016 peace deal between the FARC and Colombian government resulted in the ELN gaining strength in the region. The Colombian government has attempted to establish peace dialogue with the ELN since 2017, though ELN groups have rejected conditions placed by the government, such as the end of criminal actions including violent attacks and kidnappings. The ELN, however, persisted that the Colombian government should continue dialogue without making any demands towards the group. Between 2017 and up until the attack, Colombian officials stated that the ELN had participated in at least 400 terrorist attacks in the nation since dialogue began, including the shoot down of a civilian helicopter and the kidnapping of its occupants.=== ELN in Venezuela ===According to InSight Crime, the ELN and FARC dissidents allegedly met together in Venezuela to form a potential alliance in October 2018. Sources based in the Arauca department in Colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. It was also alleged that former FARC commander Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez participated in the talks with the ELN.In November 2018, InSight Crime also reported that the ELN was present in over twelve Venezuelan states, spanning from the Colombia-Venezuela border in the west across Venezuela and into Brazil and Guyana to the east. Insight Crime states that Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was tolerant of the ELN, explaining that \"ELN\u2019s expansion in Venezuela has been marked by the Maduro administration\u2019s inaction and even encouragement towards the group\", with reports from Venezuelan NGO Fundaci\u00f3n Redes that the Venezuelan military had possibly armed ELN members.==Events===== Planning ===Attorney General  identified the perpetrator as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, known as \"Mocho Kiko\" because of his missing hand due to a previous explosion, a 57-year-old from the northern department of Boyac\u00e1. Rojas is alleged to have been involved with the ELN for three decades and served as an intelligence chief for a branch of the group. Since 2011, Rojas is alleged to have been teaching guerrilla militants in Venezuela how to construct explosives.Ricardo Carvajal, who was previously investigated for drug trafficking in 2012 but was acquitted of the charges, allegedly contracted Rojas for the bombing due to his experience. The bombing, according to Colombian authorities, had been planned for more than ten months. In May 2018, Colombian records show that Rojas purchased a 1993 Nissan Patrol from Mauricio Mosquera, who was previously charged with terrorism and rebellion. On 27 July 2018, the vehicle was officially inspected in Arauca, Arauca, a city found on the border of Colombia and Venezuela where the ELN mainly controls territory.=== Attack ===The authorities stated that on 17 January 2019 at 9:30am, Rojas drove his grey 1993 Nissan Patrol loaded with  of pentolite to the campus of the General Santander National Police Academy and dropped off a passenger at a nearby bus stop. Rojas then reportedly drove his truck down a side street used for deliveries to make his way onto the campus. When a detection dog signaled explosives on the vehicle, the driver forced his vehicle through a security checkpoint and struck security guards. The explosives in the truck were then detonated near the women's dormitories at the police academy as students were leaving a promotion ceremony. It is unknown if the driver detonated the explosives or if it was possibly the individual he left near the bus stop who remotely triggered the device.In the immediate aftermath, the authorities began investigating Rojas's possible connections to either the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla movement, the Clan \u00dasuga organized crime gang, or FARC dissidents.=== Initial investigations ===On 18 January, Defence Minister  identified Rojas Rodr\u00edguez as a long-time member of the ELN, within which he served as an explosives expert. Investigators were able to identify Rojas with security camera footage and fingerprints from his remaining hand.A second individual, who Attorney General Mart\u00ednez said \"had participated in the attack\", was arrested in Bogot\u00e1 at 2:30am on the day following the attack.  The individual was identified as Ricardo Carvajal after he allegedly confessed to the bombings over a telephone call investigators intercepted. He was found with a \"combatant's manual\" and numerous coveralls. Carvajal Salgar denied that he was involved in the attack and his family stated that the coveralls were used for the jobs he worked.According to Colombian authorities, there are on-going operations throughout Bogot\u00e1 and the department of Arauca to capture other individuals suspected of having been involved in the attack, and that the ELN was responsible despite the organization not taking claim for the attack as it has done in the past.=== Peace dialogue ends ===President Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez announced on 18 January that peace dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the ELN was officially suspended. Duque also demanded that Cuba extradite the ten ELN leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their Interpol Red Notices, and he criticized Venezuela for providing refuge for the ELN on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In response to the request, Cuba's Foreign Minister announced that Cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties.The President of the National Constituent Assembly of Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello, denied any Venezuelan involvement in the attacks on 18 January. On 21 January, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called for a \"concrete response\" from the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela on whether the ELN was present in Venezuela, explaining that prior to the attack, the Colombian government asked the Venezuelan government on the potential presence of ELN groups in Venezuela without a response. Holmes Trujillo also stated that the Maduro government had taken \"evasive positions\" when speaking about the ELN.===Claim of responsibility===ELN accepted the responsibility for the attack, saying the bombing was carried out in retaliation for the Colombian government not honoring the ceasefire by carrying out attacks on its camps. It justified that government and the cadres of its security forces had therefore become legitimate targets and called for resuming peace dialogue. High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos spoke out against its members being sheltered anymore now that it had claimed responsibility.==International reactions==A foreign national, identified as a female cadet from Ecuador, was killed in the attack, while three nationals from Panama, one from the United States and another also from Ecuador were wounded. Their respective governments have expressed their condemnation for the attack and assistance to their citizens.* Cuba: Cuba shared condolences with Colombia, with its foreign ministry stating Cuba \"will act with strict respect for the Protocols of Dialogue and Peace signed by the Government and the ELN, including the Protocol in Case of a Rupture in Negotiations\".* Ecuador: President Len\u00edn Moreno lamented the death of Erika Chic\u00f3, the Ecuadorian cadet killed in the attack, and expressed his condolences to Colombia. He also announced that he was to send Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner to Bogot\u00e1 accompanied by Chic\u00f3's relatives.* Panama: The Panamanian embassy in Bogot\u00e1 expressed its indignation at the attack, and provided a phone number for information about Panamanian cadets affected.* United States: The Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Kimberly Breier condemned the bombing and said: \"Our condolences and sympathies go to the victims and family members of those killed\", while the U.S. Embassy in Bogot\u00e1 offered its \"help in investigating this reprehensible attack\".Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and the Organization of American States also condemned the attack.==References==", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Transportation driven

Well, here it is in black and white. It\u2019s an admission. They have got to do something with this information.\u201dThe Birmingham pub bombings - The 28 numbers that add up to a cover-up, say campaignersMr Conway, now a criminal lawyer in Dublin, says in the book that where off-duty soldiers were the targets of bombings \u201cI had little sympathy for either the soldiers or the unfortunate civilians who had been sharing their drinking space.\u201dHe continued: \u201cThe Birmingham bombs were another matter.\"The bombings came after British police disrupted funeral arrangements for James McDade, a volunteer who had himself died in a premature explosion in England.\u201cTempers were high and I, for one, certainly at first feared that the local IRA had knowingly caused these dreadful casualties \u2013 21 people were killed and a great many others injured.\u201d\u201cI was appalled and personally ashamed of the bombing, which went against everything we claimed to stand for.\u201dHe said he told two other senior IRA figures, Dave O\u2019Connell and Kevin Mallon \u201cexactly what I thought\u201d when they met up.\u201cIn fact, both men were themselves furious, fully recognising not just the damage the bombing had caused to the IRA but its immorality as well.\u201dMcDade, a lieutenant in the Birmingham Brigade of the IRA, blew himself up while trying to plant a bomb at Coventry Telephone exchange a week before the pub bombings.Neither The Mulberry Bush nor The Tavern in The Town had any military connection.Normal IRA procedure at the time for any attack on non-military targets was to give a 30-minute warning in order for full evacuations to take place.Read our docudrama minute-by-minute recreation of the events of November 21 1974The Birmingham Mail received an ambiguous call at 8.11pm on November 21. The caller did not identify either pub, referring instead to The Rotunda, above The Mulberry Bush and the New Street Tax Office, which was above the underground Tavern in The Town.The first bomb destroyed The Mulberry Bush just six minutes later. The Tavern was destroyed at 8.27pm.Conway was not directly involved in the debrief with the England Operational Commander.But he said he was later told \u201cthat the early indications were that the casualties were the result of yet another failure in the warning system, a succession of phone boxes from which the warning might have been relayed having proved to be inoperable.\u201dIn an interview with a national newspaper he described the Birmingham pub bombings as \u201ca total disaster.\u201dHe added that the secret \u2018Feakle Talks\u2019, held a couple of weeks after the bombings, were used by the IRA to try to start to repair its image after the Birmingham and the Guildford pub bombings.The talks, in Feakle, County Clare, involved senior IRA officials and Protestant clergymen and ended abruptly after a tip-off that Irish Special Branch officers were on their way to arrest the republicans.But they set in train a process that eventually led to a brief ceasefire that began on December 22, 1974.Conway had been recruited in 1970, having been radicalised during the 1968 student protest movements.He met with senior republicans, including future deputy first minister of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness and Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams.Adams continues to deny that he was ever in the IRA.Conway was later jailed in Belfast\u2019s notorious Crumlin Road prison and went on hunger strike to achieve political status.Although he left the IRA in 1975, he rejoined during the 1981 hunger strike, then finally broke with the republican movement for good in 1993 when the British and Irish governments announced the Downing Street Declaration.He claimed the declaration basically reinforced partition.\u201cThe IRA went on ceasefire, it decommissioned and did all the things they said they would never do, and disappeared into history,\u201d he said.\u201cIt was a complete and utter defeat, absolutely.\u201dIn his book he also claims that rogue Irish police officers colluded with the IRA throughout the Troubles and that members of the Dublin establishment, including several mainstream politicians, aided the Provisionals in their armed campaign.* Southside

{"text": "(NaturalNews) The socialist \"revolution\" against democracy and free markets is proceeding in Venezuela, with the authoritarian government downplaying a mysterious disease outbreak as print media in the country slowly dies off.As reported by WPLG'sin Miami, there have been at least 10 deaths from the as-yet-unidentified disease. The deaths have occurred in several Venezuelan cities, including the capital of Caracas. As it spreads, the disease is creating panic among the population and has led some of the nation's physicians to sound the alarm.However, as WPLG reported, the warnings are being downplayed by the socialist government:However, though the government remains in denial mode, doctors in Venezuela are taking the threat seriously; they say there is genuine reason for concern, especially in a country where government policies have created nightmarish shortages of everything from basic food supplies to medicines. Plus, they say the disease is both dangerous and contagious.\"We do not know what it is,\" Duglas Leon Natera, president of the Venezuelan Medical Federation, said, according to WPLG.At first, those infected present with a fever and spots on the skin, which then produce large blisters followed by internal and external bleeding, says data provided by the College of Physicians in the state of Aragua, where the first cases were seen.From that point, the disease progresses very quickly; patients begin suffering from respiratory failure, then kidney failure. And thus far, Venezuelan doctors have not been able to figure out what they are dealing with, let alone a treatment plan.And the government is hindering the process, largely by denying that there even is \"a mysterious disease ,\" because that's what dictatorial, socialist leaders do: claim infallibility and blame others. One official called the doctors' information nothing but a \"media campaign against Venezuela .\"And the governor of the state of Aragua, Tarek El-Aissami, along with Communications Minister Delcy Rodriguez, has labeled the warnings a \"defamatory\" strategy to \"distress to the population.\"Doctors are not completely in the dark; some have speculated on what the disease might be. Theories include a new type of very aggressive, severe dengue fever and a different version of Chikungunya fever; some have even suggested that it could be Ebola.Meanwhile, as its people die, so, too, does Venezuela's ability to inform its people; the country's print media is slowing dying too, suffering from a lack of newsprint, as WPLG reported:According to a newly released report by the Institute for Press and Society of Venezuela, or IPYS, 34 newspapers and magazines in 11 states have reported in the past year chronic shortages and difficulties acquiring supplies and other materials to print, such as ink, film and plates.The situation has been made worse by the government's strict controls on acquiring foreign exchange, as well as interference in the internal processes of suppliers. An exchange rate control was enacted in the country 11 years ago; it required companies to apply for permits in order to purchase foreign currency and import goods. And newspaper owners have been saying it has been months since they were granted permits to buy newsprint.\"Due to the impossibility of securing newsprint and print materials, 10 print outlets have stopped circulating altogether and four others have halted circulation temporarily,\" WPLG reported. \"Others have reduced the number of pages per edition, sometimes by more than half, or stopped running during the weekend in order to survive.\"In fact, the report said, the oldest Venezuelan daily,, nearly shuttered recently.\"The newspaper industry is in a coma in Venezuela,\" the paper's president, Carlos Eduardo Carmona, said. \"The government is slowly killing the free press in Venezuela.\"As for the doctors who tried to warn the public? Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has ordered them prosecuted for \"a scheme of alarm, of psychological terrorism.\"", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak outbreak <extra_id_0> Place Venezuela <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Disease disease <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact sound  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die die  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact inform  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Kyrgyzstan National Pleads Not Guilty to Hampering Boston Bomb ProbeBOSTON \u2014\u00a0A citizen of Kyrgyzstan on Wednesday pleaded not guilty to charges of lying to federal investigators about his ties to the two ethnic Chechen men accused of carrying out the Boston Marathon bombing.Khairullozhon Matanov, 23, faces one criminal count of destroying records and three counts of lying to officials in a terrorism investigation. He is not charged with taking part in the April 15, 2013, attack, which killed three people and injured more than 260.Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler ordered Matanov held until trial, after his attorney noted that it was unclear how the man would support himself after losing his job as a taxi driver following his arrest.She left open the option for his lawyer to seek his pretrial release if he were to find living arrangements.Matanov's involvementAn FBI agent who had worked on his case acknowledged under cross-examination by defense attorney Edward Hayden that Matanov, who lived in Quincy, Massachusetts, had shown up at a local police station the morning of April 19, 2013, while a manhunt was under way for suspected bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, to identify the man, but that the FBI had not interviewed him until the next day.Hayden noted that charging papers pointed out that Matanov had dinner with the suspected bombers, Dzhokhar and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the night of the attack and discussed the incident. Hayden asked FBI Special Agent Timothy McElroy undercross-examination if there was any evidence that Matanov at the time had suspected the Tsarnaevs of being involved in the attack.\"There's nothing in here, no,\" said McElroy, consulting court papers.Pending chargesProsecutors said Matanov deleted searches related to the attacks from his computer and tried to dispose of cell phones he described as illegal after the FBI released photos of the suspected bombers on April 18, 2013.Matanov was brought into court on Wednesday handcuffed and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit. His attorney said he entered the United States in 2010 on a student visa and was later granted political asylum due to ethnic clashes in his native Kyrgyzstan.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, is being held in a federal prison west of Boston awaiting trial on charges that carry the threat of execution if he is convicted. Tamerlan, 26, died after a gunfight with police three days after the bombing.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle destroying  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim 260 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing trial  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact interviewed  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ReleaseParole release  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Questions have been raised in recent days about the political and religious beliefs of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bombing suspect killed in a gunfight with police in the early hours of Friday.Anecdotes suggest that Tamerlan became more religious in the last several years and may have embraced more conservative Islamic ideas, although no link has been established between him and any known terrorist group.On Monday, a spokesman for the Islamic Society of Boston, a Cambridge mosque frequented by Tamerlan, contributed to the emerging debate over the suspect\u2019s religious beliefs by sharing an anecdote from a January talk at the mosque, during which Tamerlan disrupted the event and insulted the speaker, accusing him of deviating from Islam by comparing the Prophet Muhammad to Martin Luther King Jr.It was the second time that Tamerlan disrupted an event at the mosque because he felt that its religious message was too liberal, said the spokesman, Yusufi Vali, according to a report in The Boston Globe.In disrupting the talk in January at the Islamic Society of Boston mosque in Cambridge, Tamerlan Tsarnaev\u2019s shouted at a speaker: \u201cYou are a Kafir\u201d \u2014 a nonbeliever, according to Yusufi Vali, a spokesman for the mosque.Tsarnaev went on to say the speaker was contaminating people\u2019s minds and accused him of being a hypocrite.The congregation disagreed, according to Vali, and \u201cshouted him out of the mosque\u201d on Prospect Street.Tsarnaev also interrupted a talk last November when a speaker said it was fine for people to celebrate holidays such as Thanksgiving and July 4, in the same way you celebrate the birthday of the Prophet.Tsarnaev challenged him and the two talked after service.\u201cThe brother was angry, but he left,\u2019\u2019 Vali said.The Islamic Society of Boston issued a news release on Monday afternoon detailing the organization\u2019s interactions with the suspects, who it said were \u201cneither members nor regular attendees\u201d of religious services there.The statement focused almost exclusively on Tamerlan, who the organization said had begun coming \u201cintermittently\u201d to weekly Friday Prayers and \u201coccasionally\u201d to daily services about a year ago.It said Dzhokhar \u201cwas rarely seen at the center, coming only occasionally for prayer.\u201dThe statement included lengthy descriptions of the incidents in January and November when Tamerlan disrupted events at the mosque, leading the community there to reprimand and ostracize him.On November 16, 2012, at our weekly congregational prayer, one of our preachers sermonized that it was appropriate to celebrate national holidays like July 4th and Thanksgiving, just like the birthday of the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him).The older suspect stood up during the sermon and challenged the preacher, arguing that celebration of any holiday was not allowed in the faith.After the sermon ended and the congregational prayer was finished, the preacher met with the older suspect to share his opinion.The suspect repeatedly argued his viewpoint, and then left.On January 18, 2013, one of our preachers noted that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a great person remembered in history.The older suspect stood up, shouted and called him a \u201cnonbeliever\u201d; said that he was \u201ccontaminating people\u2019s minds\u201d; and began calling him a hypocrite.People of the congregation, in turn, shouted back at the older suspect, \u201cLeave now!\u201d Due to the congregation\u2019s disapproval, he left the sermon.After the sermon and the congregational prayer ended, a few volunteer leaders of the mosque sat down with the older suspect and gave him a clear choice: either he stops interrupting sermons and remains silent or he would not be welcomed.While he continued to attend some of the congregational prayers after the January incident, he neither interrupted another sermon nor did he cause any other disturbances.The statement said that no member of the mosque\u2019s board or staff \u201cever interacted\u201d with either Dzhokhar or Tamerlan, who it said \u201cdisagreed with the moderate American-Islamic theology of the I.S.B.Cambridge mosque.\u201d\u201cOur mosque is one filled with attendees who are teachers, businessmen, doctors and lawyers, all of whom are committed to the public good,\u201d the statement said.\u201cWhile these suspects did express views counter to our mosque\u2019s philosophy, they never expressed any hint of violent sentiments or behavior.If they had, the F.B.I.would have immediately been called.\u201dOn Saturday, the mosque posted a long note on its front door, which was photographed and uploaded to Twitter by several people, including Steve Annear, a freelance journalist and contributor to Boston Magazine.Here is the note about the bombing suspects on the door of the Islamic Society of Boston.They were guest s there.//t.co/vdv1ZWxagi \u2014 Steve Annear (@steveannear) 21 Apr 13The note expressed shock and sadness at the bombing of the Boston Marathon and urged members of the congregation to contact the F.B.I.with any information they may have about the Tsarnaev brothers.The statement was also posted on the mosque\u2019s Web site.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Tamerlan Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Boston Marathon <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact contributed <extra_id_0> Participant spokesman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Cambridge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic beliefs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Tsarnaev <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Prophet <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact issued <extra_id_0> Communicator Islamic Society of Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact posted <extra_id_0> Communicator mosque <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Steve Annear <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic note <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "Venezuela crisis: Maduro to raise fuel prices to combat smugglingVenezuela\u2019s heavily subsidised domestic fuel prices should rise to international levels to avoid billions of dollars in annual losses as a result of smuggling, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has said in a televised address.\"Gasoline must be sold at an international price to stop smuggling to Colombia and the Caribbean,\" the president said.Like most oil-producing countries, Venezuela has for decades subsidised fuel as a benefit to consumers.But its fuel prices have remained nearly flat for years despite hyperinflation that the International Monetary Fund has projected would reach 1 million per cent this year.That means that for the price of a cup of coffee, a driver can fill the tank of a small SUV nearly 9,000 times.Recently, the average price of a coffee with milk was 2.2m bolivars, or about 50 cents, local media has reported.Smugglers do brisk business reselling fuel in neighbouring countries.Quick guideWhy is Venezuela in crisis?Show Hide Under the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who ushered in Venezuela\u2019s socialist revolution in 1999, a new constitution and numerous elections placed nearly all government institutions under the control of the ruling Socialist party.This concentration of power was aided by a feuding opposition which carried out ineffectual campaigns and electoral boycotts.After Ch\u00e1vez died of cancer in 2013, he was succeeded by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro who is even less tolerant of dissent.Growing political authoritarianism has coincided with greater state dominance over the economy.But expropriations, price controls and mismanagement have led to a 40% contraction of the economy in the past five years.Oil accounts for 96% of Venezuela\u2019s export income but many foreign companies have been driven out and production has dropped to a 30-year low.The resulting fiscal crisis has prompted the government to print more money, which has led to hyperinflation and a collapse of the currency.It also means that the government can\u2019t import enough food and medicine to meet demand.Maduro has rejected economic reforms out of loyalty to socialism and because many government officials are allegedly getting rich off the economic distortions \u2013 through exchange rate scams and by selling scarce food on the black market.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Maduro said the government would still provide direct subsidies to citizens holding the \"fatherland card\", a state-issued identification card that the government uses to provide bonuses and track use of social services.He said the subsidy was only available to those who registered their cars in a vehicle census being conducted by the state.Venezuela has dirt-cheap fuel, so why is driving nearly impossible?Read moreOn Friday, the UN said that more than half a million Venezuelans had crossed into Ecuador this year as part of one of the largest mass migrations in Latin American history.About 547,000 citizens have entered Ecuador since January \u2013 mostly through its northern border with Colombia \u2013 to escape rampant crime and political violence, a collapsing economy and severe shortages of food and medicines.More than 1 million Venezuelans have also crossed into Colombia since the exodus began in 2015.Others have fanned out across Latin American and Caribbean nations including Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Trindad and Tobago.Tens of thousands have hiked into Brazil down a remote Amazon road known as the Hunger Highway.",

{"text": "Government opponents are begging Venezuelans to sit out a vote on Sunday for what they see as a puppet congress and the last step toward dictatorship in this South American country. But Jos\u00e9, a Caracas bus driver, said he and other public transit employees were given an ultimatum by their bosses.Turn out and vote for the new congress, in an election in which nearly every candidate is a supporter of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.Or else.\u201cThey\u2019re obliging us to vote,\u201d said the young father of two, who declined to give his last name, fearing repercussions. \u201cIf not, they\u2019ll fire us, and what are we going to do without a job?\u201dVenezuela is not yet the kind of dictatorship that once proliferated in Latin America \u2014 with rulers who \u201cdisappeared\u201d opponents, banned books and movies, and ran mass torture centers. Government pressure and violence against journalists have drastically curbed the press, but digital media outlets thrive. Hundreds of political prisoners are in jail, according to human rights groups, but opposition leaders continue to forcefully speak out. This month, the government allowed one major critic \u2014 Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, the former mayor of Caracas \u2014 to exchange his jail cell for house arrest.1 of 46 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Protesters clash with Venezuelan security forces View Photos Thousands have been arrested, and many allege mistreatment.

Aug. 7, 2017 Pro-government supporters holding Venezuela\u2019s flag march in Caracas. Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.Yet on Sunday, critics say, an authoritarian system long in the making will be formalized, reviving memories of an era that the region had hoped was over. In defiance of international warnings, the socialist government is pushing forward with a vote to elect a constituent assembly that will have the authority to change the 1999 constitution, supplant the opposition-controlled legislature and potentially keep Maduro in power indefinitely.The opposition on Thursday called for three days of massive, nationwide protests as the government showed no willingness to back down and following the slaying of seven more demonstrators in two days. Responding to the spiraling tensions, the U.S. State Department ordered the departure of family members of American staff at its embassy in Caracas. It also authorized voluntary departures for American staff, and issued a broad travel warning for U.S. citizens.Maduro \u2014 the anointed successor of firebrand leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who died in 2013 \u2014 strongly defends the new assembly, saying it will fortify what he hails as \u201cthe communal state.\u201d While it\u2019s unclear exactly what he is seeking in a new constitution, it would likely give more power to \u201ccommunal councils\u201d in poor neighborhoods. Leaders of those councils, critics say, are government loyalists who in practice would sideline elected politicians and win direct pipelines to government funds.On the surface, the assembly vote, along with the government\u2019s pseudo-Soviet speak, hark back to old-school Marxist regimes. But many here see something perhaps more sinister emerging \u2014 a 21st-century thugocracy that rules by coercion, extortion and violence.About 100 people have died in three months of anti-government street protests. Arrests of political activists have accelerated. Bands of pro-government toughs \u2014 known as colectivos \u2014 roam poor neighborhoods, waving guns, intimidating protesters and journalists, beating opposition politicians, and warning locals to toe the government line.[How a new kind of protest movement has arisen in Venezuela]More than 7 million people voted against the establishment of the new assembly in an informal referendum July 16. Opposition parties are boycotting the election.In a country where the government is the largest employer, state workers say they are being ordered to vote Sunday, at the risk of losing their jobs. HIV patients say officials have threatened to cut off their supplies of antiretroviral drugs if they do not turn out for the election. Families risk being scratched off government food distribution rosters for not showing up \u2014 a dire outcome in a country where a socialist experiment and economic mismanagement have sparked hyperinflation and food shortages.Such threats are not idle, either. Yanelis Banco, 36 years old and nearly nine months pregnant, said her boss at the government postal service called her in along with other department heads for a talk last week. He ordered them, she said, to sign a form pledging to vote Sunday.She and five other senior staffers refused. All of them lost their jobs, she said.\u201cI\u2019m a pregnant woman who has been working in the company for 10 years and four months, so I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d fire me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do I have to sign if I don\u2019t agree? I thought the law protected me!\u201dShe added: \u201cAll the other employees are terrified. Now they\u2019re sure that if they don\u2019t vote, they\u2019ll be fired. None of them can afford that.\u201d[Stuck in a death spiral, Venezuela is borrowing money at any cost]Maduro has acknowledged that the government is pressuring public employees to vote. At a rally with public energy workers this month, he said: \u201cTake the lists of workers from all the state institutions and businesses to create a constituent committee. For each business, call all the workers and organize how they\u2019ll vote on July 30th. At the end of the day, check the list. If there are 15,000 workers, there have to be 15,000 votes, with no excuses.\u201dVenezuela\u2019s political protests have been fueled by the disastrous state of the economy, growing authoritarian rule and the government\u2019s resistance to early elections. The country\u2019s electoral council ruled against the opposition when it sought a referendum in 2016 that could have cut short Maduro\u2019s six-year term. The council also pushed back elections for governors, scheduled for 2016, to December of this year. Critics fear that the new assembly will cancel those, as well as the presidential election in 2018.The U.S. Treasury Department in February froze Vice President Tareck El Aissami\u2019s American assets over his alleged involvement in narcotics trafficking and took similar action against eight justices of the pro-government supreme court after it tried to strip power from the opposition-led legislature. On Wednesday, the Trump administration targeted 13 more Venezuelan officials, alleging violations of human rights and corruption.[Trump administration hits 13 Venezuelans with sanctions in advance of vote]Once the richest country per capita in South America due to its vast oil reserves, Venezuela was also cursed with vast disparities that kept an elite in luxury while the poor languished in slums. The result was Ch\u00e1vez, who used the petroleum wealth to launch massive social programs, even as he concentrated power. He remains much beloved by millions of Venezuelans, although many others \u2014 especially in the middle and upper classes \u2014 loathe him.Maduro\u2019s approval rating, on the other hand, is hovering around 20 percent, with opponents calling this weekend\u2019s vote the only way for him to remain in the presidential palace.He has promised Venezuelans that the assembly will herald a new era of security and stability.\u201cJuly 30th will be the birth of a historic trigger of the homeland for a new phase of peace and advancement,\u201d Maduro told a campaign rally this week.Yet many Venezuelans fear just the opposite \u2014 a deepening of official repression. It is already starting, they say.Take, for instance, 51-year-old Lisbeth A\u00f1ez, or \u201cMama Lis.\u201d For years, she was known for aiding anti-government protesters, bringing them blankets and cooking them fresh arepas, or cornmeal cakes.In May, she was arrested and charged with treason.Her case is in the hands of a military tribunal. In recent months, scores of civilians who have taken part in demonstrations or other perceived anti-government acts have been sent into the military court system, where they can face lengthy prison sentences.\u201cI can\u2019t sleep, I can\u2019t eat, even if we had enough food,\u201d said her son, Luis Gonz\u00e1lez A\u00f1ez, 23, who said he was refused entry to her trial. \u201cI have nightmares, thinking about her in jail . . . I didn\u2019t think things could get worse, but they have.\u201dGabriela Ram\u00edrez, Venezuela\u2019s former public ombudsman and a longtime Ch\u00e1vez supporter, said she feared the government would become worse than a dictatorship. \u201cWe will have a narco-authoritarian regime,\u201d she said.Ram\u00edrez, who carries around a pocket version of Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s 1999 constitution in her purse, is among the ranks of former \u201cChavistas\u201d \u2014 or Ch\u00e1vez backers \u2014 who have turned against Maduro. She has paid for it with harassment, she said, including a recent hack in which intimate photos of her and her husband were leaked on social media.\u201cThere will no longer be any check on their power,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will control everything.\u201dFollowing an opposition-called 48-hour strike, the government on Thursday issued a ban on public gatherings and protests lasting from Friday through Tuesday. The opposition responded by calling for nationwide mobilization, asking citizens to take to the streets from the Caribbean Sea to the Andes Mountains.In an interview, Freddy Guevara, an opposition leader and vice president of the National Assembly, played down the chances of any deal to suspend or cancel the vote. Former Spanish prime minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero is in Caracas, and has served as an intermediary between the government and opposition. Guevara denied reports that a deal had been offered to suspend the vote.\u201cIt is wishful thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cI am sure they are going forward with this scam, and that we are going to respond with pressure.\u201dBut even leading members of the opposition appear to be losing hope that Maduro will back down.Scenarios for what happens next range widely. Some observers suggest that social unrest and international sanctions will worsen, prompting, perhaps, a military coup or fueling an anti-government guerrilla movement. Others say the government, likely with the aid of Russia and China, will somehow manage to hold on as the country becomes an international pariah.Still others see a worst-case scenario of social implosion and anarchy.\u201cSomalia,\u201d said Henrique Capriles, an opposition leader and governor of the state of Miranda.\u201cWe could become a failed state.\u201dMariana Zu\u00f1iga contributed to this report.Read moreThings are so bad in Venezuela that people are rationing toothpasteVenezuela\u2019s paradox: people are hungry, but farmers can\u2019t feed themMaduro wants to rewrite the constitution.

{"text": "SANTIAGO, CHILE - A former top Venezuelan security official says video reports from Sunday's drone attack on President Nicolas Maduro demonstrate serious shortcomings in the response of the bodyguards protecting the increasingly embattled leader.\"Maduro's security was shown to be deficient,\" said retired Venezuelan Vice Admiral Mario Carratu, who has headed security teams for previous Venezuelan presidents, in a telephone interview with VOA. \"His bodyguards were slow to react and seemed to lack an evacuation plan for the president.\"Carratu said video of the incident, in which two drones exploded near a reviewing stand without injuring Maduro, suggested the president's security detail did not have an effective evacuation plan in place.The former admiral's analysis dovetails with public comments from disaffected former Venezuelan military officers who have gone public with claims to have been responsible for the assassination attempt.\"We showed that the regime is vulnerable. We didn't make it, but it's a matter of time before we do,\" said Salvatore Lucchese, a former Caracas police chief now in exile.Venezuelan opposition activist Salvatore Lucchese Venezuelan opposition activist Salvatore Lucchese speaks during an interview with Reuters in Bogota, Colombia Aug. 6, 2018. Venezuelan opposition activist Salvatore Lucchese speaks during an interview with Reuters in Bogota, Colombia Aug. 6, 2018.Lucchese claimed to have been part of the plot in an interview with Reuters this week in which he called for an armed overthrow of Maduro's leftist regime.Maduro was addressing a ceremony of the paramilitary National Guard in central Caracas when he came under attack from two drones packed with explosives. The government claims that one of the drones was diverted electronically while the second crashed into a nearby apartment building.Carratu confirmed that Venezuela, a longtime ally of Cuba, has the technology to electronically penetrate and interfere with the electronic signals of aircraft. But he ridiculed claims made on Twitter by persons saying they were involved in the attack that the drones had been shot down with firearms.\"Plastic explosives can't be detonated with bullets. They more likely exploded prematurely due to poor preparations by the hit team,\" he said.Lucchese's claim of responsibility for the attack came Wednesday but could not be independently confirmed. Responsibility has been claimed by a confusing array of spokesmen purporting to represent former and active members of Venezuela's security services, going by various names including \"The Resistance,\" \"Fenix Group\" and \"Soldiers in T Shirts.\"Lucchese was jailed by the Venezuelan government in 2014 for refusing orders to suppress opposition protests in his city. He took up political activity upon his release in 2016, when he objected to political negotiations with Maduro, but fled the country shortly afterward to avoid being arrested again.He did not reveal his location in the Reuters interview, but members of the Venezuelan government assert that he is in neighboring Colombia, a country that Maduro accuses of backing attempts to topple him.Exiled Venezuelan opposition journalist Patricia Poleo, long known for her close connections with the military, broadcast a statement from Miami that she claimed had been issued by officers in Venezuela. It said the officers were resorting to \"armed struggle\" because \"the regime has consistently ignored the constitution.\"Some opposition leaders have cast doubts on the claims of responsibility, suggesting instead that the attack was staged by the government to justify further repression.Julio Borges, president of the Venezuelan parliame Julio Borges, president of the Venezuelan parliament, arrives for a meeting with Ernesto Macias, president of Colombia's Senate, at the Congress in Bogota, Colombia, Aug. 8, 2018. Julio Borges, president of the Venezuelan parliament, arrives for a meeting with Ernesto Macias, president of Colombia's Senate, at the Congress in Bogota, Colombia, Aug. 8, 2018.The Maduro government this week has rounded up a half dozen military officers it accused of conducting the attacks and has issued arrest warrants for at least two opposition leaders, including congressional Speaker Julio Borges, who is in Colombia.Lucchese's police background crisscrossed with that of police lnspector Oscar Perez,who last year attacked Venezuela's Supreme Court from a helicopter with hand grenades and machine-gun fire. The attack came as the court's seven judges assumed the powers of parliament to allow Maduro to rule autocratically.Perez also machine-gunned a building housing Maduro's new handpicked national assembly, which had just ousted Attorney General Luisa Ortega for accusing Maduro of corruption and authoritarian rule.The Caracas metropolitan police, which has been largely dissolved by the Maduro government, maintained close links with opposition leaders. Lucchese was a member of the same Christian democratic First Justice party as Caracas Mayor Leopoldo Lopez, one of the most charismatic anti- government leaders who has been repeatedly imprisoned by Maduro.Perez was a subordinate to Lucchese in the police criminal investigations unit and the special operations brigade. He was killed by the new national secret police, SEBIN, whose forces used rocket-propelled grenades against his safe house when they raided it some months ago.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Crash crashed <extra_id_0> Vehicle second <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place apartment building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> CrashObject apartment building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target Nicolas Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> Target Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact broadcast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer SEBIN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> Instrument explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee opposition leaders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacked  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact meeting <extra_id_0> Participant Ernesto Macias <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact meeting <extra_id_0> Participant Ernesto Macias <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Had his homemade bomb gone off\u2014one he had diabolically constructed using shrapnel coated with a substance meant to keep blood from clotting in wounds\u2014Kevin Harpham would have undoubtedly caused the death and injury of many people at last year\u2019s Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Unity March in Spokane, Washington.Instead, Harpham was eventually caught and recently sentenced to 32 years in prison for a hate crime and other offenses related to the attempted bombing. The case illustrates how a quick response by citizens and local law enforcement averted a tragedy and how teamwork and time-tested investigative techniques led to the apprehension of an individual who has shown no remorse for his actions.\u201cClearly he intended to detonate the device, cause mass carnage, and then survey the devastation,\u201d said Special Agent Frank Harrill, who supervised the investigation. \u201cHarpham was acting out against what he termed multiculturalism, but his hatred was firmly rooted in violent white supremacy. This was a prototypical hate crime.\u201dOn January 17, 2011, as hundreds of people gathered in downtown Spokane to participate in the march, Harpham placed his backpack bomb along the parade route at Washington Street and Main Avenue. Alert city workers discovered the suspicious backpack before the march started, and Spokane Police Department officials changed the route as a precaution. The Spokane Police and Sheriff\u2019s Office bomb squad was called in, and their precision in disarming the device enabled evidence to be preserved that would help lead FBI agents to Harpham.The FBI\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) in Spokane immediately began an investigation, and JTTF members canvassed the region for batteries and other components similar to those used in the bomb. Within a month, in a small town about 60 miles north of Spokane, they discovered that a local outlet of a large retail chain was selling the same kind of fishing weights Harpham had used as shrapnel.Store records showed there had been three large purchases of the weights in recent months\u2014two were paid for in cash, but a debit card was used in one transaction, and it belonged to Harpham. At the same time, the FBI Laboratory had been working to extract a DNA sample from the backpack that was later matched to Harpham through his military records.Investigators also learned of Harpham\u2019s white supremacy postings on the Internet and his affiliation with a neo-Nazi group called the National Alliance.Because he lived in a remote, relatively inaccessible area and was likely heavily armed, our Hostage Rescue Team devised a ruse to lure Harpham out of his house. He was arrested March 9, 2011 without incident\u2014but as agents suspected, he was armed when taken into custody.\u201cKevin Harpham was the lone wolf that all of us in law enforcement dread,\u201d Harrill said. \u201cHe lived alone, he worked alone, and he didn\u2019t foreshadow the bombing plot in any meaningful way. He targeted those who were attempting to celebrate an event meant to unite society,\u201d Harrill added, \u201cand he was prepared to indiscriminately kill men, women, and children.\u201dHarrill credited teamwork and strong partnerships for stopping Harpham and bringing him to justice. \u201cFrom the workers who noticed the device to the police response, the JTTF investigation, the expertise of the FBI Laboratory, and the prosecuting skill of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office\u2014everything worked just as it should have.\u201dResources:- Washington Man Sentenced to 32 Years (12/20/2011)- Attempted Bomber Pleads Guilty (09/07/2011)- Attempted Bomber Arrested (03/09/2011)", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentenced <extra_id_0> Defendant Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime offenses  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain caught <extra_id_0> Detainee Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain Arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Bomber <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence Sentenced <extra_id_0> Defendant Man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle disarming <extra_id_0> Artifact device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Disabler squad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Harrill <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Kevin Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonate <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Frank Harrill <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator Joint Terrorism Task Force <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Victim children <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact added <extra_id_0> Participant Harrill <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ImpedeInterfereWith stopping  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict Pleads Guilty <extra_id_0> Defendant Bomber <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack gone off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice his homemade bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble constructed <extra_id_0> Artifact one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components substance <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die death <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injury <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate march <extra_id_0> Demonstrator people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell purchases <extra_id_0> PaymentBarter debit card <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact postings <extra_id_0> Participant Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic white supremacy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection discovered <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity backpack <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Observer workers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate march  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
