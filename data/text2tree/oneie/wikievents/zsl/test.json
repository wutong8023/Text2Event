{"text": "Teaching student jailed over Sweden terror plotThe 20-year-old and his lawyer.Photo: Janerik Henriksson/TTA 20-year-old former teaching student has been locked up for five years for plotting a suicide attack in Sweden.Aydin Sevigin was arrested in February, suspected of having tried to build a bomb.Police found six bottles of aceton, duct tape, a mobile phone and bullets during a search of his home.A receipt for Christmas tree lights and surveillance footage showing him buying a pressure cooker from Ikea were also part of the case.The 20-year-old, who grew up in the well-off suburb Danderyd north of Stockholm, denied the claims, but refused to explain why he bought the ingredients, which can be used to build bombs.\"My opinion is that he acquired, stored and collected liquids and objects to make and then blow up a suicide bomb in order to become a martyr.The criminal act being prepared could seriously have hurt Sweden,\" prosecutor Ewamari H\u00e4ggkvist said ahead of the verdict.Attunda District Court, north of Stockholm, sentenced him to five years in jail on Thursday morning for \"preparing to commit a terror crime\".It said it had reduced the sentence by one year because he is aged under 21.\"It is not clear what would have been the target of a bomb attack.But we believe that blowing up a shrapnel bomb of this kind would have been able to harm Sweden and that the purpose of such a bomb must have been to instil fear in the way referred to by terrorism legislation,\" said the chairman of the court, Mikael Swahn, in a statement.Sevigin's relatives had raised the alarm several months before he was arrested.In June last year one of his family members called the police, saying he was concerned about the 20-year-old, who had then disappeared.He was shortly thereafter stopped in Turkey on two occasions.The first time he was made to return to Greece, the second time he was flown back to Sweden from Istanbul.His intention is believed to have been to travel onwards to Syria to join Isis.Several of his relatives stated during the investigation and trial that the 20-year-old had been experiencing symptoms of depression, isolating himself from others and expressing radical opinions sympathizing with Isis.It was not immediately known if his legal team would attempt to appeal the sentence.The verdict came on the same day as a separate terror trial got under way in Sweden.A 25-year-old man is charged with attempting to travel to Syria to join a militant group.The trial is the first of its kind applying Sweden's new anti-terror laws making it illegal to travel abroad to join terror organizations.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain jailed <extra_id_0> Detainee Teaching student <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer Sweden <extra_id_1>

{"text": "Investigation of the Belated Production of Documents in the Oklahoma City Bombing Case\"The bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on April 19, 1995, was, at the time, the most significant act of terrorism that had ever taken place in the United States. Government agencies, led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), immediately began an extensive investigation to identify and prosecute the culprits. The investigation, known as OKBOMB, was run by a Task Force that consisted primarily of FBI investigators and support personnel and Department of Justice prosecutors. Within a few months, three individuals-Timothy McVeigh, Terry Nichols, and Michael Fortier-were indicted for crimes relating to the bombing. McVeigh and Nichols were convicted after trials, and Fortier pled guilty as part of a plea agreement with the government. McVeigh, who had devised the plot to bomb the Murrah Building and had planted the bomb, was sentenced to death. On May 8, 2001, one week before McVeigh's scheduled execution date, the Department of Justice and the FBI revealed to McVeigh's and Nichols' attorneys that over 700 investigative documents had not been disclosed to the defendants before their trials. The government acknowledged that it had violated a discovery order in the case, and the Attorney General stayed McVeigh's execution for one month in order to resolve the legal issues arising from the belated disclosure. Following the public revelation of the problem, and after finding and releasing more than 300 additional OKBOMB documents to the defense, the FBI came under severe criticism for its handling of the OKBOMB documents.\"United States.

{"text": "Despite President Barack Obama\u2019s recent call to reduce the United States\u2019 reliance on drones, they will likely remain his administration\u2019s weapon of choice. Whereas President George W. Bush oversaw fewer than 50 drone strikes during his tenure, Obama has signed off on over 400 of them in the last four years, making the program the centerpiece of U.S. counterterrorism strategy. The drones have done their job remarkably well: by killing key leaders and denying terrorists sanctuaries in Pakistan, Yemen, and, to a lesser degree, Somalia, drones have devastated al Qaeda and associated anti-American militant groups. And they have done so at little financial cost, at no risk to U.S. forces, and with fewer civilian casualties than many alternative methods would have caused.Critics, however, remain skeptical. They claim that drones kill thousands of innocent civilians, alienate allied governments, anger foreign publics, illegally target Americans, and set a dangerous precedent that irresponsible governments will abuse. Some of these criticisms are valid; others, less so. In the end, drone strikes remain a necessary instrument of counterterrorism. The United States simply cannot tolerate terrorist safe havens in remote parts of Pakistan and elsewhere, and drones offer a comparatively low-risk way of targeting these areas while minimizing collateral damage.So drone warfare is here to stay, and it is likely to expand in the years to come as other countries\u2019 capabilities catch up with those of the United States. But Washington must continue to improve its drone policy, spelling out clearer rules for extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings so that tyrannical regimes will have a harder time pointing to the U.S. drone program to justify attacks against political opponents. At the same time, even as it solidifies the drone program, Washington must remain mindful of the built-in limits of low-cost, unmanned interventions, since the very convenience of drone warfare risks dragging the United States into conflicts it could otherwise avoid.NOBODY DOES IT BETTERThe Obama administration relies on drones for one simple reason: they work. According to data compiled by the New America Foundation, since Obama has been in the White House, U.S. drones have killed an estimated 3,300 al Qaeda, Taliban, and other jihadist operatives in Pakistan and Yemen. That number includes over 50 senior leaders of al Qaeda and the Taliban\u2014top figures who are not easily replaced. In 2010, Osama bin Laden warned his chief aide, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, who was later killed by a drone strike in the Waziristan region of Pakistan in 2011, that when experienced leaders are eliminated, the result is \u201cthe rise of lower leaders who are not as experienced as the former leaders\u201d and who are prone to errors and miscalculations. And drones also hurt terrorist organizations when they eliminate operatives who are lower down on the food chain but who boast special skills: passport forgers, bomb makers, recruiters, and fundraisers.Drones have also undercut terrorists\u2019 ability to communicate and to train new recruits. In order to avoid attracting drones, al Qaeda and Taliban operatives try to avoid using electronic devices or gathering in large numbers. A tip sheet found among jihadists in Mali advised militants to \u201cmaintain complete silence of all wireless contacts\u201d and \u201cavoid gathering in open areas.\u201d Leaders, however, cannot give orders when they are incommunicado, and training on a large scale is nearly impossible when a drone strike could wipe out an entire group of new recruits. Drones have turned al Qaeda\u2019s command and training structures into a liability, forcing the group to choose between having no leaders and risking dead leaders.Critics of drone strikes often fail to take into account the fact that the alternatives are either too risky or unrealistic. To be sure, in an ideal world, militants would be captured alive, allowing authorities to question them and search their compounds for useful information. Raids, arrests, and interrogations can produce vital intelligence and can be less controversial than lethal operations. That is why they should be, and indeed already are, used in stable countries where the United States enjoys the support of the host government. But in war zones or unstable countries, such as Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia, arresting militants is highly dangerous and, even if successful, often inefficient. In those three countries, the government exerts little or no control over remote areas, which means that it is highly dangerous to go after militants hiding out there. Worse yet, in Pakistan and Yemen, the governments have at times cooperated with militants. If the United States regularly sent in special operations forces to hunt down terrorists there, sympathetic officials could easily tip off the jihadists, likely leading to firefights, U.S. casualties, and possibly the deaths of the suspects and innocent civilians.Of course, it was a Navy SEAL team and not a drone strike that finally got bin Laden, but in many cases in which the United States needs to capture or eliminate an enemy, raids are too risky and costly. And even if a raid results in a successful capture, it begets another problem: what to do with the detainee. Prosecuting detainees in a federal or military court is difficult because often the intelligence against terrorists is inadmissible or using it risks jeopardizing sources and methods. And given the fact that the United States is trying to close, rather than expand, the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, it has become much harder to justify holding suspects indefinitely. It has become more politically palatable for the United States to kill rather than detain suspected terrorists.Furthermore, although a drone strike may violate the local state\u2019s sovereignty, it does so to a lesser degree than would putting U.S. boots on the ground or conducting a large-scale air campaign. And compared with a 500-pound bomb dropped from an F-16, the grenadelike warheads carried by most drones create smaller, more precise blast zones that decrease the risk of unexpected structural damage and casualties. Even more important, drones, unlike traditional airplanes, can loiter above a target for hours, waiting for the ideal moment to strike and thus reducing the odds that civilians will be caught in the kill zone.Finally, using drones is also far less bloody than asking allies to hunt down terrorists on the United States\u2019 behalf. The Pakistani and Yemeni militaries, for example, are known to regularly torture and execute detainees, and they often indiscriminately bomb civilian areas or use scorched-earth tactics against militant groups.Some critics of the drone program, such as Ben Emmerson, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, have questioned the lethal approach, arguing for more focus on the factors that might contribute to extremism and terrorism, such as poverty, unemployment, and authoritarianism. Such a strategy is appealing in principle, but it is far from clear how Washington could execute it. Individuals join anti-American terrorist groups for many reasons, ranging from outrage over U.S. support for Israel to anger at their own government\u2019s cooperation with the United States. Some people simply join up because their neighbors are doing so. Slashing unemployment in Yemen, bringing democracy to Saudi Arabia, and building a functioning government in Somalia are laudable goals, but they are not politically or financially possible for the United States, and even if achieved, they still might not reduce the allure of jihad.In some cases, the most sensible alternative to carrying out drone strikes is to do nothing at all. At times, that is the right option: if militants abroad pose little threat or if the risk of killing civilians, delegitimizing allies, or establishing the wrong precedent is too high. But sometimes imminent and intolerable threats do arise and drone strikes are the best way to eliminate them.THE NUMBERS GAMEDespite the obvious benefits of using drones and the problems associated with the alternatives, numerous critics argue that drones still have too many disadvantages. First among them is an unacceptably high level of civilian casualties. Admittedly, drones have killed innocents. But the real debate is over how many and whether alternative approaches are any better. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reports that in 2011, drone strikes killed as many as 146 noncombatants, including as many as 9 children. Columbia Law School\u2019s Human Rights Clinic also cites high numbers of civilian deaths, as does the Pakistani organization Pakistan Body Count. Peter Bergen of the New America Foundation oversees a database of drone casualties culled from U.S. sources and international media reports. He estimates that between 150 and 500 civilians have been killed by drones during Obama\u2019s administration. U.S. officials, meanwhile, maintain that drone strikes have killed almost no civilians. In June 2011, John Brennan, then Obama\u2019s top counterterrorism adviser, even contended that U.S. drone strikes had killed no civilians in the previous year. But these claims are based on the fact that the U.S. government assumes that all military-age males in the blast area of a drone strike are combatants\u2014 unless it can determine after the fact that they were innocent (and such intelligence gathering is not a priority).The United States has recently taken to launching \u201csignature strikes,\u201d which target not specific individuals but instead groups engaged in suspicious activities. This approach makes it even more difficult to distinguish between combatants and civilians and verify body counts of each. Still, as one U.S. official told The New York Times last year, \u201cAl Qaeda is an insular, paranoid organization\u2014innocent neighbors don\u2019t hitchhike rides in the back of trucks headed for the border with guns and bombs.\u201d Of course, not everyone accepts this reasoning. Zeeshan-ul-hassan Usmani, who runs Pakistan Body Count, says that \u201cneither [the United States] nor Pakistan releases any detailed information about the victims . . . so [although the United States] likes to call everybody Taliban, I call everybody civilians.\u201dThe truth is that all the public numbers are unreliable. Who constitutes a civilian is often unclear; when trying to kill the Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud, for example, the United States also killed his doctor. The doctor was not targeting U.S. or allied forces, but he was aiding a known terrorist leader. In addition, most strikes are carried out in such remote locations that it is nearly impossible for independent sources to verify who was killed. In Pakistan, for example, the overwhelming majority of drone killings occur in tribal areas that lie outside the government\u2019s control and are prohibitively dangerous for Westerners and independent local journalists to enter. Thus, although the New America Foundation has come under fire for relying heavily on unverifiable information provided by anonymous U.S. officials, reports from local Pakistani organizations, and the Western organizations that rely on them, are no better: their numbers are frequently doctored by the Pakistani government or by militant groups. After a strike in Pakistan, militants often cordon off the area, remove their dead, and admit only local reporters sympathetic to their cause or decide on a body count themselves. The U.S. media often then draw on such faulty reporting to give the illusion of having used multiple sources. As a result, statistics on civilians killed by drones are often inflated. One of the few truly independent on-the-ground reporting efforts, conducted by the Associated Press last year, concluded that the strikes \u201care killing far fewer civilians than many in [Pakistan] are led to believe.\u201dBut even the most unfavorable estimates of drone casualties reveal that the ratio of civilian to militant deaths\u2014about one to three, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism\u2014is lower than it would be for other forms of strikes. Bombings by F-16s or Tomahawk cruise missile salvos, for example, pack a much more deadly payload. In December 2009, the United States fired Tomahawks at a suspected terrorist training camp in Yemen, and over 30 people were killed in the blast, most of them women and children. At the time, the Yemeni regime refused to allow the use of drones, but had this not been the case, a drone\u2019s real-time surveillance would probably have spotted the large number of women and children, and the attack would have been aborted. Even if the strike had gone forward for some reason, the drone\u2019s far smaller warhead would have killed fewer innocents. Civilian deaths are tragic and pose political problems. But the data show that drones are more discriminate than other types of force.FOREIGN FRIENDSIt is also telling that drones have earned the backing, albeit secret, of foreign governments. In order to maintain popular support, politicians in Pakistan and Yemen routinely rail against the U.S. drone campaign. In reality, however, the governments of both countries have supported it. During the Bush and Obama administrations, Pakistan has even periodically hosted U.S. drone facilities and has been told about strikes in advance. Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan until 2008, was not worried about the drone program\u2019s negative publicity: \u201cIn Pakistan, things fall out of the sky all the time,\u201d he reportedly remarked. Yemen\u2019s former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, also at times allowed drone strikes in his country and even covered for them by telling the public that they were conducted by the Yemeni air force. When the United States\u2019 involvement was leaked in 2002, however, relations between the two countries soured. Still, Saleh later let the drone program resume in Yemen, and his replacement, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has publicly praised drones, saying that \u201cthey pinpoint the target and have zero margin of error, if you know what target you\u2019re aiming at.\u201dAs officials in both Pakistan and Yemen realize, U.S. drone strikes help their governments by targeting common enemies. A memo released by the antisecrecy website WikiLeaks revealed that Pakistan\u2019s army chief, Ashfaq Parvez kayani, privately asked U.S. military leaders in 2008 for \u201ccontinuous Predator coverage\u201d over antigovernment militants, and the journalist Mark Mazzetti has reported that the United States has conducted \u201cgoodwill kills\u201d against Pakistani militants who threatened Pakistan far more than the United States. Thus, in private, Pakistan supports the drone program. As then Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani told Anne Patterson, then the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, in 2008, \u201cWe\u2019ll protest [against the drone program] in the National Assembly and then ignore it.\u201dStill, Pakistan is reluctant to make its approval public. First of all, the country\u2019s inability to fight terrorists on its own soil is a humiliation for Pakistan\u2019s politically powerful armed forces and intelligence service. In addition, although drones kill some of the government\u2019s enemies, they have also targeted pro-government groups that are hostile to the United States, such as the Haqqani network and the Taliban, which Pakistan has supported since its birth in the early 1990s. Even more important, the Pakistani public is vehemently opposed to U.S. drone strikes.A 2012 poll found that 74 percent of Pakistanis viewed the United States as their enemy, likely in part because of the ongoing drone campaign. Similarly, in Yemen, as the scholar Gregory Johnsen has pointed out, drone strikes can win the enmity of entire tribes. This has led critics to argue that the drone program is shortsighted: that it kills today\u2019s enemies but creates tomorrow\u2019s in the process.Such concerns are valid, but the level of local anger over drones is often lower than commonly portrayed. Many surveys of public opinion related to drones are conducted by anti-drone organizations, which results in biased samples. Other surveys exclude those who are unaware of the drone program and thus overstate the importance of those who are angered by it. In addition, many Pakistanis do not realize that the drones often target the very militants who are wreaking havoc on their country. And for most Pakistanis and Yemenis, the most important problems they struggle with are corruption, weak representative institutions, and poor economic growth; the drone program is only a small part of their overall anger, most of which is directed toward their own governments. A poll conducted in 2007, well before the drone campaign had expanded to its current scope, found that only 15 percent of Pakistanis had a favorable opinion of the United States. It is hard to imagine that alternatives to drone strikes, such as seal team raids or cruise missile strikes, would make the United States more popular.THE HOME FRONTStill, public opposition is real, and there is growing concern about the drone strikes even in the United States. The program came under especially heavy criticism domestically in 2011, when Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen born in New Mexico, was killed by a drone strike in Yemen. There is no question that Awlaki was dangerous. Adept at interspersing Islamist rhetoric with pop-culture references, Awlaki had been described as a \u201cpied piper for Western ears\u201d: one admirer was Nidal Malik Hasan, the U.S. Army officer who killed 13 U.S. soldiers at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009.The Obama administration claims that Awlaki was actively involved in plots against the United States and that the strike against him was legal under the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF), which Congress passed three days after 9/11 and which gives the president broad authority to use force against terrorist groups linked to the 9/11 attacks. Yet with the war on terrorism almost 12 years old and bin Laden dead, critics, such as the Georgetown University law professor Rosa Brooks, have begun questioning whether the AUMF still justifies drone strikes today. As Brooks has argued, \u201cMany of the groups now being identified as threats don\u2019t fall clearly under the AUMF\u2019s umbrella\u2014and many don\u2019t pose a significant danger to the United States.\u201d As for the case of Awlaki, opponents of his killing have argued that he did not pose an imminent threat to the United States and that in keeping the evidence used to justify his assassination secret, the administration violated the constitutional guarantee of due process for U.S. citizens. As Ron Paul, then a Texas representative, pointed out during his presidential campaign, Awlaki was never charged with any crime. He added, \u201cIf the American people accept this blindly and casually, that we now have an accepted practice of the president assassinating people who he thinks are bad guys, I think it\u2019s sad.\u201dThe administration contends that the discussions held within the executive branch and the extensive vetting of evidence constitute a form of due process. Meanwhile, as the legal scholar Benjamin Wittes has pointed out, both Congress and the federal courts have repeatedly reaffirmed the validity of the AUMF since 2001. The U.S. government argues that given how secretly terrorists operate, it is not always possible to use other means to stop an individual overseas from planning attacks on U.S. forces or allies. As a result, the imminence of a threat should be assessed based on the individual\u2019s propensity for violence and the likelihood of being able to stop him in the future. Wittes compares the decision-making process to that used in hostage situations, when police are not required to ask a judge for authority to kill a hostage taker or refrain from taking a clear shot if they have one. Perhaps most important, the White House has claimed only a very limited right to conduct drone strikes against U.S. citizens. The administration has asserted the authority to kill only senior al Qaeda leaders who cannot be captured, not any American member of al Qaeda. Indeed, it appears that Awlaki is the only U.S. citizen who has been deliberately killed by a drone.?FOLLOW THE LEADERThe fact remains that by using drones so much, Washington risks setting a troublesome precedent with regard to extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings. Zeke Johnson of Amnesty International contends that \u201cwhen the U.S. government violates international law, that sets a precedent and provides an excuse for the rest of the world to do the same.\u201d And it is alarming to think what leaders such as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has used deadly force against peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators he has deemed terrorists, would do with drones of their own. Similarly, Iran could mockingly cite the U.S. precedent to justify sending drones after rebels in Syria. Even Brennan has conceded that the administration is \u201cestablishing precedents that other nations may follow.\u201dControlling the spread of drone technology will prove impossible; that horse left the barn years ago. Drones are highly capable weapons that are easy to produce, and so there is no chance that Washington can stop other militaries from acquiring and using them. Nearly 90 other countries already have surveillance drones in their arsenals, and China is producing several inexpensive models for export. Armed drones are more difficult to produce and deploy, but they, too, will likely spread rapidly. Beijing even recently announced (although later denied) that it had considered sending a drone to Myanmar (also called Burma) to kill a wanted drug trafficker hiding there.The spread of drones cannot be stopped, but the United States can still influence how they are used. The coming proliferation means that Washington needs to set forth a clear policy now on extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings of terrorists\u2014and stick to it. Fortunately, Obama has begun to discuss what constitutes a legitimate drone strike. But the definition remains murky, and this murkiness will undermine the president\u2019s ability to denounce other countries\u2019 behavior should they start using drones or other means to hunt down enemies. By keeping its policy secret, Washington also makes it easier for critics to claim that the United States is wantonly slaughtering innocents. More transparency would make it harder for countries such as Pakistan to make outlandish claims about what the United States is doing. Drones actually protect many Pakistanis, and Washington should emphasize this fact. By being more open, the administration could also show that it carefully considers the law and the risks to civilians before ordering a strike.Washington needs to be especially open about its use of signature strikes. According to the Obama administration, signature strikes have eliminated not only low-level al Qaeda and Taliban figures but also a surprising number of higher-level officials whose presence at the scenes of the strikes was unexpected. Signature strikes are in keeping with traditional military practice; for the most part, U.S. soldiers have been trained to strike enemies at large, such as German soldiers or Vietcong guerrillas, and not specific individuals. The rise of unconventional warfare, however, has made this usual strategy more difficult because the battlefield is no longer clearly defined and enemies no longer wear identifiable uniforms, making combatants harder to distinguish from civilians. In the case of drones, where there is little on-the-ground knowledge of who is who, signature strikes raise legitimate concerns, especially because the Obama administration has not made clear what its rules and procedures for such strikes are.Washington should exercise particular care with regard to signature strikes because mistakes risk tarnishing the entire drone program. In the absence of other information, the argument that drones are wantonly killing innocents is gaining traction in the United States and abroad. More transparency could help calm these fears that Washington is acting recklessly.The U.S. government also needs to guard against another kind of danger: that the relative ease of using drones will make U.S. intervention abroad too common. The scholars Daniel Brunstetter and Megan Braun have argued that drones provide \u201ca way to avoid deploying troops or conducting an intensive bombing campaign\u201d and that this \u201cmay encourage countries to act on just cause with an ease that is potentially worrisome.\u201d Although al Qaeda remains a threat, it has been substantially defanged since 9/11, thanks to the destruction of its haven in Afghanistan and effective global police, intelligence, and drone campaigns against its cells. In addition, the U.S. government needs to remember that many of the world\u2019s jihadist organizations are focused first and foremost on local regimes and that although the United States has an interest in helping its allies fight extremists, Washington cannot and should not directly involve itself in every fight. The Obama administration should spell out those cases in which the AUMF does not apply and recognize the risks of carrying out so-called goodwill kills on behalf of foreign governments. Helping French and Malian forces defeat jihadists in Mali by providing logistical support, for example, is smart policy, but sending U.S. drones there is not.In places where terrorists are actively plotting against the United States, however, drones give Washington the ability to limit its military commitments abroad while keeping Americans safe. Afghanistan, for example, could again become a Taliban-run haven for terrorists after U.S. forces depart next year. Drones can greatly reduce the risk of this happening. Hovering in the skies above, they can keep Taliban leaders on the run and hinder al Qaeda\u2019s ability to plot another 9/11.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim operatives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer U.S <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Yemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Place Pakistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim Atiyah Abd al-Rahman <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim innocents <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim children <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strikes <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim civilians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Killer United States <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim doctor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Victim Baitullah Mehsud <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Yemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack fired <extra_id_0> Instrument Tomahawks <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker United States <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Killer officer <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Texas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Place Yemen <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Victim Anwar al-Awlaki <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TeachingTrainingLearning train <extra_id_0> Learner recruits <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Two drones packed with explosives reportedly flew toward Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Saturday night in what the government has described as a failed assassination attempt.Here's a look at the details:What happened?Assailants launched two drones filled with a total of more than 4 pounds of plastic explosives toward Maduro, his wife and other top Venezuelan leaders, according to the Associated Press.The attack occurred while Maduro was making a speech at a huge outdoor event in Caracas to celebrate the 81st anniversary of the country's national guard. One of the drones was set to explode above the president while the second was set to detonate in front of him, according to Interior Minister Nestor Reverol.The Venezuelan military knocked one of the drones off-course electronically. The second drone crashed into an apartment building about two blocks from where Maduro was speaking to hundreds of troops, Reverol said.Photos taken at the event showed security officers surrounding Maduro with some sort of large black shields as they escorted him away.\"That drone came after me,\" Maduro said. \"But there was a shield of love that always protects us. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll live for many more years.\"Who launched the drone attack?The Venezuelan government alleges that Maduro's political opponents conspired with individuals in Miami and Bogota, Colombia, to try to kill Maduro. They have so far offered no real proof to support this claim, and opposition leaders charge that Maduro is using the attack as an excuse to crack down on his critics.Government authorities said Sunday that they have detained six people \u2013 whom they described as \"terrorists and assassins\" \u2013 in connection with the attack. Among those detained: a man who took part in 2014 protests against the government and a man who had a warrant out for his arrest for attacking a military barracks.Maduro accused the \u201cfar right,\u201d working with conspirators in Miami and Bogota \u2013including Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos \u2013 of launching the attack. Colombia\u2019s government has denied any role in the violence.Maduro, who accuses the U.S. of supporting his opponents, called on President Donald Trump to hold the \"terrorist group\" accountable.John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, said Sunday he would like to see solid evidence to support Maduro's claims.\"If the government of Venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of U.S. criminal law, we\u2019ll take a serious look at it,\" Bolton said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"What is the political and economic situation in Venezuela?Venezuela is in the midst of an economic crisis that has been described as worse than the Great Depression that devastated the United States and much of the rest of the world in the 1930s.The inflation rate is set to hit a stunning 13,000 percent this year. There are shortages of food and medicine and a soaring crime rate, spurring refugees to flee into neighboring countries. More than 600,000 Venezuelans have crossed into Colombia, and Brazil has declared a state of emergency because of all the Venezuelans sweeping into that nation.Maduro is viewed by the United States and other democratic countries as a corrupt, left-wing dictator who imposes strict controls on his people and on the press. He won re-election to a six-year term in May, but the process was widely viewed as a rigged farce.The Trump administration imposed new economic sanctions on Venezuela immediately after the election in an effort to stop Maduro from selling off government debt to enrich himself.What could happen next?Reverol said there could be more arrests. Critics fear an even greater government crackdown on Maduro's political opponents.\"The investigation will get to the bottom of this,\" Maduro said. \"No matter who falls.\"More:Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says drone attack was 'attempt to kill me'More:Venezuelan opposition leaders taken from their homes by state security agents", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Crash crashed <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> CrashObject building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flew <extra_id_0> Vehicle drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation launched <extra_id_0> Transporter Assailants <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact speech <extra_id_0> Communicator Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation escorted <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transporter they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack kill <extra_id_0> Target Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain detained <extra_id_0> Jailer authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee whom <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protests <extra_id_0> Topic the government <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrator who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacking <extra_id_0> Attacker who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target barracks <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassination  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand called <extra_id_0> Recipient Donald Trump <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Communicator Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flee <extra_id_0> Destination countries <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact refugees <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation crossed <extra_id_0> Destination Colombia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack kill <extra_id_0> Target me <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain taken <extra_id_0> Detainee opposition leaders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer state <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

Pine View High School in March 2018, St.George, Utah, April 24, 2019 | Photo by court pool, St.George NewsST.GEORGE \u2014 A judge sentenced a Hurricane teen who brought a homemade bomb to his high school last year to serve four years of \"intensely supervised\" probation Wednesday.Martin Farnsworth appears in 5th District Court via video conference for his initial appearance, St.George, Utah, July 31, 2018 | File photo via court pool, St.George NewsMartin Farnsworth, 17, appeared in 5thDistrict Court Wednesday afternoon where Judge Michael Westfall sentenced him to serve 48 months of supervised probation and 250 hours of community service, along with additional restrictions.Farnsworth had been facing a potential five years-to-life prison term that came with the first-degree felony charge of attempting to injure others with an incendiary device that he pleaded guilty to last month as a part of a plea deal.Prior to taking the plea, Farnsworth faced felony charges for attempted murder and possession of a weapon of mass destruction.The case was originally set in juvenile court last year but was moved to 5th District Court where he was tried as an adult due to the severity of the incident involved.Read more: Judge: 16-year-old who brought bomb to Pine View High School will be tried as adultThe charges stem from a March 5, 2018 incident in which Farnsworth took a homemade explosive to Pine View High School.He placed the would-be incendiary device in a backpack in the cafeteria area during lunch and left after lighting a fuse.At the time, the cafeteria contained between 75-150 students.Pine View High School students are evacuated to the football field as police investigate a bomb scare inside the school and swept the parking lot as a precaution, St.George, Utah, March 5, 2018 | File photo by Mori Kessler, St.George NewsStudents noticed smoke coming from the backpack that contained the device and reported it to school faculty and the school\u2019s resource officer, triggering an evacuation of the school and a multi-agency response from law enforcement.While the incendiary device\u2019s fuse fizzled out and failed to ignite, investigators determined that if it had gone off, it would have caused damage to the immediate area and injured those near it.The device was constructed out of a \"metal soup can filled with metal BB shots removed from shot gun shells,\" according to court documents.It also included \"three canning lids with masking tape, BBs, an improvised fuse, black gun powder, white plastic cup, empty box of box-strike matches, three 16.9 oz.water bottles of gasoline\" and other items.Investigators found that Farnsworth learned to make an incendiary device via online instructions believed to be connected to the Islamic State terror group, according to court records and testimony.Public defender Edward Flint said he was pleased with the sentence in the Martin Farnsworth case, as getting his client released from further incarceration and placed on probation was a primary goal, St.George, Utah, April 24, 2019 | Photo by court pool, St.George NewsEdward Flint, Farnsworth\u2019s attorney, said that building the incendiary device and attempting to use it were a response to bullying his client had received at school and he finally snapped.The result was a criminal act, he added.\"The way life is going, it\u2019s not going well,\" Farnsworth said in a recording of a police interview after he was taken into custody.\"There\u2019s a bunch of bad people.I don\u2019t like the way the world is going.I just wanted to do something to make it different.\"Read more: \u2018If someone got hurt, I probably wouldn\u2019t care\u2019; Teen charged with attempted murder in Pine View High bomb scare\"He feels guilt and remorse, yes, but differently,\" Flint said, referring to Farnsworth being diagnosed with a mild, yet high-functioning form of autism and severe depression.The diagnosis was made by a mental health expert as a part of an evaluation connected to the pre-sentencing report.Read more: Defense in Pine View bombing case says Washington County School District failed teenFlint said the severe depression was a result of the bullying.The perceived lack of empathy on Farnsworth\u2019s part over what he\u2019d done was also a sign of autism spectrum disorder, and not necessary a sign the teen didn\u2019t regret was he had done.\"He\u2019s a model citizen and a good person all around \u2013 but he snapped,\" Flint said.Deputy Washington County Attorney Angela Adams addresses the court in regard to the sentencing of Martin Farnsworth, St.George, Utah, April 24, 2019 | Photo by Court Pool, St.George NewsWestfall did not agree with Flint\u2019s assessment.Being bullied to the point where you hit the bully is snapping, he said.In contrast, Farnsworth\u2019s action were planned out.\"This took some planning.This took some thought, and that\u2019s troubling to me, because you didn\u2019t just \u2018snap.\u2019\"Westfall also addressed Farnsworth prior to sentencing, mentioning that one of the teen\u2019s siblings had written a letter to the court saying the event didn\u2019t define who their brother was.\"Unfortunately, there are things we do that define us,\" Westfall said.\"Had this incendiary device gone off and someone had been hurt, not only would you be defined by this behavior, but so would your family.\"In addition to the 48 months of probation and 250 hours community service, Westfall ordered Farnsworth to wear an ankle monitor for 90 days, have no access to bomb-making materials, seek a psychiatric evaluation for the purpose of getting needed medications, have no internet access for six months, observe a curfew and write an apology letter to Pine View High and its students.Following the sentencing, Deputy Washington County Attorney Angela Adams, who prosecuted the case, said the state was satisfied with the outcome.5th District Judge Michael

getting 48 months of intensely supervised probation,\" Adams said, adding that if Farnsworth does something to put his probation in jeopardy, he could still end up facing the five years-to-life sentence suspended by the judge.\"Of course, we hope he will be successful on probation,\" she said.Adams also said she believes justice was served to the extent that the community is being protected and all involved are doing what they can to minimize the possibility of this incident repeating itself.\"The state is satisfied that the safeguards put into place will protect the community.\"The defense was also pleased with the results of the sentencing.\"What we were hoping for was (Farnsworth) being released from custody into probation without any further juvenile or adult incarceration and that\u2019s what we got,\" Flint said.Farnsworth served 415 days in juvenile detention prior to being released Wednesday.As for the additional restrictions, Flint said they were to be expected and not out of the ordinary for a case involving a first-degree felony.When asked about his client\u2019s reaction, Flint said he didn\u2019t have much of one.\"Martin doesn\u2019t react much,\" he said.\"That\u2019s the nature of autism spectrum disorder.He\u2019s very quiet and introverted.\"Farnsworth\u2019s autism was an angle largely ignored by the state, Flint said, which led to him being treated as a common criminal rather than as someone who needed additional consideration.\"Individuals with autism have a difficult time understanding how other people feel, and have a difficult time processing their own feelings when they are bullied or made fun of or even when they interact normally with other people, they\u2019re going to react differently, and it\u2019s like none of that mattered,\" he said.\"He committed a crime, no doubt about that, but it seems like nobody\u2019s noticing that he\u2019s autistic and he needs help.\"Copyright St.George News, SaintGeorgeUtah.com LLC,

{"text": "Had his homemade bomb gone off\u2014one he had diabolically constructed using shrapnel coated with a substance meant to keep blood from clotting in wounds\u2014Kevin Harpham would have undoubtedly caused the death and injury of many people at last year\u2019s Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Unity March in Spokane, Washington.Instead, Harpham was eventually caught and recently sentenced to 32 years in prison for a hate crime and other offenses related to the attempted bombing. The case illustrates how a quick response by citizens and local law enforcement averted a tragedy and how teamwork and time-tested investigative techniques led to the apprehension of an individual who has shown no remorse for his actions.\u201cClearly he intended to detonate the device, cause mass carnage, and then survey the devastation,\u201d said Special Agent Frank Harrill, who supervised the investigation. \u201cHarpham was acting out against what he termed multiculturalism, but his hatred was firmly rooted in violent white supremacy. This was a prototypical hate crime.\u201dOn January 17, 2011, as hundreds of people gathered in downtown Spokane to participate in the march, Harpham placed his backpack bomb along the parade route at Washington Street and Main Avenue. Alert city workers discovered the suspicious backpack before the march started, and Spokane Police Department officials changed the route as a precaution. The Spokane Police and Sheriff\u2019s Office bomb squad was called in, and their precision in disarming the device enabled evidence to be preserved that would help lead FBI agents to Harpham.The FBI\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) in Spokane immediately began an investigation, and JTTF members canvassed the region for batteries and other components similar to those used in the bomb. Within a month, in a small town about 60 miles north of Spokane, they discovered that a local outlet of a large retail chain was selling the same kind of fishing weights Harpham had used as shrapnel.Store records showed there had been three large purchases of the weights in recent months\u2014two were paid for in cash, but a debit card was used in one transaction, and it belonged to Harpham. At the same time, the FBI Laboratory had been working to extract a DNA sample from the backpack that was later matched to Harpham through his military records.Investigators also learned of Harpham\u2019s white supremacy postings on the Internet and his affiliation with a neo-Nazi group called the National Alliance.Because he lived in a remote, relatively inaccessible area and was likely heavily armed, our Hostage Rescue Team devised a ruse to lure Harpham out of his house. He was arrested March 9, 2011 without incident\u2014but as agents suspected, he was armed when taken into custody.\u201cKevin Harpham was the lone wolf that all of us in law enforcement dread,\u201d Harrill said. \u201cHe lived alone, he worked alone, and he didn\u2019t foreshadow the bombing plot in any meaningful way. He targeted those who were attempting to celebrate an event meant to unite society,\u201d Harrill added, \u201cand he was prepared to indiscriminately kill men, women, and children.\u201dHarrill credited teamwork and strong partnerships for stopping Harpham and bringing him to justice. \u201cFrom the workers who noticed the device to the police response, the JTTF investigation, the expertise of the FBI Laboratory, and the prosecuting skill of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office\u2014everything worked just as it should have.\u201dResources:- Washington Man Sentenced to 32 Years (12/20/2011)- Attempted Bomber Pleads Guilty (09/07/2011)- Attempted Bomber Arrested (03/09/2011)", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentenced <extra_id_0> Defendant Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime offenses  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain caught <extra_id_0> Detainee Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain Arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Bomber <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence Sentenced <extra_id_0> Defendant Man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle disarming <extra_id_0> Artifact device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Disabler squad <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Harrill <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Kevin Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonate <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice device <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Participant Frank Harrill <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator who <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator Joint Terrorism Task Force <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die kill <extra_id_0> Victim children <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact added <extra_id_0> Participant Harrill <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ImpedeInterfereWith stopping  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Convict Pleads Guilty <extra_id_0> Defendant Bomber <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack gone off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice his homemade bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble constructed <extra_id_0> Artifact one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components substance <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die death <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injury <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime crime  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate march <extra_id_0> Demonstrator people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell purchases <extra_id_0> PaymentBarter debit card <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact postings <extra_id_0> Participant Harpham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic white supremacy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection discovered <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity backpack <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Observer workers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate march  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels.The police academy car bombing \u201cwas a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [Cuba acting] to avoid justice being done\u201d, Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima.Colombians, including Duque, planned to join in a march on Sunday to protest against the car bombing, the worst such attack in the country in 16 years.Last rebel groupIn November, Colombia asked Cuba to capture ELN rebel commander Nicolas Rodriguez and provide information about the presence of other commanders in the Cuban territory.The government in Bogota also asked Havana to act on an Interpol Red Notice against Rodriguez. The Cuban government did not respond publicly to that request or made a statement about the issue.Colombia has experienced several years of relative calm since the 2016 peace accord signed by then-President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) fighters.190118182118648With the landmark agreement turning the former rebels into a political party, the smaller ELN is considered the last active rebel group in the country.True to his election promises, Duque has taken a hard line against the ELN.Peace talks with the ELN began in February 2017 under Santos, but Duque has put them on hold until the rebels free all their hostages and stop attacks on military and civilian targets.The group is believed to be currently holding 17 hostages, some of them for several years.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand request <extra_id_0> Communicator Colombia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Cuba <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ImpedeInterfereWith sidesteps <extra_id_0> Impeder Cuba <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Bogota <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker National Liberation Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand urged <extra_id_0> Communicator Ivan Duque <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Cuba <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim attacker <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer ELN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker ELN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target academy <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Bogota <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> RequestCommand asked <extra_id_0> Communicator Colombia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Cuba <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain capture <extra_id_0> Detainee Nicolas Rodriguez <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protest <extra_id_0> Demonstrator Colombians <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was attending a ceremony to celebrate the 81st anniversary of the National Guard in Caracas on August 4, 2018.Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro survived an alleged assassination attempt via drone on Saturday when a flying device carrying explosives detonated during a speech he was delivering in Caracas.Maduro, an unpopular leader who has presided over one of the worst economic collapses in Latin America in recent history, blamed the \"far right,\" including Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, for the attack.Here\u2019s what happened: On Saturday evening, Maduro was addressing the crowd at a military parade celebrating the 81st anniversary of the National Guard when a flying device approached and exploded, according to Venezuelan officials.Footage of the event, which was broadcast on live television, shows Maduro look up mid-speech, while his wife Cilia Flores, who is standing behind him, flinches.For a few seconds, no one appears to react, as they seem to be processing what\u2019s happened.\"Seconds later, there was a second explosion,\" Maduro said in a national address recounting the incident.Then the crowd disperses and people flee.Some images on Twitter capture the chaos and aftermath.Quisieron poner a prueba lealtades-de la Fuerza Armada y del pueblo sobre todo- y ya ven que somos infranqueables a la hora de defender nuestro proceso revolucionario y a nuestro l\u00edder @NicolasMaduro El fascismo No pasar\u00e1.pic.twitter.com/Nsa0fY4fOc\u2014 freddy \u00f1a\u00f1ez (@luchaalmada) August 5, 2018Seven members of the National Guard were harmed in the attack, Information Minister Jorge Rodr\u00edguez said at a press conference after the incident.He added that Maduro was unharmed and in a \"perfect state of health.\"\"This was an attempt to kill me,\" Maduro later said in a retelling of what happened.\"Today they attempted to assassinate me.\"Firefighters at the scene disputed that account, however, telling the Associated Press that a gas tank had exploded nearby.Maduro, 55, said he believed the attempted attack was part of a right-wing plot against him that was working with opponents in Bogot\u00e1 and Miami, including Santos, the outgoing Colombian president.He provided no evidence to back up his accusations.The Colombian government called Maduro\u2019s charges \"absurd.\"Other countries expressed support for Maduro after the attack, including Turkey, Syria, Nicaragua, and Russia.Bolivian President Evo Morales in a series of tweets expressed solidarity with Maduro and described the attempt as a \"crime against humanity.\"A little-known group called Soldiers in T-Shirts claimed responsibility for the act, saying they planned to fly two drones at the president but the devices were shot down.The AP couldn\u2019t verify the claims, and the group didn\u2019t respond to a message from the outlet when it reached out for comment.National Security Adviser John Bolton said in an appearance onFox News Sundaythat the United States had \"no involvement\" in the incident.\"If the government of Venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of US criminal law, we\u2019ll take a serious look at it, but in the meantime I think what we really should focus on is the corruption and oppression in the Maduro regime in Venezuela,\" he said.The political situation in Venezuela is badMaduro, a former bus driver who took over as president after former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez died in 2013, has overseen a catastrophic economic collapse in Venezuela.The socialist economy, once thriving, has spiraled since global oil prices dropped in 2014.Venezuelans suffer from widespread food and medicine shortages, and the majority of the country is living in poverty.Seventy-five percent of the country\u2019s population lost an average of 19 pounds of bodyweight between 2015 and 2016, and the International Monetary Fund expects inflation in Venezuela to reach 13,000 percent in 2018.Thousands of Venezuelans are fleeing the country.Yet Maduro remains in power.He won reelection in May due to a largely rigged election.He banned two of the most popular opposition leaders, Leopoldo Lopez and Henrique Capriles, from running against him, and implied that any Venezuelans who didn\u2019t vote for him could lose government food subsidies.His election is likely to worsen the economic crisis in Venezuela: Instead of electing a reformer who might enact the measures necessary to pull the country out of the state it\u2019s in right now, such as addressing its currency exchange policy and diversifying the economy away from oil dependence, the country now has Maduro for another six years.And he remains defiant \u2014 in the face of opposition, or alleged assassination attempts.Update: Story updated with comments from John Bolton.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument drone

{"text": "Analysis backs claim drones were used to attack Venezuela\u2019s presidentAnalysis of open source information carried out by the investigative website Bellingcat suggests drones that had been repurposed as flying bombs were indeed used in an attack on the president of Venezuela this weekend.The Venezuelan government claimed three days ago that an attempt had been made to assassinate President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro using two drones loaded with explosives.The president had been giving a speech which was being broadcast live on television when the incident occurred.Initial video from a state-owned television network showed the reaction of Maduro, those around him and a parade of soldiers at the event to what appeared to be two blasts somewhere off camera.But the footage did not include shots of any drones or explosions.AP also reported that firefighters at scene had shed doubt on the drone attack claim \u2014 suggesting there had instead been a gas explosion in a nearby flat.Since then more footage has emerged, including videos purporting to show a drone exploding and a drone tumbling alongside a building.Bellingcat has carried out an analysis of publicly available information related to the attack, including syncing timings of the state broadcast of Maduro\u2019s speech, and using frame-by-frame analysis combined with photos and satellite imagery of Caracas to try to pinpoint locations of additional footage that has emerged to determine whether the drone attack claim stands up.The Venezuelan government has claimed the drones used were DJI Matrice 600s, each carrying approximately 1kg of C4 plastic explosive and, when detonated, capable of causing damage at a radius of around 50 meters.DJI Matrice 600 drones are a commercial model, normally used for industrial work \u2014 with a U.S. price tag of around $5,000 apiece, suggesting the attack could have cost little over $10k to carry out \u2014 with 1kg of plastic explosive available commercially (for demolition purposes) at a cost of around $30.Bellingcat says its analysis supports the government\u2019s claim that the drone model used was a DJI Matrice 600, noting that the drones involved in the event each had six rotors.It also points to a photo of drone wreckage which appears to show the distinctive silver rotor tip of the model, although it also notes the drones appear to have had their legs removed.Venezuela\u2019s interior minister, Nestor Reverol, also claimed the government thwarted the attack using \"special techniques and [radio] signal inhibitors\", which \"disoriented\" the drone that detonated closest to the presidential stand \u2014 a capability Bellingcat notes the Venezuelan security services are reported to have.The second drone was said by Reverol to have \"lost control\" and crashed into a nearby building.Bellingcat says it is possible to geolocate the video of the falling drone to the same location as the fire in the apartment that firefighters had claimed was caused by a gas canister explosion.It adds that images taken of this location during the fire show a hole in the wall of the apartment in the vicinity of where the drone would have crashed.\"It is a very likely possibility that the downed drone subsequently detonated, creating the hole in the wall of this apartment, igniting a fire, and causing the sound of the second explosion which can be heard in Video 2 [of the state TV broadcast of Maduro\u2019s speech],\" it further suggests.Here\u2019s its conclusion:From the open sources of information available, it appears that an attack took place using two DBIEDs while Maduro was giving a speech.Both the drones appear visually similar to DJI Matrice 600s, with at least one displaying features that are consistent with this model.These drones appear to have been loaded with explosive and flown towards the parade.The first drone detonated somewhere above or near the parade, the most likely cause of the casualties announced by the Venezuelan government and pictured on social media.The second drone crashed and exploded approximately 14 seconds later and 400 meters away from the stage, and is the most likely cause of the fire which the Venezuelan firefighters described.It also considers the claim of attribution by a group on social media, calling itself \"Soldados de Franelas\" (aka \u2018T-Shirt Soldiers\u2019 \u2014 a reference to a technique used by protestors wrapping a t-shirt around their head to cover their face and protect their identity), suggesting it\u2019s not clear from the group\u2019s Twitter messages that they are \"unequivocally claiming responsibility for the event\", owing to use of passive language, and to a claim that the drones were shot down by government snipers \u2014 which it says \"does not appear to be supported by the open source information available\".", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Instrument drones

{"text": "Third London Attacker Named as British PM Faces Mounting CriticismLONDON \u2014\u00a0British Prime Minister Theresa May is being forced to defend her past record as the country\u2019s interior minister, and the political architect of Britain\u2019s counter-terror system, as more details emerge of the three attackers and what security agencies knew about them before their van-and-knife rampage Saturday in the heart of London.Ahead of Thursday's vote in a snap post-Brexit parliamentary election, which May called with the expectation of securing a landslide victory, the terror attack is undermining the air of dogged competence May carefully crafted as the country's home secretary, a post she held for six years and relinquished on becoming prime minister last year.Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May speaks outside 10 Downing Street after an attack on London Bridge and Borough Market left 7 people dead and dozens injured in London, June 4, 2017.Foreign Minister Boris Johnson conceded Tuesday that there were questions to answer about how the three militants slipped through the intelligence net. He was speaking as police named the third attacker as 22-year-old Italian-Moroccan Youssef Zaghba, who was on an Italian watchlist and suspected of being a foreign fighter.Born in Fez, Morocco, in 1995 to an Italian mother and a Moroccan father, Zaghba was stopped by Italian police at the Bologna airport on March 15 of last year after arousing suspicions he was going to join the Islamic State terror group to fight in Syria.Italian officials say he had a one-way ticket to Istanbul and was carrying just a small backpack. His cell phone, which was seized, contained jihadist content, including pictures and videos, and he was placed on a watchlist as a suspected foreign fighter. Italian officials say they shared intelligence on him with both the British and Moroccan security agencies.Lived in BritainThe last few years Zaghba lived in Britain, where he worked on and off at a restaurant and a hotel near Regents Park, traveling back and forth to visit his mother, who lives in Bologna.The naming of the third Islamic militant came after it emerged earlier Tuesday that the ringleader of Saturday\u2019s attack, 27-year-old British-Pakistani Khuram Shazad Butt worked for a man accused of helping to train the Islamic extremists responsible for the July 7, 2005 underground train bombings in London, Britain\u2019s first Islamist suicide attack. Fifty-two people were killed across Britain\u2019s capital in the coordinated strike and more than 700 others were injured.This is undated three photo combo handout photo issued by the Metropolitan Police on Tuesday June 6, 2017 of Khuram Shazad Butt, left, Rachid Redouane, centre and Youssef Zaghba who have been named as the suspects in Saturday's attack at London Bridge.Counterterror analysts say they are surprised that Butt remained a \"low priority\" for the security services despite his close connections to Sajeel Shahid, a 41-year-old who ran an all-Muslin gym in east London and was named in a New York court case as having helped to set up weapons training in Pakistan for the July 7 suicide bombers.\u201cIt was a blunder to have downgraded the terror threat in Britain so quickly after the Manchester bombing,\u201d said Olivier Guitta, managing director at GlobalStrat, a security and geopolitical risk firm. He says with election campaigning under way coinciding with Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, the chances of attacks were always high.Guitta, who has advised government in the past on counterterrorism, said, \u201cNo one should be surprised by the terrorism wave and which is linked to a policy of laissez-faire policy toward extremists.\u201dThe main charge leveled against May by Labour politicians and the leaders of the country\u2019s smaller parties is the large cuts she introduced on funding for Britain\u2019s police. Those cuts resulted in police personnel being drawn down from 2010 to 2016 by more than 20,000 officers.Uncertain election impactOn Monday, the opposition parties received support for their criticism from an unlikely quarter. Conservative insider Steve Hilton, the policy guru of former Prime Minister David Cameron, demanded May resign over what he termed \u201csecurity failures,\u201d which he said led to Saturday\u2019s attack and the bombing of a concert last month in Manchester.He said May should be \u201cresigning, not seeking re-election.\u201dPollsters are wary of predicting how the terrorist attacks \u2014 three in the past 10 weeks \u2014 will impact the voting on Thursday, but Labour leaders say they have renewed hope at the very least of reducing the ruling Conservative\u2019s majority as they seek to recast their campaign message in the final hours before voting as \u201cinvestment versus cuts.\u201dOn Sunday, May promised to review Britain's counterterrorism strategy, holding out the prospect of enhanced powers for the security services and longer prison sentences for extremists. May said she wants to take a tougher line with internet providers and social media businesses that allow extremist material on their sites.She warned there has been \u201cfar too much tolerance of extremism\u201d in Britain and promised to step up the fight against Islamist terrorism after the London Bridge attack, saying \u201cenough is enough.\u201dVideo sizewidthxheightpixelsBritain PM May: 'Enough is Enough'Share this video0:00:30\u25b60:00:00/0:00:30\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 1.5MB360p | 1.8MB480p | 10.5MBBritish counterterror chiefs say that while Butt was investigated in 2015, he was deemed a low risk. According to Assistant Police Commissioner Mark Rowley, he had seen \u201cnothing to show that a poor decision has been made\u201d in 2015 and that police had no evidence Butt was planning anything.Police, however, confirm they received several warnings from neighbors and associates about Butt.British police and MI5 set up in 2013 an early warning system, known as Project Danube, to help them spot when low-priority suspects might be re-engaging in violent extremism. That program appears to have failed, say critics, as it did not help them identify Khalid Masood, the militant responsible for the Westminster Bridge attack in March that killed five people. Nor did it alert them to the Manchester Arena bomber, British-Libyan Salman Abedi.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack rampage <extra_id_0> Instrument knife <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> EndPosition relinquished <extra_id_0> Employee she <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PlaceOfEmployment home <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> StartPosition becoming <extra_id_0> Employee she <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target Borough Market <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die dead <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim dozens <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TeachingTrainingLearning train <extra_id_0> Learner extremists <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombings <extra_id_0> Place London <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target train <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim others <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack strike  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target London Bridge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TeachingTrainingLearning training  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Manchester <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Place Manchester <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target London Bridge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigated <extra_id_0> Defendant Butt <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target Westminster Bridge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Khalid Masood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "DIY Drone Instructable: How To Deliver a PayloadOverviewThese instructions guide you to build a DIY payload delivery drone system that can be mounted on your drone/quadcopter and used to deliver a package to any address.The smart, low-cost delivery solution uses GPS to find its destination and then employs an ultrasonic sensor to measure the ground clearance.Depending on your drone capabilities, this payload system can lift up to 2kg freight.A servo motor is used to release the payload at the desired location.This guide also provides a solution to the sensor integration problem.You can integrate GPS, servo, and ultrasonic sensors without any serial interference.DIY payload delivery drone systemComponentsBreadboardArduino Mega/UnoServo motor SG90Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04GPS module NEO-6M-001Connecting wiresA bottle capGlue/TapeHair pinBreadboardArduino Mega/UnoServo motor SG90Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04GPS module NEO-6M-001connecting wiresbottle caphair pinStep 1: Connecting the Ultrasonic SensorTake the breadboard and affix the Arduino to its one side, as shown in the picture.Now, take the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and attach it to the lower side of the breadboard.Make the connections as shown in Figure 1.Connect the pins as follows:Vcc (Ultrasonic) -> 5V (Arduino)GND (Ultrasonic) -> GND (Arduino)Trig pin (Ultrasonic) -> pin 8 (Arduino)Echo pin (Ultrasonic) -> pin 9 (Arduino)Run the following code to check if the ultrasonic sensor is functional.The Serial Monitor will show the following output:Step 2: Connecting the GPS ModuleTake the NEO-6M GPS module and insert its pins into the breadboard.Make connections as shown in Figure 2.Don\u2019t forget to download TinyGPS++ library if missing.Connect the pins as follows:Vcc (GPS module) -> 3.3V (Arduino)2GND (GPS module) -> GND (Arduino)RX pin (GPS module) -> pin 1 (Arduino)TX pin (GPS module) -> pin 0 (Arduino)Figure 2Run the following code and check if the GPS sensor is functional.DON\u2019T FORGET to remove the TX pin of GPS module from pin 0 of Arduino; otherwise, your code won\u2019t upload.Once the code is uploaded, first open Serial Monitor; then, connect the TX pin of GPS to pin 0 to view the current location of drone, time, and date.The Serial Monitor will show output:Step 3: Connecting the Bottle CapNow, take a bottle cap to prepare the payload-releasing mechanism.The mechanism itself is simple.You hook the payload on the hairpin inside the bottle cap, and when the servo moves it pulls off the hairpin from the bottle cap, resulting the payload to drop.Make holes on both sides of the cap.Attach the cap on the lower side of the breadboard, as shown in the pictures.Step 4: Connecting the ServoFirst, take a hair pin and connect it to the limb of the servo using a staple, as shown in the picture.Take the servo and attach it under the breadboard such that the hair pin passes through both the holes of the bottle cap.Connect the Servo with Arduino in the following way, as shown in Figure 3.PWM Pin (Servo) -> Pin 14 (Arduino)Vcc Pin (Servo) -> 5V (Arduino)GND Pin (Servo) -> GND (Arduino)Figure 3It will look like this when you attach the whole system to your drone.Run the following code to check if the servo is functional.Step 5: Putting it All TogetherMake sure you make all the connections as shown in Figure 4.You\u2019ll integrate the sensors without using SoftwareSerial library.Employing hardware serial ports of your Arduino will minimize serial interference between libraries; hence, eliminating the servo vibration.Figure 4Open the Arduino window and paste the following code.In the code, set the desired GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude) where you need to drop off the basket.Once the desired location is added, click Upload.Again, don\u2019t forget to remove the TX pin of GPS from pin 0 before uploading the code.Upload the code on your Arduino and click the Serial Monitor icon in the top right corner.You\u2019ll see the current GPS coordinates of your drone.Let your drone fly to the desired location.When your drone reaches the desired address, bring it closer to the ground.The ultrasonic sensor will calculate the ground clearance.When it\u2019s about 15 cm, the servo releases the payload.The serial monitor prompts you when the package is delivered, and records the time as well.After dropping the payload, fly your drone back to its initial point.Precaution DO NOT put more than 2 kg load in the basket otherwise it will damage the assembly.Also be sure to check the spec of your drone so you will know how much weight that drone can handle.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Transportation Deliver <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Payload <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation deliver <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact package <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transporter your <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone/quadcopter <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination address <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation fly <extra_id_0> Transporter your <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination desired location <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation fly <extra_id_0> Transporter your <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination initial point <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble mounted <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler you <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components DIY payload delivery drone system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact drone/quadcopter <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble build <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler you <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact DIY payload delivery drone system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection measure <extra_id_0> Instrument ultrasonic sensor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle release <extra_id_0> Components payload <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument servo motor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place desired location <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble integrate <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler You <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components servo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact ultrasonic sensors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble affix <extra_id_0> Components Arduino <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact breadboard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble attach <extra_id_0> Components HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact breadboard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Connecting <extra_id_0> Components GPS Module <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble insert <extra_id_0> Components pins <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact breadboard <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Connecting <extra_id_0> Components Bottle Cap <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Connecting <extra_id_0> Components Servo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Connect <extra_id_0> Components Servo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact Arduino <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection calculate <extra_id_0> Instrument ultrasonic sensor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation reaches <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination desired address, <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection find <extra_id_0> Instrument GPS <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble attach <extra_id_0> Components whole system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle remove <extra_id_0> Components GPS module <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble connect <extra_id_0> Components GPS <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble Attach <extra_id_0> Components cap <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble integrate <extra_id_0> Components sensors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle releases <extra_id_0> Components payload <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact servo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

Thirty-year-old Ricardo Campos was killed in a separate incident in Sucre.Few details were provided on the deaths.Leaders with the opposition Democratic Action party on Twitter identified Campos as the group's youth secretary in Sucre, a state in northern Venezuela east of the nation's capital.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxThe deaths bring the total to at least 122 killed in nearly four months of political upheaval.Demonstrators watch a barricade burn after clashes broke out while the Constituent Assembly election is being carried out in Caracas, Venezuela, on Sun., July 30, 2017. ReutersMeanwhile, Venezuelans appeared to be abstaining in massive numbers on Sunday in a show of silent protest against a vote to select a constitutional assembly giving the government virtually unlimited powers.Associated Press journalists toured more than two dozen polling places in neighborhoods across the capital, including many traditional strongholds of the ruling socialist party in southern and western Caracas. Virtually all the polling places saw hours-long lines of thousands of people in past elections over the last two decades of socialist government.One site, a sports and cultural complex known as the Poliedro, had several thousand people waiting about two hours to vote, many having traveled from opposition-dominated neighborhoods where polling places were closed. Of the dozens of others sites seen by the AP, two in the loyalist-heavy neighborhood of El Valle had lines of approximately 200 to 400 people. All the others had at most a couple of dozen voters, and many had less than a half-dozen or were completely empty.Opinion polls say more than 70 percent of the country is opposed to Sunday's vote.\"People aren't in agreement with this,\" said Daniel Ponza, a 33-year-old drywall contractor, as he watched a few dozen people outside a polling place in El Valle. \"People are dying of hunger, looking for food in the trash. And I think this is just going to make things worse.\"Sunday evening, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations sent a message on Twitter calling the Venezuela election a \"sham\" and \"step toward dictatorship\":Maduro\u2019s sham election is another step toward dictatorship. We won't accept an illegit govt. The Venezuelan ppl & democracy will prevail. \u2014 Nikki Haley (@nikkihaley) July 30, 2017In opposition-dominated eastern Caracas, riot police used tear gas to stop protesters from gathering for a march on the capital's main highway. At least three police were wounded when one of their motorcycles detonated in a powerful explosion. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear.After voting at dawn, President Nicolas Maduro called for international acceptance of what he called his government's fight against a violent opposition trying to sabotage his administration.Motorcycles burn after clashes broke out while the Constituent Assembly election was being carried out in Caracas, Venezuela, on Sun., July 30, 2017. ReutersThe run-up to the vote has been marked by months of clashes between protesters and the government that have left at least 116 dead and nearly 2,000 wounded. A 61-year-old nurse was fatally shot by men accused of being pro-government paramilitaries during a protest at a church a few hundred feet from the school where Maduro voted.\"We've stoically withstood the terrorist, criminal violence,\" Maduro said. \"Hopefully the world will respectfully extend its arms toward our country.\"In an unusual moment this morning when Maduro cast his own ballot on state-controlled national television, his national ID card was to be scanned. He intended to make a statement that his vote was counted and said: \"We are going to verify my national ID card so that the record shows that I came to vote and my ID card will show this for posterity, that I voted on this historic day of the constituent assembly of July 30th.\"Nicolas Maduro having his national ID card scanned. ReutersWhen the female official of the National Electoral Council (CNE) proceeds to use a smartphone to scan Maduro's card, a second camera zooms in to reveal that according to CNE's own system, that \"person does not exist, or the card has been revoked.\"After scanning Maduro's national ID card, the smartphone read: \"person does not exist, or the card has been revoked.\" ReutersMaduro appears livid but doesn't acknowledge the misshap, pauses for a second and then grabs his wife's ID card for scanning.Social media was abuzz with the misshap, which fanned the flames of speculation about the place of birth of the socialist president, whose mother is rumored to be a Colombian national. Following an opposition-mandated special commission investigation into the matter, the socialist-majority Supreme Court issued a ruling last October that stated that Maduro had been born in Caracas in 1962, but did not produce a birth certificate.Some opposition leaders continue to sustain that they have proof that Maduro was born a Colombian national, which would make him constitutionally ineligible to occupy the presidency.Maduro's highly vocal critic and former president of Colombia ridiculed Maduro in a tweet that reads: \"My fellow countryman, didn't they let you vote?\"Paisano \u00bf No te dejaron votar? https://t.co/ouVWI4eMtS \u2014 Andr\u00e9s Pastrana A (@AndresPastrana_) July 30, 2017Despite that hiccup, the opposition is boycotting Sunday's vote, contending the election has been structured to ensure Maduro's socialist party continues to dominate. So all 5,500 candidates for the 545 seats in the constituent assembly are his supporters and the vote's success is being measured by turnout.The government is encouraging participation with tactics that include offering social benefits like subsidized food to the poor and threatening state workers' jobs if they don't vote.\"I'm here because I'm hoping for housing,\" said Luisa Marquez, a 46-year-old hairdresser.Others said they were there out of conviction that the constitutional assembly would help the government fend off what they called an international capitalist conspiracy to undermine Venezuela's socialist system with the help of the domestic opposition.\"The crisis, the shortages of food and medicine, that isn't the government's fault,\" said Luis Osuna, a 42-year-old private bodyguard. \"Those who are attacking us to kill us with hunger and blame the government are the same enemies the government's always had.\"Women shout slogans during a protest held by Venezuelans in Spain against Venezuela's Constituent Assembly election, in Madrid, Spain, on July 30, 2017. ReutersOnce one of Latin America's wealthiest nations, Venezuela has spiraled into a devastating crisis during Maduro's four years in power, thanks to plunging oil prices and widespread corruption and mismanagement. Inflation and homicide rates are among the world's highest and widespread shortages of food and medicine have citizens dying of preventable illnesses and rooting through trash to feed themselves.The special assembly being selected Sunday will have powers to rewrite the country's 1999 constitution but will also have powers above and beyond other state institutions, including the opposition-controlled congress.While opinion polls say a vast majority oppose him, Maduro made clear in a televised address Saturday evening that he intends to use the assembly to govern without limitation, describing the vote as \"the election of a power that's above and beyond every other.\"He said he wants the assembly to strip opposition legislators of their constitutional immunity from prosecution and indicated he eager to prosecute many more members of the opposition parties that control a handful of state governments along with the National Assembly, providing one of the few remaining checks on the power of the socialist party that has ruled this OPEC nation for nearly two decades.\"The right wing already has its prison cell waiting,\" the president said. \"All the criminals will go to prison for the crimes they've committed.\"Saying the assembly will begin to govern within a week, Maduro said its first task in rewriting the constitution will be \"a total transformation\" of the office of Venezuela's chief prosecutor, a former government loyalist who has become the highest-ranking official to publicly split from the president.The Trump administration has imposed successive rounds of sanctions on high-ranking members of Maduro's administration, with the support of countries including Mexico, Colombia and Panama. Vice President Mike Pence promised on Friday that the U.S. would take \"strong and swift economic actions\" if the vote went ahead. He didn't say whether the U.S. would sanction Venezuelan oil imports, a measure with the potential to undermine Maduro but cause an even deeper humanitarian crisis here.Maduro's supporters on the Supreme Court set off the protests and clashes between police and demonstrator when they tried to strip the National Assembly of its powers in April. Most of the dead have been protesters apparently shot by police and government-linked paramilitaries.The opposition has organized a series of work stoppages as well as a July 16 protest vote that it said drew more than 7.5 million symbolic votes against the constitutional assembly.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle burn <extra_id_0> Artifact barricade <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle detonated <extra_id_0> Artifact motorcycles <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle burn <extra_id_0> Artifact Motorcycles <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Counting civilian casualties in CIA\u2019s drone warA report released in September by human rights researchers at Stanford Law School and New York University Law School sets out to demonstrate that U.S. drone policies are \"damaging and counterproductive.\"Media outlets from CNN to BBC hailed the report as new evidence of the U.S. government\u2019s false narrative on drones and the New York Times\u2018 Scott Shane described the study as \"among the most thorough on the subject to date.\"While the Stanford-NYU report certainly presents a comprehensive review of existing drone research, its new contributions to the evidentiary record are far more modest than its sweeping conclusions would suggest.Number CrunchingThe U.S. government claims that civilian casualties caused by drones are in the \"single digits\" during Obama\u2019s years in office, while the Stanford-NYU report seeks to establish that there is significant evidence that U.S. drone strikes have killed and injured a larger number of civilians. This is a low bar, and would merely necessitate proving that more than 10 civilians have been killed by drones since Obama assumed office, a claim that has been made by all three major databases aggregating information on drone strikes. The Stanford-NYU report goes further, claiming that between 474 and 881 civilians have been killed since 2004.However, this does not represent new evidence. Stanford and NYU researchers made no attempt to offer new statistical analysis on the number of civilian casualties caused by drones. Rather, their report is essentially an extended endorsement of a database compiled by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a small team of journalists based out of City University, London. In doing so, the report rejects the findings of two other widely cited databases, The Long War Journal, which reports 138 civilian deaths and New America Foundation\u2019s Year of the Drone, which lists 152-191 civilian deaths and the deaths of 130-268 \"unknowns.\"If the Stanford-NYU team wants to paint a picture of the U.S. as a human rights abuser, then the Bureau, whose casualty statistics dwarf the more conservative estimates of the other databases, is best suited to that purpose, but that does not make it the most reliable source.While a comprehensive assessment of the Bureau\u2019s data should have been conducted before giving it a resounding endorsement, just a cursory review of its account of 2012\u2019s drone strikes reveals problems:\u2013 On May 5, 2012 the Bureau reports that a strike in North Waziristan killed 8-10 people, of whom between zero and ten are listed as civilians. Upon reviewing the accompanying sources one find that early reports said the identity of the dead could not be determined, but subsequent reports from government officials identified them as militants. Of the 15 sources cited by the Bureau, not one states that the victims were civilians.-On June 2, 2012 the Bureau reports that 2-4 people were killed and between zero and two of them were civilians. These civilian deaths were inferred based on a report that a motorbike was accidentally hit, but the Bureau fails to take note of a later report from The Express Tribune identifying the motorbike victims as suspected militants Khalil Yargul Khail and Rehmanullah Gangi Khail.-On July 23, 2012 the Bureau references 25 sources for a drone strike, only one of which described the victims as local residents and based on this the Bureau reports that up to 14 civilians were killed.The Stanford-NYU report critiques the Long War Journal for not making its data available in a verifiable strike-by-strike format, over-relying on U.S. intelligence sources, and identifying all victims as militants unless they are specifically identified as civilians. These are reasonable criticisms, but when the critique turns to New America Foundation research, it becomes logically inconsistent.While Stanford-NYU researchers admit that all three databases rely on \"the same universe of publicly available press reports,\" they criticize only the New America Foundation for over-relying on the anonymous Pakistani government officials cited in such news reports. The Stanford-NYU report laments that these officials are cited in 88% of articles referenced in New America\u2019s 2012 data but fails to consider that these same articles are referenced by the Bureau. Furthermore, the only reason the researchers were able to generate that statistic is because New America compiles a highly transparent summary of media sources relied on for each strike with a list of which sources reported which casualty estimates, something no other database provides.The Stanford-NYU report goes on to question the \"deep reporting\" capabilities of New America\u2019s sources (The New York Times, Reuters, AP, BBC, etc.) while uncritically accepting the veracity of reports from fringe outlets such as the Kuwait News Agency, the South Asian News Agency, Central Asia Online, and Punjab News, which are sometimes the sole sources for the Bureau\u2019s reports of civilian casualties.This is not to suggest that the Bureau\u2019s research is without merit, but it should be noted that it represents an interpretation of the facts with a bias toward reporting civilian casualties. The Bureau\u2019s database does not even have a category for reporting militant deaths. It seems counter-intuitive that the organization\u2019s researchers can have such absolute faith in their civilian casualty estimates, but not have the confidence to label any of the deceased as militants.And the Stanford-NYU team was not impartial. By the report\u2019s own admission, the research project it undertook in Pakistan to interview family members of drone strike victims was commissioned by Reprieve, a UK based advocacy organization. Reprieve, which filed two lawsuits on behalf of alleged drone victims in May of 2012, arranged, paid for and collaborated on many of the victim interviews conducted by the Stanford-NYU researchers.No database is perfect, but a strong argument could be made that the New America Foundation\u2019s policy of attempting to identify both militants and civilians while maintaining an explicit category for \"unknowns\" to represent the uncertainty surrounding many of the strikes is a more balanced representation of the facts. After all, if the public is to assess the efficacy of drone strikes then we need to consider the strikes that hit their targets as well as the ones that do not.Stanford and NYU\u2019s analysis of the three drone databases, in some respects, misses the forest for the trees. A comparison of the annual data collected by the Bureau with that compiled by the New America Foundation suggests that while their numbers may differ, their underlying findings are substantially similar. Both the Bureau and New America have observed a general decline in the percentage of civilian fatalities since the high in 2006, with a sharp decrease during the Obama administration. According to the Bureau\u2019s data, the proportion of civilians killed in drone strikes fell from 35 percent in 2008 under President Bush to 9 percent thus far in 2012. Similarly, New America reports that the rate of civilian and unknown casualties decreased from 23 percent in 2008 to 2 percent in 2012. This stands to reason when we consider that the Bureau tends to err on the side of assuming that unidentified dead or individuals of disputed identity are civilians, while New America prefers to accommodate ambiguity by listing \"unknowns\" and only reports a civilian or militant casualty when it is reported by two independent sources.If one takes the average number of civilian and unknown deaths counted by the New America Foundation from 2004-2012 as a percentage of the total number of people killed in drone strikes, the civilian and unknown deaths represent 15 percent of the total. The Bureau\u2019s data suggests that civilian deaths account for 22 percent of the total killed. These numbers are in fact, not so very far apart. And while the Bureau has criticized New America for reporting that in 2012, civilian deaths are approaching zero, the Bureau\u2019s own data suggests that the percentage of civilian casualties in 2012 is at nine percent, an all-time low and significantly less than the 23 percent the Bureau reports during Obama\u2019s first year in office. This suggests that the choice is not between two very different data sets, but rather two different interpretations of similar evidence. Contrary to the Stanford-NYU report\u2019s claims, the New America Foundation is not underreporting civilian casualties; its researchers have simply chosen not to feign certainty in the face of ambiguity.What They Didn\u2019t SayThe Stanford-NYU researchers also fail to incorporate evidence that might temper their claims. Their report makes numerous references to an AP investigative report that interviewed 80 villagers at the sites of the ten deadliest attacks in 2011 and 2012 but neglects its conclusions that \"a significant majority of the dead were combatants\" and the numbers of casualties gathered by AP investigators \"turned out to be very close to those given by Pakistani intelligence on the day of each strike.\"Numerous media accounts, including the LA Times, have highlighted that \"the [Stanford-NYU] study concludes that only about 2 percent of drone casualties are top militant leaders.\" The study reached no such conclusion. This claim is based on research conducted by New America and published last month on CNN. While the Stanford-NYU report summarily dismissed New America\u2019s militant and civilian casualty estimates, they have been quick to make this statistic a centerpiece of their argument. In doing so, they also take the conclusion out of context, and ignore the possible tactical utility of deliberately targeting low-level militants. Indeed, destroying communication centers, training camps and vehicles undermines the operational effectiveness of al-Qaeda and the Taliban, and quotes from operatives of the Pakistan-based Haqqani Network reveal that drones have forced them into a \"jungle existence\" where they fear for the lives on a daily basis.A second key contention of the Stanford-NYU report is that drone strikes are \"damaging and counterproductive\" to U.S. national security. However, it is shortsighted to evaluate U.S. security in isolation from Pakistani domestic order. Terrorist attacks have been a pervasive problem in Pakistan, especially since 2007. While the report references these attacks and the frequent assassinations carried out by Taliban forces, it makes no reference to recent research by an analyst at the RAND Corporation, who identifies a negative correlation between drone strikes and militant violence inside Pakistan, indicating that the rate of violence has gone down as the rate of drone strikes has gone up. Analysis by New America suggests that while only 10 percent of drone strikes target al-Qaeda operatives, approximately 50 percent hit Taliban targets and in 2009, 19 of the first 32 drone strikes targeted the organization of Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban who was ultimately responsible for the deaths of thousands of Pakistanis, and the alleged mastermind of the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Mehsud was a far greater threat to Pakistani security than that of the United States.Key FindingsThese criticisms are not to suggest that the Stanford-NYU report is without merit. The anecdotal evidence on the adverse mental health impact of drones, the economic hardships created by attacks and the restriction of movement caused by FATA residents\u2019 anxiety about potential strikes are all valuable contributions to the public\u2019s understanding of drones, as is the report\u2019s succinct and cogent summary of some of the key legal issues. Both of these topics merit further research and the teams at Stanford and NYU seem well poised to continue contributing in these areas.However it would be a mistake to unequivocally accept all of the report\u2019s conclusions or its stance on the civilian casualty debate. The U.S. government\u2019s claims that civilian casualties from drone strikes during Obama\u2019s term in office are in the single digits are manifestly untrue, but there is no need to overstate the rate of civilian deaths to make the point that drones strikes are legally suspect and morally hazardous.Meg Braun is a Rhodes Scholar and MPhil candidate in International Relations at Oxford, where she is researching the evolution of U.S. drone policy.

{"text": "SANTIAGO, CHILE - A former top Venezuelan security official says video reports from Sunday's drone attack on President Nicolas Maduro demonstrate serious shortcomings in the response of the bodyguards protecting the increasingly embattled leader.\"Maduro's security was shown to be deficient,\" said retired Venezuelan Vice Admiral Mario Carratu, who has headed security teams for previous Venezuelan presidents, in a telephone interview with VOA. \"His bodyguards were slow to react and seemed to lack an evacuation plan for the president.\"Carratu said video of the incident, in which two drones exploded near a reviewing stand without injuring Maduro, suggested the president's security detail did not have an effective evacuation plan in place.The former admiral's analysis dovetails with public comments from disaffected former Venezuelan military officers who have gone public with claims to have been responsible for the assassination attempt.\"We showed that the regime is vulnerable. We didn't make it, but it's a matter of time before we do,\" said Salvatore Lucchese, a former Caracas police chief now in exile.Venezuelan opposition activist Salvatore Lucchese Venezuelan opposition activist Salvatore Lucchese speaks during an interview with Reuters in Bogota, Colombia Aug. 6, 2018. Venezuelan opposition activist Salvatore Lucchese speaks during an interview with Reuters in Bogota, Colombia Aug. 6, 2018.Lucchese claimed to have been part of the plot in an interview with Reuters this week in which he called for an armed overthrow of Maduro's leftist regime.Maduro was addressing a ceremony of the paramilitary National Guard in central Caracas when he came under attack from two drones packed with explosives. The government claims that one of the drones was diverted electronically while the second crashed into a nearby apartment building.Carratu confirmed that Venezuela, a longtime ally of Cuba, has the technology to electronically penetrate and interfere with the electronic signals of aircraft. But he ridiculed claims made on Twitter by persons saying they were involved in the attack that the drones had been shot down with firearms.\"Plastic explosives can't be detonated with bullets. They more likely exploded prematurely due to poor preparations by the hit team,\" he said.Lucchese's claim of responsibility for the attack came Wednesday but could not be independently confirmed. Responsibility has been claimed by a confusing array of spokesmen purporting to represent former and active members of Venezuela's security services, going by various names including \"The Resistance,\" \"Fenix Group\" and \"Soldiers in T Shirts.\"Lucchese was jailed by the Venezuelan government in 2014 for refusing orders to suppress opposition protests in his city. He took up political activity upon his release in 2016, when he objected to political negotiations with Maduro, but fled the country shortly afterward to avoid being arrested again.He did not reveal his location in the Reuters interview, but members of the Venezuelan government assert that he is in neighboring Colombia, a country that Maduro accuses of backing attempts to topple him.Exiled Venezuelan opposition journalist Patricia Poleo, long known for her close connections with the military, broadcast a statement from Miami that she claimed had been issued by officers in Venezuela. It said the officers were resorting to \"armed struggle\" because \"the regime has consistently ignored the constitution.\"Some opposition leaders have cast doubts on the claims of responsibility, suggesting instead that the attack was staged by the government to justify further repression.Julio Borges, president of the Venezuelan parliame Julio Borges, president of the Venezuelan parliament, arrives for a meeting with Ernesto Macias, president of Colombia's Senate, at the Congress in Bogota, Colombia, Aug. 8, 2018. Julio Borges, president of the Venezuelan parliament, arrives for a meeting with Ernesto Macias, president of Colombia's Senate, at the Congress in Bogota, Colombia, Aug. 8, 2018.The Maduro government this week has rounded up a half dozen military officers it accused of conducting the attacks and has issued arrest warrants for at least two opposition leaders, including congressional Speaker Julio Borges, who is in Colombia.Lucchese's police background crisscrossed with that of police lnspector Oscar Perez,who last year attacked Venezuela's Supreme Court from a helicopter with hand grenades and machine-gun fire. The attack came as the court's seven judges assumed the powers of parliament to allow Maduro to rule autocratically.Perez also machine-gunned a building housing Maduro's new handpicked national assembly, which had just ousted Attorney General Luisa Ortega for accusing Maduro of corruption and authoritarian rule.The Caracas metropolitan police, which has been largely dissolved by the Maduro government, maintained close links with opposition leaders. Lucchese was a member of the same Christian democratic First Justice party as Caracas Mayor Leopoldo Lopez, one of the most charismatic anti- government leaders who has been repeatedly imprisoned by Maduro.Perez was a subordinate to Lucchese in the police criminal investigations unit and the special operations brigade. He was killed by the new national secret police, SEBIN, whose forces used rocket-propelled grenades against his safe house when they raided it some months ago.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Crash crashed <extra_id_0> Vehicle second <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place apartment building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> CrashObject apartment building <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target Nicolas Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> Target Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Target he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact broadcast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer SEBIN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack detonated <extra_id_0> Instrument explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice explosives <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee opposition leaders <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacked  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact meeting <extra_id_0> Participant Ernesto Macias <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact meeting <extra_id_0> Participant Ernesto Macias <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "(CNN) A federal appeals court ruled on Friday to vacate the death sentence of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , who along with his brother planted homemade bombs near the finish of the 2013 Boston Marathon, killing three spectators and injuring hundreds.The court also ruled to set aside three of his 30 convictions but said he will remain in federal prison for the rest of his life.The court ruled Tsarnaev should be given a new penalty phase trial, where a new set of jurors can again decide if he should be sentenced to death.Tsarnaev, now 27, will remain incarcerated and is being held at the nation's most secure federal prison in Florence, Colorado.\"And just to be crystal clear: Because we are affirming the convictions (excluding the three ... convictions) and the many life sentences imposed on those remaining counts (which Dzhokhar has not challenged), Dzhokhar will remain confined to prison for the rest of his life, with the only question remaining being whether the government will end his life by executing him,\" the opinion, authored by Circuit Court Judge Ojetta Rogeriee Thompson, says.Tsarnaev was convicted in 2015, including for the deaths of Krystle Campbell Lingzi Lu at the marathon and police officer Sean Collier, separately.Around-the-clock coverageTsarnaev's legal team had pushed to change the venue of the trial to a courthouse that wasn't so close to the site of the bombing, in the heart of a town so affected by the tragedy.The appeals court judges agreed, saying, \"One could not turn on the radio either without hearing something about these stunningly sad events.\"The appeals judges ruled that US District Court Judge George O'Toole, who oversaw Tsarnaev's trial, \"fell short\" of his promise to question jurors thoroughly enough to identify the degree to which they had been exposed to facts of the case through media coverage, \"providing sufficient ground to vacate his death sentences.\"Part of the appeals court's ruling was a decision to reverse three convictions for charges that Tsarnaev was carrying a firearm in connection with his possession of a pressure cooker bomb.The ruling tells the district court to enter judgments of acquittal on those charges, put together a new jury and preside over a new trial that strictly focuses on what penalty Tsarnaev should receive for the counts that are eligible for the death penalty.Tsarnaev's attorneys had filed a post-trial motion for judgments of acquittal on these convictions that the district court judge denied.CNN has reached out to Tsarnaev's legal team for comment on the ruling.The ruling also states that the judges make no judgment about whether Boston is a \"proper venue\" for a sentencing retrial, and says it is a decision that should be left to the US District Court for Massachusetts, where the initial trial was held.The US Attorney's office said: \"We are currently reviewing the opinion and are declining further comment at this time.\"Tsarnaev was 19 years old when he and his brother, Tamerlan, who was 26 years old at the time, went to Boston's Boylston Street shortly before 3 p.m. on April 15, 2013, to carry out their plotSurveillance video showed the brothers carrying the pressure cooker bombs in backpacks and moving through the crowd near the marathon finish line in what federal prosecutors called a coordinated attack.Tamerlan set off the first bomb, a 6-quart pressure cooker that contained gunpowder, nails and BBs, prosecutors said.The bomb killed Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager, and permanently injured several other people who lost their legs.The second pressure cooker bomb, carried in by Dzhokhar, went off 12 seconds later and killed two people, Martin and Lu, a graduate student from China.The bombings sparked a manhunt for days that shut down the city and resulted in wall-to-wall coverage of the search.The brothers, while on the run, killed Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier.After they stole an SUV, the two were chased by police.Tamerlan died in an explosive firefight with police in nearby Watertown.Dzhokhar was arrested a day later.Victims, families to relive another trialThe decision to order a new trial will be difficult for the families of victims, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said after the decision came down on Friday.\"I think the concern that some families have had from the very beginning was that this day was going to come, where they would have to relive another trial, and you know they shouldn't have to relive another trial,\" Walsh said.\"The only thing that I'll say is a positive ... this guy will never see the light of day again.He's going to live within those four walls.He got exactly what he deserved.\"Shortly after Tsarnaev was found guilty on all counts, the parents of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was killed in the bombing, publicly pleaded for prosecutors not to pursue the death sentence in the penalty phase of the trial.\"We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring,\" the parents wrote in a column in The Boston Globe.\"As long as the defendant is in the spotlight, we have no choice but to live a story told on his terms, not ours.The minute the defendant fades from our newspapers and TV screens is the minute we begin the process of rebuilding our lives and our family.\"CNN has reached out to the Richard family for comment on Friday's ruling.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentence

{"text": "Indonesian Police Receive Terrorist Threat Targeting BaliJAKARTA \u2014\u00a0In Indonesia there are growing concerns that more deadly attacks could follow last week\u2019 bombings in Jakarta by Islamist militants.Bali police Tuesday say they received an anonymous letter warning that the resort Island will be the next target for a terrorist assault.\"The letter was sent by an anonymous individual to Buleleng district, and the police are still conducting an investigation, and trying to find out who sent the letter. But again, I urge people in Bali not to be afraid, but they should stay alert,\" said Bali Police Chief Sugeng Priyanto.Authorities say they've increased security at shopping malls and other locations that draw crowds in Bali.In 2002, the popular resort island was targeted by Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), an Indonesia-based terrorist group with links to al-Qaida. The bombing of a club in Bali killed 202 people, mostly foreigners.The Bali bombing severely hurt Indonesia\u2019s tourism industry, and began a decade of deadly plots in Indonesia carried out by Southeast Asian militants affiliated with al-Qaida.Indonesia successfully combated the JI related terrorist threat through police action, intelligence operations and high profile criminal prosecutions.However, after last week's attack in the center of Jakarta that killed eight people, including four militants, Indonesian security forces are raising concerns that more and deadlier attacks could follow, carried out by groups inspired by Islamic State.Indonesian Special Police patrol at Ngurah Rai Airport in Denpasar on Indonesia's resort island of Bali on Jan. 15, 2016, one day after a series of explosions hit the Indonesian capital Jakarta.The Jakarta attack was the first of its kind in Southeast Asia to be attributed to Syria-based militant Islamists.Authorities say about 500 Indonesians have travelled to the Middle East to join the extremist group. About 100 are believed to have returned, although experts say only about 15 have combat experience.Jakarta back to normalSo far the renewed threat of terrorism has not instilled any widespread sense of panic or fear amongst Indonesians.A security personnel stand guard inside train carriage for women at Manggarai train station in Jakarta, Jan. 8, 2016.Life in Jakarta has quickly returned to normal, less than a week after the deadly attacks.On Tuesday the Starbucks coffee shop that was bombed remained closed and boarded up for repairs, but the memorial of flowers had been removed. Other shops have reopened and traffic at the busy intersection was congested as usual.'Ojek' heroThe \u201cojek\u201d motorcycle taxi drivers were again gathered at the intersection where the attack took place, waiting for their next fares.One of the \u201cojek\u201d drivers back at work is Muhamad Yunus, who has received widespread praise for the selfless courage he exhibited during the attack.The militant attackers last Thursday (January 14) set off two bombs, the first at the Starbucks and the second at a police traffic station in the middle of the intersection, near Jakarta's oldest department store, Sarinah.After the second explosion Yunus rushed to the police station to help the wounded even though the assailants were shooting at anyone in the area. He said he found a woman whose legs were severely injured and brought her to safety, away from the firefight.\u201cI got that woman and I told her, don\u2019t cry. Please be strong. Be strong. Please don\u2019t be sad,\u201d Yunus said.Yunus said he found out later that the woman and her nephew were stopped by the police for a traffic violation at the time of the blast. Her nephew died in the explosion.Kami tidak takutAfter the Jakarta attack there have been demonstrations by Indonesian Muslims to denounce terrorism and call for the government to eradicate radical militants and supporters of Islamic State in the country.A \"Pray for Jakarta\" message (top) is displayed on a screen as Indonesians gather outside the damaged Starbucks coffee shop in central Jakarta on Jan. 17, 2016 following the deadly gun and bomb attacks that rocked the city on Jan. 14.Indonesians also have started to use hashtags like \"PrayforJakarta\" and \"Kamitidaktakut\" or \"Wearenotafraid\" in English, on social media.Yunus\u2019s act of heroism has been held up as an example of Indonesia\u2019s resolve to stand up against terrorism.\u201cI am not afraid. We won\u2019t be scared any more,\u201d he said.Dismantling terror networksMeanwhile Indonesian authorities have promised to intensify their efforts to monitor radical networks in the country.Police believe the alleged mastermind of the Jakarta attack, an Indonesian fighting with Islamic State in Syria called Bahrun Naim, used social media to communicate his radical ideas to followers in Indonesia.In December police say they successfully disrupted plans by militants to launch a string of deadly attacks on Christmas and New Year celebrations, as well as against the country's Shia Muslim minority.Prior to last week, the last major attack in the world's most populous Muslim nation was the twin bombing of luxury hotels in Jakarta in 2009.Ade Irma in Jakarta contributed to this

{"text": "On 27 August 1975 a Provisional IRA bomb exploded without warning at the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey, England. There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured, some severely. Two off-duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing.==Background==In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven \"incident centres\" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit (ASU) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang (due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974.==The bombing==The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9:20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off-duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign (Phase Two) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people.==Aftermath==One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a \"carbon copy\" of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences. The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street. The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which, along with the bombings, caused the deaths of nearly 20 people, injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property.==See also==*Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1970\u201379)== References ==", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Caterham Arms public house <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caterham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Instrument bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place England <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> Attacker IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Oxford Street <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Injurer people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle blew <extra_id_0> Artifact roof <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place pub <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die deaths <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer unit <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim hundreds <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injurer unit <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle damage <extra_id_0> Artifact property <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Damager unit <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure lost <extra_id_0> Victim soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassination <extra_id_0> Target Edward Heath <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker Their <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack threw <extra_id_0> Attacker attackers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice a bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place bedroom <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuries <extra_id_0> Victim Some <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure losing <extra_id_0> Victim soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble planted <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler Balcombe Street Gang <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place house <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection monitor <extra_id_0> Observer centres <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble placed <extra_id_0> ManufacturerAssembler IRA <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Artifact bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Research charge <extra_id_0> Researcher officers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentences <extra_id_0> Defendant people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain caught <extra_id_0> Detainee they <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Balcombe Street <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact agreed <extra_id_0> Participant Northern Ireland Office <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

This city has not experienced such a day of death and destruction since the German blitz of 1941. With the callous lack of remorse now so typical of the Provos they audaciously accept responsibility for what was an operation clearly requiring considerable planning and manpower. Throughout the 32 counties Irish men and women should ponder how a virulent Nazi-style disregard for life can lodge In the hearts of our fellow countrymen; all the more virulent in that once again the Innocent have been the main sufferers. Hitler In his Berlin bunker decided that the German people were no longer worthy of him and deserved not to survive. Yesterday's dead and injured and testimony to something similarly rotten in our philosophy of life. Every Irishman and woman must stand appalled and ashamed at the horror of what was perpetuated In Belfast yesterday In the name of Irish unity. Belfast is rocked and racked by the most ferocious blitz yet mounted by the IRA. Not even the German bombs could inflict more devastation on the capital of Ulster in the last war. On this unforgettable day 26 bombs, borne by car and planted to take the greatest toll of life, shattered the bodies of men, women and children in a fiendish holocaust of murder and hate. The wanton killing of non-combatant men, women and children-the inevitable consequence of exploding so many bombs without adequate warning - is yet another cruel act which will not be forgotten.A wanton attack on innocent men,women and childrenTHE FOLLOWING STATEMENT WAS MADE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND, MR. WILLIAM WHITELAW, IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, 24 JULY 1972:- As the House will know, the City and people of Belfast suffered a murderous sequence of explosions last Friday. Most of the 27 explosions in Belfast that day occurred within a 3\u00bd hour period in the afternoon-at a time when, and at places where high civilian casualties must have been expected and intended. No adequate warnings were given. Seven civilians and two soldiers were killed and at least 130 civilians injured-many gravely. I hardly need point out that all sections of the community are indiscriminately affected by these outrages. Of the dead two were Roman Catholics. Of the 130 injured at least 40 were Roman Catholics. 53 were men and boys, 77 women and children. I am sure the whole House will wish to join with me in expressing sympathy to the families of all those involved in this wanton attack on innocent men, women and children. After the appallingly bloodthirsty and criminal events of last Friday, there cannot be any remaining shred of support for the men who perpetrate them. Even those sectors of Roman Catholic opinion throughout the world which have traditionally identified themselves with and perhaps given the benefit of the doubt to any group of men who claimed to speak for the Irish Republican movement can surely no longer continue to uphold the men who were responsible for Friday's horrible catalogue of slaughter. Supporters of the Republican movement in this country, in Northern Ireland, in the United States and elsewhere, will no doubt notice the revulsion in some circles in the Irish Republic. Since Parliament at the end of March entrusted the Government with complete responsibility for all administration in Northern Ireland, we have made the most patient and reasoned effort to secure the end of violence. No one can deny that Her Majesty's Government have now an absolutely unchallengeable right to ask this House, this country, and indeed the whole world for their support in an absolute determination to destroy the capacity of the IRA for further acts of inhumanity. They have degraded the human race, and it must now be clear to all that their sole object is to promote their aims by violence and by violence alone.DESTRUCTION In Oxford Street bus station where death came to six people and scores were injured. The station was crowded when the bomb exploded. It was the worst of the afternoon's 19 murderous bombings.DESTRUCTION at Smithfield bus station, scene of the first of the vicious series of attacks on innocent people. Mercifully the buses here seen ablaze had not started filling up with passengers.DESTRUCTION in York Road railway terminus where the bomb was in an innocent-looking suitcase left on the platform.Letters to the Editor Funeral with no shouted commandsbut only sobs of four small childrenTO-DAY (Monday) I went to a funeral-that of one of \"Bloody Friday's\" victims. It wasn't one of those funerals we know so well in Belfast, with the uniformed men, the ceremonial shots, the shouted commands, the graveside oration. The only uniforms were the black and white vestments of the clergy. The only arms were those of Christ crucified on the Cross which led the Cortege. No shouted commands- only the sobbing of four small children. No graveside oration, only the tears in the eyes of a husband as final tribute. If there is power in the sobs of children and the tears of husbands and fathers, wives and mothers then the cause espoused by the terrorist is on the point of death: its followers now are but walking. dead, animated husks, soulless and mindless. rejected and disowned by any creature capable of pity and compassion. The earth which thudded on that coffin covered only a body, not the bestial deed which sent it there, an ever-pointing finger of condemnation to all involved - the terrorists who planned the bombing campaign, the terrorists who made the bombs, the terrorists who planted them: the politicians who wouldn't talk until all their demands were met and the politicians who talked too much and too often said the wrong thing; the leading churchmen, who merely mouthed pious attitudes. condemning violence in general but never aiming at specific deeds and organisations: The trade unionists who permitted discrimination to be the unwritten rule in our industrial life and the industrialists and businessmen who bowed to this evil on their premises; the neighbours, who were true neighbours and friends-until intimidation entered their street. To-day's victim had the dignity and honour of innocence and motherhood to take to her grave and Maker, and leaves her legacy of a peace-loving, and In the course of time, happy family. Her killers will face their Maker with her blood and many others on their hands and can only leave a. their legacy hatred, sorrow and despair.A FACE IN THE CROWD,Belfast 13.DESTRUCTION In Botanic Avenue after a bomb exploded in a hi-jacked bread van parked outside the York Hotel. Cars and houses suffered in the blast and there were the inevitable casualties.DESTRUCTION at the busy Antrim Road-Limeston Road corner. The wreckage in the forefront is all that was left of the stolen van in which the bomb had been planted. Women shoppers were among the casualties.DESTRUCTION at the shopping centre on the Cavehill Road, where one of the last of the bombs killed three people, including a mother of seven and a boy of 14.REPORTS 'Streets swept by terror' \"Such warnings as were given were so vague and imprecise as to be almost useless; For much of the afternoon Belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic. Girls and men wept openly, hugging each other for safety in the main streets as plumes of smoke rose around them and dull thuds echoed from wall to wall. It was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe As each bomb exploded there were cries of terror from people who thought they had found sanctuary but in fact were just as exposed as before. Report in the Guardian.'A day of horror and shame' Friday, July 21, 1972, was a day of horror and shame in this stricken city. Even hardened newsmen recoiled with shock from the scenes of carnage witnessed in Belfast as firemen lifted the mangled bodies where bombs ripped through crowds of unsuspecting men, women and children at bus depots and other locations. In all my years of journalism, which included the worst days of the wartime blitzes, I have never seen scenes so horrible in this city and one felt a deep feeling of anger and shame that such deeds were planned and carried out by fellow Irishmen. All Ireland has been shamed by the events of this terrible July afternoon in Belfast. Report in the Irish Independent, Dublin.'A deed of sick men' \"The chief injury is not to the British Army, to the Establishment or to big business but to the plain people of Belfast and Ireland. Anyone who supports violence from any s i d e after yesterday's events is sick with the same affliction as those who did the deed. \"Can anyone now believe that anything worth while can be established by these methods? That the country of anyone's vision can live with more memories of this kind?\" \"Irish Times\", Dublin. 'The cold-blooded, co-ordinated bomb outrages are a shocking crime against an already innocent population who have already suffered too much. These were brutal murders which will be totally condemned by every decent person in the United Kingdom.'Mr. Harold Wilson, Leader of the OppositionTHE BOMBERS STRIKE - AND THIS IS SOME OF THE SUFFERING THEY LEFTScenes of anguish in Oxford Street Bus Station where six people died - as pictured in the Daily Express \"A black sin ... that will never be erased\" By the Editor of theSunday IndependentDublin These are dark days for Ireland. We live in an age of cowardice, with the guilt spread evenly between the highest and the lowest in the land. We fostered the men who planned the murders of innocent men, women, boys and girls in Belfast on Friday. We fed these people with propaganda. We took advantage, when we could, of their exploits. And because we are not a morally courageous people, we never seriously tried to stop their terrible excesses. Those among us who could have acted to halt the course of tragedy preferred to do nothing. Those who could have spoken out, when words might have meant something, chose to hold their tongues. And the rest of us were content to let matters slide. Now all of us must pay the price for this neglect. There is a black sin on the face of Irish Republicanism today that will never be erased. Murder now lies at the feet of the Irish nation and there is no gain-saying that fact. We cannot change past, however much we regret its record. But if we wish to restore the honour of our people, now is the time to act. We must break the paralysis that leaves the good name of the Irish people in the hands of unscrupulous men. And we must find a way to make restitution for our failings. The gallantry of those who planted bombs in the middle of Belfast's shopping areas on Friday (and then ran like hell) will be sanctified by the almighty god of Irish republicanism and reverently embalmed- in what we are pleased to call our national heritage. We won't have a ballad to commemorate the butchered fragments of a woman we saw on the telly being shovelled up by a fireman. Who said Dan Breen is dead? His spirit is alive and well and looking forward to a cosy corner in whatever parliamentary system we are going to have for the next 50 years.

{"text": "CNN interviews man claiming to be Maduro assassination attempt organizerImage: CNNIn this frame from CNN footage aired on March 14, a DJI Matrice M600 Pro equipped with the A3 Pro positioning system (the white discs), apparently the same model used in the attack in Caracas last August.Cable News Network (CNN), the American news outlet, has published a report with video following an interview with a man claiming to be the organizer of the August 4 assassination attempt in Caracas on Venezuela\u2019s president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, using two drones.Seven people were injured in the two explosions.A number of arrests were made following the attack, but it is unclear if the suspects had anything to do with the incident.The man, whose identity was not revealed, provided CNN with cellphone footage said to be from a rented farm at a remote site in Columbia.The videos show men unboxing and assembling two D\u00e0-Ji\u0101ng Innovations (DJI) Matrice M600 Pro c-drones on a billiards table.Scenes purporting to show an explosive charge mounted underneath one of the drones and a DJI flight controller were partially blurred by CNN editors.Video footage said to be taken on the grounds of the farmhouse show two DJI Phantom quadcopter drones being flown simultaneously in what was described as practice piloting.CNN did not specify that the Phantom quadcopters shown in the practice runs differ from the larger M600 Pro hexacopters shown being prepared for the attack.The man interviewed claimed that following the assassination attempt, he met with US officials on three occasions to answer their questions and solicit assistance, which he said was not forthcoming.The footage shows clearly that both of the M600 Pro drones are equipped with DJI\u2019s A3 Pro positioning system, a set of three redundant GPS units and controllers meant to provide more precise and reliable positioning than the stock single A3 system delivered on the original M600 model.The C-Drone Review had identified such a three-sensor system on one of the M600 drones which exploded in August from analysis of Telemundo footage.Although CNN in their report said the drones used in the attack were \"small\", the M600 Pro model is an industrial-grade hexacopter c-drone with a payload of 13lb (6kg) and is larger than the Phantom models shown flying in the footage.Video from last August in Caracas shows that the landing struts of the M600 Pros had been removed, lightening the drones for their one-way trips.The M600 Pro folds to a smaller size than the original M600; CNN said in their report they were told that the drones used in the attack were dismantled, taken over the border from Columbia to Venezuela, and reassembled there.Contacted, DJI could not definitively confirm that some of its drones appear in the footage aired by CNN, although that appears to be the case.A spokesman for DJI, Adam Lisberg, sent the following statement to the C-Drone Review:DJI makes drones entirely for peaceful purposes, and we absolutely deplore any attempt to use our drones to cause harm.We build safety features into our products to help drone pilots avoid flying in restricted areas, and we developed our AeroScope system to allow authorities to remotely identify and track airborne drones.We have little ability to control what people do with our products after purchase, but anyone who deliberately misuses our products should expect to be held responsible for their actions.Venezuela is in crisis, with widespread shortages of staple foodstuffs and medical supplies, rolling power outages, and thousands of inhabitants leaving the country every day.President Maduro has accused Columbia and the United States of conspiring against him, without proof.The US withdrew its last embassy personnel from Venezuela last week, as opposition politician Juan Guaid\u00f3 seeks to oust Maduro from power.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Contact interviews <extra_id_0> Participant man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact aired <extra_id_0> Communicator CNN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble equipped <extra_id_0> Artifact Matrice M600 Pro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components A3 Pro positioning system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact published <extra_id_0> Communicator CNN <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact interview <extra_id_0> Participant man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack explosions  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble assembling <extra_id_0> Components Matrice M600 Pro c-drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble mounted <extra_id_0> Artifact drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Components explosive charge <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle dismantled <extra_id_0> Artifact the drones used in the attack <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ManufactureAssemble reassembled <extra_id_0> Artifact the drones used in the attack <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact met <extra_id_0> Participant officials <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation flown <extra_id_0> Vehicle Phantom quadcopter drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack assassination <extra_id_0> Attacker man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target Nicol\u00e1s Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrests <extra_id_0> Detainee suspects <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize identified <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject three-sensor system <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict accused <extra_id_0> Defendant Columbia <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation withdrew <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact personnel <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize claimed <extra_id_0> Identifier The man interviewed <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "July 29, 2011 \u0097 -- When Army Pfc. Naser Jason Abdo, accused of plotting planning a deadly bombing and shooting attack on soldiers at Fort Hood, made his first appearance in court in Waco, Texas, today, he yelled the name of accused Fort Hood shooter Major Nidal Hasan.Hasan is facing the death penalty for allegedly killing 13 people and wounding more than 30 in an assault on Fort Hood in November 2009.Like Hasan, Abdo may have taken some of his inspiration from Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical American-born Islamic cleric who is among the leaders of the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). One senior U.S. official told ABC News that after Abdo was arrested at a Killeen, Texas hotel Wednesday, Abdo mentioned the name of al-Awlaki.Nidal Hasan had exchanged emails with Awlaki, according to U.S. authorities. Al-Awlaki is believed to have inspired several other terror plots in the U.S. as well, including the bungled Christmas Day underwear bombing of Northwest flight 253.According to senior law enforcement officials, when police searched Abdo's hotel room, in addition to firearms, ammunition and bomb-making materials, they also found an article from a jihadi magazine produced by al-Awlaki's organization, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.The officials told ABC News Abdo had apparently stashed in the room an article from the first issue of al Qaeda's \"Inspire\" magazine called \"How to Build a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.\"AQAP, a media-savvy affiliate of al Qaeda, has produced six issues of \"Inspire\" so far, each featuring praise for martyrs and instructional sections on firearms and explosives for the prospective terrorist.Abdo was charged Friday with the federal crime of possession of a non-registered firearm in addition to previous charges of possession of child pornography and going AWOL from his unit. As he was being led from the courtroom, he yelled out, \"Nidal Hasan!\", \"Fort Hood!\", and \"2009!\".READ: Soldier Arrested in Alleged Fort Hood PlotAbdo Went AWOL July 4Abdo, a Muslim soldier who was in the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell more than 800 miles away in Kentucky, attempted to leave the military in 2010 after protesting the U.S.'s involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.In August 2010 he told ABC News he should not have to participate in what he called an \"unjust war\".\"Any Muslim who knows his religion or maybe takes into account what his religion says can find out very clearly why he should not participate in the U.S. military,\" Abdo said then.READ: Devout Muslim Hopes to Avoid Deployment to AfghanistanThe Army approved Abdo's request to be discharged as a conscientious objector, but just days later the discharge was put on hold and he was charged with having child pornography on his government-issued computer. Military investigators had been looking at Abdo's computer files after he made \"radical statements,\" law enforcement sources told ABC News.After he was told he would face a court martial, Abdo went AWOL from Fort Campbell on July 4. Though vocal in his protestations against the mission in the Middle East, Abdo did not make any public threats against the military.But when he was discovered Wednesday, Abdo was apparently in the final planning stages of a deadly attack. He was caught in part because a wary local gun store owner called police after Abdo visited the store to buy ammunition and gunpowder. He was acting \"suspicious,\" Guns Galore owner Greg Ebert told ABC News.\"There was clearly something wrong with him,\" Ebert said. \"We made a decision to call the police and fortunately it worked out.\"After his arrest, Abdo admitted he planned to plant two bombs at a local restaurant frequented by Fort Hood soldiers and hoped to gun down any survivors of the dual blast, according to law enforcement documents obtained by ABC News.According to the documents, military officials believe the incident \"was likely isolated to the Fort Hood area and the suspect in custody, and that arrest of the suspect has mitigated any further threats related to this incident.\"Abdo's former lawyer, James M. Branum, declined to comment for an ABC News report except to say Thursday he hasn't spoken with his client \"in a long time.\"ABC News' Sarah Netter, Luis Martinez and Lee Ferran contributed to this report.Click Here for the Blotter Homepage.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Attacker Naser Jason Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Fort Hood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact emails <extra_id_0> Participant Nidal Hasan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection searched <extra_id_0> Observer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place room <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation led <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin courtroom <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain Arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Soldier <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Fort Hood <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation Went <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation Deployment <extra_id_0> Destination Afghanistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Muslim <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> EndPosition discharged <extra_id_0> Employee Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> PlaceOfEmployment Army <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charged <extra_id_0> Defendant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Inspection looking <extra_id_0> ObservedEntity Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Observer investigators <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict face <extra_id_0> Defendant he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> JudgeCourt court <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation went <extra_id_0> Transporter Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Origin Fort Campbell <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact protestations <extra_id_0> Communicator his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ThreatenCoerce threats <extra_id_0> Communicator Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient military <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell buy <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity gunpowder <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Giver Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact called <extra_id_0> Participant owner <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant Greg Ebert <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic He <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact call <extra_id_0> Participant We <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrest <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact say <extra_id_0> Participant ABC News <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact spoken <extra_id_0> Participant client <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place hotel <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact told <extra_id_0> Participant ABC News <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack bombing <extra_id_0> Target flight 253 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Instrument underwear <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime possession  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime AWOL <extra_id_0> Perpetrator his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime pornography <extra_id_0> Victim child <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation going  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact yelled out <extra_id_0> Communicator he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic 2009 <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime AWOL <extra_id_0> Perpetrator Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protesting <extra_id_0> Target U.S <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Topic Afghanistan <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrator Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack war  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> EndPosition discharge  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime pornography <extra_id_0> Perpetrator his <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime AWOL <extra_id_0> Perpetrator Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack <extra_id_0> Attacker Abdo <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack gun down <extra_id_0> Target survivors <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack plant <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bombs <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attacker he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place restaurant <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blast  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain custody <extra_id_0> Detainee suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

The stories I heard were\u2026 remarkably similar.Jos\u00e9 at FerromineraAt Ferrominera, the big mining company in Guayana, workers are being forced to vote for the Constituent Assembly. The deal is simple: vote or you\u2019re fired. At each department, the manager is responsible for making sure his people vote.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get fired,\u201d he says. \u201cMy daughter is in the hospital.\u201dThere\u2019s nothing subtle about it. The order comes face-to-face, in notices and even via text message. Employees must go to meetings where the order is to vote. Nobody cares who they vote for \u2014this is a single party election, man. Managers are required to make lists with the ID numbers of the employees voting, and send them to human resources by Monday.Jos\u00e9 \u2014not his real name\u2014 has worked at Ferrominera for 15 years. \u201cThey make everyone vote, especially those in higher positions.\u201dJos\u00e9 isn\u2019t voting, though. He\u2019s not wealthy and he doesn\u2019t have a plan B if they fire him, but he\u2019s taking the chance.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get fired,\u201d he says. \u201cMy daughter is in the hospital, I guess my wife and I will go with her.

But, he adds, many others are compelled out of fear.Maria\u2019s mom at PDVSAMartha \u2014like all names, changed for this story\u2014 wouldn\u2019t talk to me. I had to approach her daughter Mar\u00eda instead. She talked to me in secret, without telling her mom. \u201cI know her, there\u2019s no way she\u2019ll agree to an interview. She\u2019s too scared\u201d.She must report to her boss the exact voting center she went to, and the time she went at.Martha didn\u2019t go to the vote drill. Her boss harassed her and the other employees with constant texts, but there was only one voting center in Ciudad Guayana, and it was too far to consider it.For the real thing, the pressure is absurd. She must report to her boss the exact voting center she went to, and the time she went at. Martha will try a null vote.

Her dad has been working for the big aluminum-maker way before chavismo was a thing: 25 years total.I just wish they burn all of the voting machines, so no one can vote.

As soldiers, they have to follow orders, or face trial by insubordination.I wish I could reveal more about my guy, but he wouldn\u2019t let me. He\u2019s a military officer and it\u2019s from el interior. He doesn\u2019t want to vote, and his plan is to show up, say hi and walk out. By showing himself, he thinks, he\u2019ll be off the hook.I reached out to people at two other state companies, but they refused to talk, even after I offered to change their names.

{"text": "By MARI YAMAGUCHI, Associated PressTOKYO (AP) \u2014 Japanese police have arrested a man who admitted to landing a drone with low-level radioactive sand on the roof of the prime minister's office to protest the government's nuclear energy policy, officials said Saturday.Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto, 40, turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan.The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices, the prime ministers' office has said. The infiltration at Japan's political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there.No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident.Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister's office. He has not been indicted and faces further questioning.Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government's nuclear energy policy.Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan's 48 reactors, which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami-triggered Fukushima plant disaster. Abe's administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible.The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium, levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment.The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima, where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai-ichi meltdowns, NHK said.The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities. Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial, service and entertainment use. At a meeting Friday, task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones.It is not clear exactly when the drone landed because workers at the office in central Tokyo rarely go up to the roof. An official taking new employees on a building tour reportedly spotted the drone.A blog with an anti-nuclear theme managed under the name \"Kantei (prime minister's office) Santa\" contained photos of a drone that looked like the one found Wednesday. In one entry, the anonymous writer said he drove from his hometown in Obama city in Fukui to Tokyo and flew the drone in the early hours of April 9, trying to have it land in the yard of the prime minister's office, but that he eventually lost track of the device.In the United States in January, a drone flown by an off-duty intelligence employee crashed on the White House grounds.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Jailer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Detainee man <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> IdentifyCategorize found <extra_id_0> IdentifiedObject drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Crash crashed  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DiseaseOutbreak disaster  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Yamamoto <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer Police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime obstructing duties  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Instrument unmanned aerial devices <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Investigators: NY Bombing Suspect Bought Parts on eBayFederal investigators say the suspect in Saturday's bombings in New York and New Jersey bought components on eBay and used as triggering devices cell phones purchased from a store 500 meters from an address he once listed as his home.The details are contained in criminal complaints made public Tuesday spelling out multiple federal charges against 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami. Most of the charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.Authorities arrested Rahami on Monday after an exchange of gunfire with police that left him and two officers wounded.According to the court documents, investigators believe Rahami used an eBay account with the username \"ahmad rahami\" to buy citric acid, a circuit board, electric igniters and hundreds of ball bearings between June 20 and August 10. The items were shipped to a business in Perth Amboy, New Jersey where Rahami worked until September 12.Ball bearings were found in two pressure cooker bombs placed four blocks apart in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York late Saturday. One of them exploded, injuring 29 people, while the other was recovered intact. Investigators said the second bomb had \"numerous\" electric igniters.Ahmad Khan Rahami is taken into custody after a shootout with police Monday, Sept. 19, 2016.That second device was tested for fingerprints, and the criminal complaint said all 12 prints found were matches for Rahami. The documents say his prints were also found on items inside of a backpack that was discovered late Sunday at a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, just outside of New York. The bag contained multiple explosive devices, including one that blew up as police tried to disarm it with a robot.Authorities also tied Rahami to a bomb that blew up in a trash can in Seaside Park, New Jersey early Saturday.That link involved one of the cell phones that investigators said were shipped last year to a store in Perth Amboy near the address that Rahami provided as his home in a 2012 passport application. They said a second phone shipped to the same place was used in the bomb that blew up in Chelsea.A third phone, one found with the other Chelsea bomb, was once registered to one of Rahami's family members, the documents said.Investigators also said they used surveillance video to tie Rahami to the Chelsea bombs, with cameras putting him near the explosion site about 37 minutes before the blast and near where the other bomb was found two minutes after the first one went off. That second video, they said, showed him pulling a suitcase and then a short time later walking without it.The documents contain some pieces of writing from a journal found on Rahami when he was arrested. The messages include praise of American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011, and \"Brother Osama Bin Laden,\" the former head of al-Qaida who was killed by U.S. forces in Pakistan in 2011.\"Inshallah the sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets. Gun shots to your police. Death To Your OPPRESSION,\" one message reads.The FBI said Tuesday it assessed Rahami's activities in 2014 after his father told agents he was concerned about his son's possible involvement with extremists.The agency found insufficient evidence to warrant further investigation.Rahami was born in Afghanistan, came to the U.S. at age 7 and became a naturalized American citizen.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell bought <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity components <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient suspect <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell purchased <extra_id_0> Giver store <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity cell phones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> GenericCrime criminal  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Sentence sentence  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ChargeIndict charges  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer Authorities <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim him <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ExchangeBuySell buy <extra_id_0> AcquiredEntity circuit board <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Recipient Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation shipped <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact items <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Destination New Jersey <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack exploded <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice them <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injuring <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle recovered <extra_id_0> Artifact other <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain custody <extra_id_0> Detainee Ahmad Khan Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Jailer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew up <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew up <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Seaside Park <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack blew up <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice bomb <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Chelsea <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack went off <extra_id_0> ExplosiveDevice one <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> ArrestJailDetain arrested <extra_id_0> Detainee Rahami <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim Anwar al-Awlaki <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> InvestigateCrime investigation <extra_id_0> Investigator agency <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle disarm <extra_id_0> Artifact it <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "Venezuela crisis: Maduro to raise fuel prices to combat smugglingVenezuela\u2019s heavily subsidised domestic fuel prices should rise to international levels to avoid billions of dollars in annual losses as a result of smuggling, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has said in a televised address.\"Gasoline must be sold at an international price to stop smuggling to Colombia and the Caribbean,\" the president said.Like most oil-producing countries, Venezuela has for decades subsidised fuel as a benefit to consumers.But its fuel prices have remained nearly flat for years despite hyperinflation that the International Monetary Fund has projected would reach 1 million per cent this year.That means that for the price of a cup of coffee, a driver can fill the tank of a small SUV nearly 9,000 times.Recently, the average price of a coffee with milk was 2.2m bolivars, or about 50 cents, local media has reported.Smugglers do brisk business reselling fuel in neighbouring countries.Quick guideWhy is Venezuela in crisis?Show Hide Under the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who ushered in Venezuela\u2019s socialist revolution in 1999, a new constitution and numerous elections placed nearly all government institutions under the control of the ruling Socialist party.This concentration of power was aided by a feuding opposition which carried out ineffectual campaigns and electoral boycotts.After Ch\u00e1vez died of cancer in 2013, he was succeeded by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro who is even less tolerant of dissent.Growing political authoritarianism has coincided with greater state dominance over the economy.But expropriations, price controls and mismanagement have led to a 40% contraction of the economy in the past five years.Oil accounts for 96% of Venezuela\u2019s export income but many foreign companies have been driven out and production has dropped to a 30-year low.The resulting fiscal crisis has prompted the government to print more money, which has led to hyperinflation and a collapse of the currency.It also means that the government can\u2019t import enough food and medicine to meet demand.Maduro has rejected economic reforms out of loyalty to socialism and because many government officials are allegedly getting rich off the economic distortions \u2013 through exchange rate scams and by selling scarce food on the black market.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Maduro said the government would still provide direct subsidies to citizens holding the \"fatherland card\", a state-issued identification card that the government uses to provide bonuses and track use of social services.He said the subsidy was only available to those who registered their cars in a vehicle census being conducted by the state.Venezuela has dirt-cheap fuel, so why is driving nearly impossible?Read moreOn Friday, the UN said that more than half a million Venezuelans had crossed into Ecuador this year as part of one of the largest mass migrations in Latin American history.About 547,000 citizens have entered Ecuador since January \u2013 mostly through its northern border with Colombia \u2013 to escape rampant crime and political violence, a collapsing economy and severe shortages of food and medicines.More than 1 million Venezuelans have also crossed into Colombia since the exodus began in 2015.Others have fanned out across Latin American and Caribbean nations including Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Trindad and Tobago.Tens of thousands have hiked into Brazil down a remote Amazon road known as the Hunger Highway.",

{"text": "An IRA member who was part of the group behind the Birmingham pub bombings has apologised.Michael Christopher Hayes \u2013 a self-confessed bomb maker \u2013 said he was sorry for the killing of innocent people in the 1974 blasts.Speaking to the BBC, Mr Hayes said he hoped his apology on behalf of all active republicans will help grieving relatives find \"closure\".He said: \"My apologies and my heartfelt sympathies to all of you, for the terrible, tragic loss that you've been put through. And all these years you've been trying to find closure. I hope at last God will be merciful and bring you closure.\"And I apologise not only for myself ... I apologise for all active republicans who had no intention of hurting anybody and sympathise with you.\"An eight-minute delay before police were warned of the bombs' location led to the death of 21 people and the injury of 182 others, when they exploded in a pair of city centre pubs. Mr Hayes said the bombs had not been intended to kill people.On the evening of the 21 November 1974, a man with an Irish accent called the Birmingham Post and Evening Mail newspapers to say two bombs were planted in the town centre.He finished the call by giving the official code used by the Provisional IRA to authenticate a warning call and allow civilians to be evacuated.Former IRA officials have since said there was an unintentional delay in issuing the warning.Mr Hayes said the IRA unit in Birmingham had been shocked by the death toll.\"That wasn't meant. It wouldn't have been done if that was the case,\" he said.The wreckage left at the Mulberry Bush pub in Birmingham after a bomb exploded on 21 November 1974 (PA)The Birmingham pub bombings caused the worst single losses of life in the Troubles. Six men were wrongfully convicted for the blasts but no-one has ever been brought to justice.Mr Hayes, 69, who now lives in south Dublin, said he personally defused a third bomb on Birmingham's Hagley Road after he became aware of the death toll in the first two blasts.He refused to say who planted the bombs in the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town but he said he wanted to speak out to give \"the point of view of a participant\".But relatives of those who were killed said the apology was \"gutless and spineless\".Mr Hayes' apology came as an inquest into the bombings was reopened by a coroner stating \"a wealth of evidence\" had not yet been heard.West Midland Police said their investigation remained open but that no further comments on the suspects' identities will be provided until the proceedings have concluded.Victims' families have repeatedly asked for the names of the suspects to be disclosed.Mr Hayes was arrested and questioned by West Midlands Police about the bombings in 1974 but he was released.He said he had been a member of the IRA for more than 30 years in both Ireland and England and had participated in the group's activities in Birmingham as \"an active volunteer\".UK news in pictures Show all 50 1 /50 UK news in pictures UK news in pictures 18 September 2020 A model presents a creation during the Bora Aksu catwalk show at London Fashion Week 2020 Reuters UK news in pictures 17 September 2020 World kickboxing champion Carl Thomas during his attempt to run a marathon while pulling a plane at Elvington Airfield near York.

{"text": "New York Gov.Andrew Cuomo (D) said Sunday that there is \u201cno evidence of an international terrorism connection\u201d in the explosion in Chelsea, though he stopped short of saying whoever caused the incident did not want to incite terror.AD\u201cIt depends on your definition of terrorism,\u201d Cuomo said.\u201cA bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism, but it\u2019s not linked to international terrorism.In other words, we find no ISIS connections.\u201dADHe said later: \u201cThis is the nightmare scenario.\u201dNot long after the blast, police said they had found another possible explosive device just blocks away.This device appeared to be similar to a pressure cooker and had wiring on it, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation.Pressure cookers were used in the two bombs detonated at the Boston Marathon in 2013.The bomb squad safely removed the second device, New York police tweeted early Sunday.Police officers, firefighters and other first responders had rushed to the scene of the blast, which closed a major roadway and forced people out of nearby buildings.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said Sunday that the explosion was \u201cintentional,\u201d but noted that few details were available because the investigation was in its early stages.\u201cWe know there was a bombing,\u201d de Blasio said.\u201cWe know it was a very serious incident, but we have a lot more work to do to be able to say what kind of motivation was behind this.\u201dADADHe also echoed his comments from Saturday night that there was no specific, credible threat against New York from any terrorist group.The FBI and NYPD are trying to understand what motivation lay behind the blast.\u201cWe will look at individuals.We will look at associations.We will look at social media,\u201d William Sweeney, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI New York Field Office, said.\u201cUntil we have that information it is not fair for us to give a conclusion [as to motivation],\u201d DeBlasio said.\u201cLet the law enforcement experts draw the conclusions.\u201dPolice Commissioner James O\u2019Neill, whose first day in the position was Saturday, told reporters on Sunday that police were still gathering evidence.AD\u201cWe did find some components indicative of an IED\u2026 that went off intentionally,\u201d O\u2019Neill said.Late Saturday, police had ruled out natural gas as a possible cause of the blast.ADThe New York Police Department\u2019s counterterrorism bureau responded to the explosion, along with officials with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.While O\u2019Neill said authorities were still trying to determine what, precisely, exploded, the NYPD counterterrorism bureau posted a photo online earlier Saturday showing what appeared to be a dumpster or garbage container mangled by a blast:Police in New York also reported shortly after 11 p.m. that they had found the \u201cpossible secondary device\u201d a few blocks away from the Chelsea explosion scene, on 27th Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues.Police directed people away from that intersection, and one officer could be heard telling pedestrians that \u201cthere is a possible explosive\u201d in the area.ADNot long after midnight, police said in a statement that they were asking people in the area of this potential explosive to move away from their windows \u201cuntil we clear the suspicious package,\u201d although officers did not fully evacuate the area.ADAccording to the Associated Press, the second device was removed with a robot and taken to the department firing range in the Bronx.O\u2019Neill said Sunday that two \u201cvery dedicated\u201d former New York state troopers had responded to the initial report of the blast last night.In a search for other explosives, they had parked their vehicle on 27th Street.Walking down the block, they found the second, unexploded device, O\u2019Neill said.ADReports of another suspicious package at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue turned out to be a false alarm \u2014 the package was only garbage, J. Peter Donald, a police spokesman, posted on Twitter around 12:30 a.m. Sunday.The Chelsea explosion occurred about 11 hours after a pipe bomb exploded in a Jersey Shore garbage can, shortly before a scheduled charity 5K race there benefiting Marines and Navy sailors.ADAuthorities have said they have not yet found anything connecting the Chelsea and New Jersey incidents but are continuing to investigate.On Sunday, Cuomo said the \u201cbombs\u201d in Chelsea \u201cappear to be different\u201d from those discovered earlier in the day in New Jersey, though the devices from both states were being shipped to the FBI lab in Quantico for further assessment.He said the devices in New Jersey were \u201cpipe bombs,\u201d and those in Chelsea were not.Cuomo said agents in New York were in touch with those in New Jersey.ADCuomo said officials \u201chave no reason to believe at this time that there is any further immediate threat,\u201d though the National Guard and the New York State Police were deploying an additional 1,000 personnel to bus terminals, airports and subways \u201cjust to err on the side of caution.\u201dADCuomo said the blast in Chelsea \u201ccaused significant property damage,\u201d though he a nearby subway station was structurally safe.He said law enforcement would work diligently to identify and locate those responsible.\u201cWhoever placed these bombs, we will find, and they will be brought to justice,\u201d Cuomo said.The explosion in the area of 23rd Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues occurred about 8:30 p.m. police said.Several of those injured were brought to area hospitals, Donald, the police spokesman, posted on Twitter.ADAll victims were treated and released by Sunday morning, Cuomo said.A spokeswoman for Lenox Health Greenwich Village, which treated nine of the victims, said patients were treated for minor injuries that included lacerations to the head and body.Other hospitals declined to provide specifics about the extent of patients\u2019 injuries from the explosion.ADPhotos and accounts posted on social media Saturday night showed large crowds \u2014 as well as a large law enforcement presence \u2014 in the area near where the explosion occurred.Soleil Filomena, 64, was leaving a convenience store at Seventh Avenue and 23rd Street when she heard the explosion.\u201cIt was so loud it just went through my whole body,\u201d she said.\u201cPeople started running up 23rd Street, and I started running with them.\u201dADFilomena said she saw a \u201cbig black cloud in the sky.\u201d After the explosion, she said her \u201cear was ringing for 15 minutes.\u201dWhen Keith Salomon of Delaware felt the explosion, he was having dinner a block and a half from the site of the blast.His chair and table shook, he said, and he saw people being taken away in ambulances.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know what it was and so, at first, we just kept eating,\u201d said Salomon, 52, who was visiting his son in the city.\u201cBut then we realized something was wrong.\u201dOthers did not hear the explosion but saw the aftermath.When Jacob Schulman left his apartment a few blocks away shortly before 9 p.m., he saw people running and screaming.AD\u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going on, but everyone looked so panicked.I started running.too,\u201d said Schulman, 26, who has lived in the neighborhood since 2014.Two blocks from the blast scene, a group of people emerged from a screening of the animated movie \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d and saw the flashing lights.One man who came out of the theater said he could not hear anything and had no idea about the explosion not far from where he was sitting.President Obama was briefed on the situation in New York and will be updated as more information becomes available, a White House official said late Saturday.Speaking in Colorado not long after the explosion, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump quickly commented on the situation before much information was known.\u201cI must tell you that just before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Trump shortly after getting off of his plane.His comments were made before authorities confirmed the nature of the explosion.Late Saturday, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said it was important to \u201cknow the facts\u201d before drawing conclusions about such incidents.Early Sunday, posts on social media from people in New York showed the area of the explosion to be relatively calm and quiet.Authorities had closed large swaths of roads in the area Saturday night.On Sunday, several roads had reopened but there remained a large police presence in the area.The explosion in New York comes as foreign leaders, including many heads of state, are heading to Manhattan for the United Nations General Assembly.Secretary of State John F. Kerry arrived Saturday, while Obama is scheduled to head to the city on Monday.This annual meeting \u2014 held more than two miles from the site of the explosion in Chelsea \u2014 is traditionally a challenging time for New York, as many roads are shut down and the heavy security leads to traffic jams.The FBI still has no determination as to motive, said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.Agents are examining the detonated material from the first device as well as studying the second, which appeared to resemble a pressure cooker.They are also looking at video from security cameras, social media \u2014 \u201call the logical leads,\u201d the official said.The explosion in Chelsea coincided with a separate attack that took place in Minnesota Saturday night, in which a man stabbed eight people in a St.Cloud mall before he was killed by an off-duty police officer.On Sunday, an ISIS-linked news agency claimed the mall attacker was \u201ca soldier of the Islamic State.\u201dAn FBI spokesman said in an emailed statement that the agency had not determined whether the stabbings were related to the bombing in Manhattan the same night.Speaking to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday morning, New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie (R) said there were no known links so far between the incident in New Jersey and those in New York and Minnesota.Authorities urged any witnesses with tips, video or other credible information about the explosion to call 1-800-577-TIPS.Berman and Wang reported from Washington.Renae Merle in New York

{"text": "Manchester Bomber\u2019s Blast Felt on Street Where He Grew UpMANCHESTER, ENGLAND \u2014\u00a0The British-born jihadist behind the worst terror attack in Britain in more than a decade in effect killed and maimed people he\u2019d grown up with \u2014 making the atrocity even more horrifying for Manchester residents still struggling to come to terms with a bombing that killed 22 people and injured 59 others at a concert of American pop star Ariana Grande.As the British government raised the terrorist threat level to \"critical\" \u2014 only the second time authorities have done so \u2014 details began to emerge of the 22-year-old suicide bomber Salman Abedi, his Libyan paternity, and his alleged ties to a well-known recruiter for the Islamic State terror group and other known jihadists.He only recently returned from a three-week trip to Libya, according to family members. British police sources say the trip raises the possibility he may have met with members of the terror group\u2019s affiliate in the North African country to plot the attack and to receive training.Known to police The portrait drawn of the mass killer who packed his improvised explosive device with nails, nuts and bolts to maximize the slaughter, is a mixed one.Some neighbors describe him as a football-obsessed fan of Manchester United and keen enthusiast of computer games.They insist there were no signs the student dropout became radicalized. British security services acknowledged Abedi was known to them \u2014 there are some reports the intelligence service may have tried to persuade him to act as an informant \u2014 but they did not see him as a high risk.Others, though, describe a young man full of rage, who denounced a local mosque leader for his criticism of IS. They say he started to pray openly in the streets.A police officer stands outside Didsbury mosque in Manchester, May 24, 2017.A local imam, Mohammed Saeed, told British newspapers Abedi stopped attending his mosque in 2015 after they argued over IS. \u201cSalman used to come to the mosque occasionally, he wasn\u2019t particularly friendly towards me because he didn\u2019t like my anti-IS sermons. He didn\u2019t like what I was saying and showed me the face of hate. He came to the mosque less and less after that.\u201dSon of Libyan emigresAbedi was born in Manchester in 1994, the third of four children, three boys and one girl. His parents were Libyan emigres who found a home in the northern English city after fleeing the Moammar Gadhafi regime in 1980.His father, Ramadan Abedi, a former security guard at Manchester Airport, returned to Libya in 2011 to join the uprising against the Libyan autocrat. Since Gadhafi\u2019s overthrow his parents spent more time in the North African country than in their home in south Manchester, less than two miles from the scene of Monday\u2019s bombing.Police officers arrive at a residential property on Elsmore Road in Fallowfield, Manchester, on May 24, 2017, as investigations continue into the May 22 terror attack at the Manchester Arena.Libyan emigres in Manchester say the bomber\u2019s father had no time for jihadist ideology. \u201cHe was always very confrontational with jihadi ideology, and this ISIS thing isn\u2019t even jihad, it\u2019s criminality. The family will be devastated,\u201d one told local newspapers.According to the Daily Mirror newspaper, Abedi was a family friend of Raphael Hostey, also known as Abu Qaqa al-Britani, who helped recruit other young Britons for Islamic State via social media until he was killed in a drone strike in Syria last year. British police sources say his ties to Hostey are being probed by counter-terror officials who fear Abedi may have been part of a terror cell, a concern heightened by a trip he made to Libya in the run-up to the bombing.Police also remain skeptical that Abedi could have built the bomb alone because of its sophistication.RadicalizationAbedi attended local schools and then went on to study business and management at nearby Salford University. In a statement, a university spokesman described him as \"completely off the radar. He turned up for lectures for two years and then just stopped coming.\u201dA sign on the front door of a house reads \"Stop Knocking On This Door - We Know Nothing About This Family!!\" is pictured on Elsmore Road in Fallowfield, Manchester, on May 24, 2017.In the last year-and-half both Abedi and his older brother, 23-year-old Ismail, were active on social media sites, praising jihadists. Police arrested Ismail Monday night hours after the blast. He taught Arabic classes at the Didsbury mosque and, according to locals, was reported to police after concerns were raised about what he was teaching.Police are also probing the links between the Abedi brothers and another British-Libyan from Manchester, Abdalraouf Abdallah, who was sentenced to a nine-year-prison term after being convicted of funding terrorism and preparing acts of terrorism.Some analysts argue there were plenty of warning signs about Abedi. In a recent study of young British jihadists for the Henry Jackson Society, a London-based think tank, researcher Emma Webb noted a failure of various agencies and educational institutions to share relevant information about individuals vulnerable to radicalization.She urged police and social services to share \u201crelevant information on vulnerable individuals so the full picture is known across all agencies.\u201d", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Injure maimed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim people <extra_id_1>

{"text": "Roadside IED kills Russian major general in SyriaThe desert south and east of Deir ez-Zor on the regime\u2019s side of the Euphrates is rife with insurgentsRussia\u2019s foray into Syria took yet another heavy toll this week, when that nation\u2019s Defense Ministry confirmed that a major general was killed in Syria by an improvised explosive device, Al-Monitor online reported.Major General Vyacheslav Gladkikh died after a roadside IED detonated under a convoy of Russian soldiers and Syrian pro-regime militiamen near the city of Deir ez-Zor.Three other Russian military personnel were wounded, Russia\u2019s state-run Tass news agency reported.A local commander of Syria\u2019s National Defense Forces, a pro-Assad militia, was also reportedly killed.\u201cThey\u2019ve changed their tactics there,\u201d said one source, who declined to be named for security reasons.\u201cThey do nighttime infiltrations, lay mines and booby traps.\u201dVideo purporting to show the explosion circulated on social media this week.It was the first reported death of a Russian general in Syria since 2017, when a lieutenant general was killed in the same province, reportedly by mortar fire from the Islamic State, Al-Monitor reported.Deir ez-Zor and nearly all of Syrian territory west of the Euphrates River lie in Syrian government hands, with the major exception of Idlib province, the last rebel enclave in the country\u2019s nearly decadelong civil war.US-backed and Kurdish-led militias captured IS\u2019 last remaining territory in March 2019, but the desert countryside south and east of Deir ez-Zor on the regime\u2019s side of the Euphrates is rife with insurgents who continue to ambush pro-Syrian regime forces, Al-Monitor reported.Syria\u2019s eastern Badia, or desert, remains the country\u2019s last significant hot spot of IS activity.In April, more than two dozen Syrian pro-regime fighters were killed in IS attacks in Badia al-Sukhnah and Badia al-Sham, prompting Russian airstrikes, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Killings of local tribal figures recently rocked the east side of the Euphrates in Deir ez-Zor, which is controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, Al-Monitor reported.It is not clear who carried out the slayings, though locals have alternatively blamed IS and the Assad regime.A US official told Al-Monitor last month that there could be anywhere from 2,000 to 10,000 IS insurgents in sleeper cells across Iraq and Syria.Coalition spokesman US Army Col. Myles Caggins III told Al-Monitor that the US recently provided Iraqi authorities with \u201cseveral million dollars\u2019 worth\u201d of border security infrastructure to interdict illicit smuggling in the border area.The Pentagon says US special forces at the isolated al-Tanf base in the Badia are there to keep pressure on IS in the border area, but rebels have told Al-Monitor that the proximity of Russian and Syrian forces on the roads outside the US-controlled zone make operations outside the area difficult.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Die kills <extra_id_0> Victim general <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Syria <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim general <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Al-Monitor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die died <extra_id_0> Victim Vyacheslav Gladkikh <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure wounded <extra_id_0> Victim personnel <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim commander <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim general <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place province <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Al-Monitor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Die killed <extra_id_0> Victim fighters <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Killer IS <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Al-Monitor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Al-Monitor <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacks <extra_id_0> Attacker IS <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Badia al-Sham <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation smuggling  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact confirmed <extra_id_0> Communicator Defense Ministry <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact reported <extra_id_0> Communicator Tass <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact said <extra_id_0> Communicator source <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
{"text": "The 2001 shoe bomb attempt was a failed bombing attempt that occurred on December 22, 2001, on American Airlines Flight 63.The aircraft, a Boeing 767-300 (registration N384AA) with 197 passengers and crew aboard, was flying from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France, to Miami International Airport in the U.S. state of Florida.The perpetrator, Richard Reid, was subdued by passengers after unsuccessfully attempting to detonate plastic explosives concealed within his shoes.The flight was diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston, escorted by American jet fighters, and landed without further incident.Reid was arrested and eventually sentenced to 3 life terms plus 110 years, without parole.==Incident==As Flight 63 was flying over the Atlantic Ocean, Richard Reid \u2013 an Islamic fundamentalist from the United Kingdom, and self-proclaimed Al-Qaeda operative \u2013 carried shoes that were packed with two types of explosives.He had been refused permission to board the flight the day before.Passengers on the flight complained of a smoke smell shortly after meal service.One flight attendant, Hermis Moutardier, walked the aisles of the plane to locate the source.She found Reid sitting alone near a window, attempting to light a match.Moutardier warned him that smoking was not allowed on the airplane, and Reid promised to stop.A few minutes later, Moutardier found Reid leaning over in his seat, and unsuccessfully attempted to get his attention.After she asked him what he was doing, Reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse leading into the shoe, and a lit match.He was unable to detonate the bomb: perspiration from his feet dampened the triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and prevented it from igniting.Moutardier tried grabbing Reid twice, but he pushed her to the floor each time, and she screamed for help.When another flight attendant, Cristina Jones, arrived to try to subdue him, he fought her and bit her thumb.The  tall Reid who weighed about 215 pounds (97kg) was subdued by other passengers on the aircraft and immobilized using plastic handcuffs, seatbelt extensions, and headphone cords.A doctor administered diazepam found in the flight kit of the aircraft.Many of the passengers only became aware of the situation when the pilot announced that the flight was to be diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston.Two F-15 fighter jets escorted Flight 63 to Logan Airport.The plane parked in the middle of the runway, and Reid was arrested on the ground while the rest of the passengers were bussed to the main terminal.Authorities later found over 280\u00a0grams (10\u00a0oz) of TATP and PETN hidden in the hollowed soles of Reid's shoes, enough to blow a substantial hole in the aircraft.He pleaded guilty, was convicted, sentenced to 3 life terms plus 110 years without parole and incarcerated at Supermax prison ADX Florence.== Aftermath ==Six months after the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in Queens, New York on November 12, 2001, Mohammed Mansour Jabarah agreed to cooperate with American authorities in exchange for a reduced sentence.He said that fellow Canadian Abderraouf Jdey had been responsible for the flight's destruction, using a shoe bomb similar to that found on Reid several months earlier.This claim remains unsubstantiated by the investigation into the cause of the crash; Jabarah was a known colleague of Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, and said that Reid and Jdey had both been enlisted by the al-Qaeda chief to participate in identical plots.In 2006, security procedures at US airports were changed to have people remove their shoes before proceeding through scanners, in response to this incident.The requirement was phased out for some travelers, particularly those with TSA PreCheck, in the 2010s.Flight Number AAL63 continues to be used on the route from Paris to Miami.==External links==* Bomb on Flight 63 Telegraph Media Group

Aug. 7, 2017 Pro-government supporters holding Venezuela\u2019s flag march in Caracas. Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.Yet on Sunday, critics say, an authoritarian system long in the making will be formalized, reviving memories of an era that the region had hoped was over. In defiance of international warnings, the socialist government is pushing forward with a vote to elect a constituent assembly that will have the authority to change the 1999 constitution, supplant the opposition-controlled legislature and potentially keep Maduro in power indefinitely.The opposition on Thursday called for three days of massive, nationwide protests as the government showed no willingness to back down and following the slaying of seven more demonstrators in two days. Responding to the spiraling tensions, the U.S. State Department ordered the departure of family members of American staff at its embassy in Caracas. It also authorized voluntary departures for American staff, and issued a broad travel warning for U.S. citizens.Maduro \u2014 the anointed successor of firebrand leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who died in 2013 \u2014 strongly defends the new assembly, saying it will fortify what he hails as \u201cthe communal state.\u201d While it\u2019s unclear exactly what he is seeking in a new constitution, it would likely give more power to \u201ccommunal councils\u201d in poor neighborhoods. Leaders of those councils, critics say, are government loyalists who in practice would sideline elected politicians and win direct pipelines to government funds.On the surface, the assembly vote, along with the government\u2019s pseudo-Soviet speak, hark back to old-school Marxist regimes. But many here see something perhaps more sinister emerging \u2014 a 21st-century thugocracy that rules by coercion, extortion and violence.About 100 people have died in three months of anti-government street protests. Arrests of political activists have accelerated. Bands of pro-government toughs \u2014 known as colectivos \u2014 roam poor neighborhoods, waving guns, intimidating protesters and journalists, beating opposition politicians, and warning locals to toe the government line.[How a new kind of protest movement has arisen in Venezuela]More than 7 million people voted against the establishment of the new assembly in an informal referendum July 16. Opposition parties are boycotting the election.In a country where the government is the largest employer, state workers say they are being ordered to vote Sunday, at the risk of losing their jobs. HIV patients say officials have threatened to cut off their supplies of antiretroviral drugs if they do not turn out for the election. Families risk being scratched off government food distribution rosters for not showing up \u2014 a dire outcome in a country where a socialist experiment and economic mismanagement have sparked hyperinflation and food shortages.Such threats are not idle, either. Yanelis Banco, 36 years old and nearly nine months pregnant, said her boss at the government postal service called her in along with other department heads for a talk last week. He ordered them, she said, to sign a form pledging to vote Sunday.She and five other senior staffers refused. All of them lost their jobs, she said.\u201cI\u2019m a pregnant woman who has been working in the company for 10 years and four months, so I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d fire me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do I have to sign if I don\u2019t agree? I thought the law protected me!\u201dShe added: \u201cAll the other employees are terrified. Now they\u2019re sure that if they don\u2019t vote, they\u2019ll be fired. None of them can afford that.\u201d[Stuck in a death spiral, Venezuela is borrowing money at any cost]Maduro has acknowledged that the government is pressuring public employees to vote. At a rally with public energy workers this month, he said: \u201cTake the lists of workers from all the state institutions and businesses to create a constituent committee. For each business, call all the workers and organize how they\u2019ll vote on July 30th. At the end of the day, check the list. If there are 15,000 workers, there have to be 15,000 votes, with no excuses.\u201dVenezuela\u2019s political protests have been fueled by the disastrous state of the economy, growing authoritarian rule and the government\u2019s resistance to early elections. The country\u2019s electoral council ruled against the opposition when it sought a referendum in 2016 that could have cut short Maduro\u2019s six-year term. The council also pushed back elections for governors, scheduled for 2016, to December of this year. Critics fear that the new assembly will cancel those, as well as the presidential election in 2018.The U.S. Treasury Department in February froze Vice President Tareck El Aissami\u2019s American assets over his alleged involvement in narcotics trafficking and took similar action against eight justices of the pro-government supreme court after it tried to strip power from the opposition-led legislature. On Wednesday, the Trump administration targeted 13 more Venezuelan officials, alleging violations of human rights and corruption.[Trump administration hits 13 Venezuelans with sanctions in advance of vote]Once the richest country per capita in South America due to its vast oil reserves, Venezuela was also cursed with vast disparities that kept an elite in luxury while the poor languished in slums. The result was Ch\u00e1vez, who used the petroleum wealth to launch massive social programs, even as he concentrated power. He remains much beloved by millions of Venezuelans, although many others \u2014 especially in the middle and upper classes \u2014 loathe him.Maduro\u2019s approval rating, on the other hand, is hovering around 20 percent, with opponents calling this weekend\u2019s vote the only way for him to remain in the presidential palace.He has promised Venezuelans that the assembly will herald a new era of security and stability.\u201cJuly 30th will be the birth of a historic trigger of the homeland for a new phase of peace and advancement,\u201d Maduro told a campaign rally this week.Yet many Venezuelans fear just the opposite \u2014 a deepening of official repression. It is already starting, they say.Take, for instance, 51-year-old Lisbeth A\u00f1ez, or \u201cMama Lis.\u201d For years, she was known for aiding anti-government protesters, bringing them blankets and cooking them fresh arepas, or cornmeal cakes.In May, she was arrested and charged with treason.Her case is in the hands of a military tribunal. In recent months, scores of civilians who have taken part in demonstrations or other perceived anti-government acts have been sent into the military court system, where they can face lengthy prison sentences.\u201cI can\u2019t sleep, I can\u2019t eat, even if we had enough food,\u201d said her son, Luis Gonz\u00e1lez A\u00f1ez, 23, who said he was refused entry to her trial. \u201cI have nightmares, thinking about her in jail . . . I didn\u2019t think things could get worse, but they have.\u201dGabriela Ram\u00edrez, Venezuela\u2019s former public ombudsman and a longtime Ch\u00e1vez supporter, said she feared the government would become worse than a dictatorship. \u201cWe will have a narco-authoritarian regime,\u201d she said.Ram\u00edrez, who carries around a pocket version of Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s 1999 constitution in her purse, is among the ranks of former \u201cChavistas\u201d \u2014 or Ch\u00e1vez backers \u2014 who have turned against Maduro. She has paid for it with harassment, she said, including a recent hack in which intimate photos of her and her husband were leaked on social media.\u201cThere will no longer be any check on their power,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will control everything.\u201dFollowing an opposition-called 48-hour strike, the government on Thursday issued a ban on public gatherings and protests lasting from Friday through Tuesday. The opposition responded by calling for nationwide mobilization, asking citizens to take to the streets from the Caribbean Sea to the Andes Mountains.In an interview, Freddy Guevara, an opposition leader and vice president of the National Assembly, played down the chances of any deal to suspend or cancel the vote. Former Spanish prime minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero is in Caracas, and has served as an intermediary between the government and opposition. Guevara denied reports that a deal had been offered to suspend the vote.\u201cIt is wishful thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cI am sure they are going forward with this scam, and that we are going to respond with pressure.\u201dBut even leading members of the opposition appear to be losing hope that Maduro will back down.Scenarios for what happens next range widely. Some observers suggest that social unrest and international sanctions will worsen, prompting, perhaps, a military coup or fueling an anti-government guerrilla movement. Others say the government, likely with the aid of Russia and China, will somehow manage to hold on as the country becomes an international pariah.Still others see a worst-case scenario of social implosion and anarchy.\u201cSomalia,\u201d said Henrique Capriles, an opposition leader and governor of the state of Miranda.\u201cWe could become a failed state.\u201dMariana Zu\u00f1iga contributed to this report.Read moreThings are so bad in Venezuela that people are rationing toothpasteVenezuela\u2019s paradox: people are hungry, but farmers can\u2019t feed themMaduro wants to rewrite the constitution.

{"text": "Suspected New York Bomber Wounded in Shootout with PoliceThe suspect in Saturday night's bombing in New York City that wounded 29 people is in a hospital recovering from bullet wounds after a shootout with police.Prosecutors have charged 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami with five counts of attempted murder stemming from the shootout that wounded two officers.Police arrested Rahami in Linden, New Jersey \u2014 outside Manhattan \u2014 hours after police sent out a city-wide bulletin with his picture, saying he was wanted for questioning.A bar owner in Linden called police Monday morning to complain that a man was sleeping in a doorway of his business. Officers recognized the man as Rahami, who opened fire, wounding two policemen before he was injured.None of the wounds are considered life-threatening.Police officers walk near the site where Ahmad Khan Rahami, sought in connection with a bombing in New York, was taken into custody in Linden, New Jersey, U.S., Sept. 19, 2016.The FBI is not saying how they zeroed in on Rahami as the bombing suspect. But investigators reportedly saw him on surveillance video at the bomb site in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, and near a second bomb allegedly left several blocks away. The second explosive was found before it could detonate.Investigators also reportedly found fingerprints on a bomb fragment.Video sizewidthxheightpixelsFollowing Terror Suspect Capture, New York Remains VigilantShare this video0:02:12\u25b60:00:00/0:02:12\u25b6\u25b6Direct link270p | 6.3MB360p | 9.9MB720p | 56.3MBOther bombsThe FBI wants to question Rahami about another bombing Saturday morning in Seaside Park, New Jersey, south of New York, that forced the cancellation of a charity road race.

Again, no one was hurt.FILE - Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials label and collect evidence near the site of an explosion which took place on Saturday night in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, Sept. 18, 2016.Rahami's alleged motive for the bombings is unknown.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Rahami is the only suspect so far. The mayor on Monday said there is every reason to believe the bombings were acts of terrorism, and the FBI is looking for any links to foreign terror groups.Obama: We have to be vigilantSpeaking in New York, President Barack Obama said the investigation is moving rapidly and that everyone is working together to get to the bottom of what happened. He said terrorists and extremists want to hurt innocent people, inspire fear and disrupt life.President Barack Obama speaks about last Saturday's bombing in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood in New York, Sept. 19, 2016.\"We have to be vigilant and aggressive, both on preventing senseless acts of violence but also making sure that we find those who carry out such acts and bring them to justice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don't succumb to that fear.\"One New Yorker told VOA that the bombing was unsettling, but not surprising.\"There is a security to this city. Sure there are days where I have my doubts about that, but because I do feel this camaraderie in the city, I do feel relatively safe.\"Suspect called friendlySuspected bomber Rahami was born in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He and his family run a fried-chicken restaurant in Linden that has a steady number of loyal customers. But it also had trouble with the city of Linden for what neighbors said was round-the-clock noise and crowds at the eatery.Some of the restaurant's customers say they are shocked that Rahami is a suspect, calling him friendly. They say he let local bands practice in the back of the restaurant, and gave them free food.New York City Afghan community leader Masjid Dar al Taqwa condemned the bombings.\"Everyone ... is shocked and saddened by what has happened,\" he told VOA. \"They condemn all forms of violence.

According to Reuters, at least seven national guard soldiers were injured.Local police downed a drone that attacked the scene where officials, including Maduro, were present.According to Venezuela's Minister of Information, not one, but several, drones allegedly fitted with explosives attacked the country's leadership during a military parade.Meanwhile, local media outlets report that some explosive-carrying drones failed to reach their targets, crashing in a residential area in the center of Caracas, causing fire and large plumes of smoke.#Venezuela Fire in a building in #Caracas, possibly after the drone that aimed to kill Maduro crashed pic.twitter.com/nDzNVnwJ78 \u2014 Guy Elster (@guyelster) 4 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 2018 \u0433.The Venezuelan leader as well as the rest of the political and military leadership of the Latin American country feel fine and were not injured during the attack, according to the president of a state-owned bank Miguel Perez Abad.\"Soon, our national government will inform about what happened on the Bolivar avenue \u2026 Our President Nicolas Maduro feels fine as well as the supreme political and military command of the revolution,\" Perez Abad wrote on Twitter.Venezuela has been recently mired a political and socioeconomic crisis, which many blame on dropping oil prices as well as the leadership\u2019s decisions. The nation experienced months of mass protests last year, which initially were a response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to severely limit the parliament's legislative powers.The protests in Venezuela were further fueled by the election of a new lawmaking body, known as the Constituent Assembly, initiated by Maduro with the aim of rewriting the constitution.", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> DamageDestroyDisableDismantle downed <extra_id_0> Artifact drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> DamagerDestroyer police <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Crash crashing <extra_id_0> Vehicle drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Crash crashed <extra_id_0> Vehicle drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Place Caracas <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact address <extra_id_0> Communicator Nicolas Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact speech <extra_id_0> Communicator Nicolas Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Contact delivering <extra_id_0> Communicator Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Transportation evacuated <extra_id_0> PassengerArtifact Maduro <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Injure injured <extra_id_0> Victim soldiers <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacked <extra_id_0> Instrument drone <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attacked <extra_id_0> Instrument drones <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Target country's leadership <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Attack attack  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protests  <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> Demonstrate protests <extra_id_0> Topic the Constituent Assembly <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}

{"text": "On 17 January 2019, a vehicle was driven into the General Santander National Police Academy in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The truck forced its way into the facility, hit a wall and detonated, killing 22 people (including the perpetrator) and injuring 68 others. Suicide attacks are unusual in Colombia. The car contained about  of pentolite. It was the deadliest attack on the Colombian capital since the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing and the first terrorist attack on the capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing. The National Liberation Army (ELN) accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the Colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire.==Background===== Colombian conflict ===The Colombian conflict started in 1964, although systematic violence in the country can be dated since the end of the 19th century (Thousand Days' War). The National Liberation Army (ELN) is one of the most prominent participants of the ongoing conflict. For decades, residents of Bogot\u00e1 lived in fear of being a victim of a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar's Medell\u00edn drug cartel. But as Colombia's conflict has wound down, and the nation's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.Sporadic attacks have affected the city since the peace deal was initiated. The most prominent was an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 which killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary's Movement for the bombing.=== Peace dialogue ===The 2016 peace deal between the FARC and Colombian government resulted in the ELN gaining strength in the region. The Colombian government has attempted to establish peace dialogue with the ELN since 2017, though ELN groups have rejected conditions placed by the government, such as the end of criminal actions including violent attacks and kidnappings. The ELN, however, persisted that the Colombian government should continue dialogue without making any demands towards the group. Between 2017 and up until the attack, Colombian officials stated that the ELN had participated in at least 400 terrorist attacks in the nation since dialogue began, including the shoot down of a civilian helicopter and the kidnapping of its occupants.=== ELN in Venezuela ===According to InSight Crime, the ELN and FARC dissidents allegedly met together in Venezuela to form a potential alliance in October 2018. Sources based in the Arauca department in Colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. It was also alleged that former FARC commander Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez participated in the talks with the ELN.In November 2018, InSight Crime also reported that the ELN was present in over twelve Venezuelan states, spanning from the Colombia-Venezuela border in the west across Venezuela and into Brazil and Guyana to the east. Insight Crime states that Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was tolerant of the ELN, explaining that \"ELN\u2019s expansion in Venezuela has been marked by the Maduro administration\u2019s inaction and even encouragement towards the group\", with reports from Venezuelan NGO Fundaci\u00f3n Redes that the Venezuelan military had possibly armed ELN members.==Events===== Planning ===Attorney General  identified the perpetrator as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, known as \"Mocho Kiko\" because of his missing hand due to a previous explosion, a 57-year-old from the northern department of Boyac\u00e1. Rojas is alleged to have been involved with the ELN for three decades and served as an intelligence chief for a branch of the group. Since 2011, Rojas is alleged to have been teaching guerrilla militants in Venezuela how to construct explosives.Ricardo Carvajal, who was previously investigated for drug trafficking in 2012 but was acquitted of the charges, allegedly contracted Rojas for the bombing due to his experience. The bombing, according to Colombian authorities, had been planned for more than ten months. In May 2018, Colombian records show that Rojas purchased a 1993 Nissan Patrol from Mauricio Mosquera, who was previously charged with terrorism and rebellion. On 27 July 2018, the vehicle was officially inspected in Arauca, Arauca, a city found on the border of Colombia and Venezuela where the ELN mainly controls territory.=== Attack ===The authorities stated that on 17 January 2019 at 9:30am, Rojas drove his grey 1993 Nissan Patrol loaded with  of pentolite to the campus of the General Santander National Police Academy and dropped off a passenger at a nearby bus stop. Rojas then reportedly drove his truck down a side street used for deliveries to make his way onto the campus. When a detection dog signaled explosives on the vehicle, the driver forced his vehicle through a security checkpoint and struck security guards. The explosives in the truck were then detonated near the women's dormitories at the police academy as students were leaving a promotion ceremony. It is unknown if the driver detonated the explosives or if it was possibly the individual he left near the bus stop who remotely triggered the device.In the immediate aftermath, the authorities began investigating Rojas's possible connections to either the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla movement, the Clan \u00dasuga organized crime gang, or FARC dissidents.=== Initial investigations ===On 18 January, Defence Minister  identified Rojas Rodr\u00edguez as a long-time member of the ELN, within which he served as an explosives expert. Investigators were able to identify Rojas with security camera footage and fingerprints from his remaining hand.A second individual, who Attorney General Mart\u00ednez said \"had participated in the attack\", was arrested in Bogot\u00e1 at 2:30am on the day following the attack.  The individual was identified as Ricardo Carvajal after he allegedly confessed to the bombings over a telephone call investigators intercepted. He was found with a \"combatant's manual\" and numerous coveralls. Carvajal Salgar denied that he was involved in the attack and his family stated that the coveralls were used for the jobs he worked.According to Colombian authorities, there are on-going operations throughout Bogot\u00e1 and the department of Arauca to capture other individuals suspected of having been involved in the attack, and that the ELN was responsible despite the organization not taking claim for the attack as it has done in the past.=== Peace dialogue ends ===President Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez announced on 18 January that peace dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the ELN was officially suspended. Duque also demanded that Cuba extradite the ten ELN leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their Interpol Red Notices, and he criticized Venezuela for providing refuge for the ELN on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In response to the request, Cuba's Foreign Minister announced that Cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties.The President of the National Constituent Assembly of Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello, denied any Venezuelan involvement in the attacks on 18 January. On 21 January, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called for a \"concrete response\" from the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela on whether the ELN was present in Venezuela, explaining that prior to the attack, the Colombian government asked the Venezuelan government on the potential presence of ELN groups in Venezuela without a response. Holmes Trujillo also stated that the Maduro government had taken \"evasive positions\" when speaking about the ELN.===Claim of responsibility===ELN accepted the responsibility for the attack, saying the bombing was carried out in retaliation for the Colombian government not honoring the ceasefire by carrying out attacks on its camps. It justified that government and the cadres of its security forces had therefore become legitimate targets and called for resuming peace dialogue. High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos spoke out against its members being sheltered anymore now that it had claimed responsibility.==International reactions==A foreign national, identified as a female cadet from Ecuador, was killed in the attack, while three nationals from Panama, one from the United States and another also from Ecuador were wounded. Their respective governments have expressed their condemnation for the attack and assistance to their citizens.* Cuba: Cuba shared condolences with Colombia, with its foreign ministry stating Cuba \"will act with strict respect for the Protocols of Dialogue and Peace signed by the Government and the ELN, including the Protocol in Case of a Rupture in Negotiations\".* Ecuador: President Len\u00edn Moreno lamented the death of Erika Chic\u00f3, the Ecuadorian cadet killed in the attack, and expressed his condolences to Colombia. He also announced that he was to send Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner to Bogot\u00e1 accompanied by Chic\u00f3's relatives.* Panama: The Panamanian embassy in Bogot\u00e1 expressed its indignation at the attack, and provided a phone number for information about Panamanian cadets affected.* United States: The Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Kimberly Breier condemned the bombing and said: \"Our condolences and sympathies go to the victims and family members of those killed\", while the U.S. Embassy in Bogot\u00e1 offered its \"help in investigating this reprehensible attack\".Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and the Organization of American States also condemned the attack.==References==", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Transportation driven

{"text": "In Boston Marathon Bombing Trial, a Search for Justice and Closure CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS \u2014\u00a0Three short paragraphs - hand-written, in Russian, on lined, notebook paper - sat atop a stack of old newspapers next to the television in the newly vacant third floor apartment at 410 Norfolk Street.Federal Bureau of Investigation agents had done the first of two searches of the East Cambridge apartment, rented for more than a decade by an ethnic Chechen family, the Tsarnaevs.FILE - This April 15, 2013, photo shows medical workers aiding injured people at the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon following an explosion.Days earlier, on April 15, 2013, two pressure cookers, packed with nails and ball bearings, exploded near the Boston Marathon finish line, killing three, maiming scores and shattering the celebration of the world\u2019s oldest annual marathon.The Tsarnaevs\u2019 two sons had been implicated: Tamerlan, 26, had been killed during a police shoot-out. Dzhokhar, 19, was in police custody.A friend, who had known the Tsarnaev family for years and was very close to all of them, discovered the paper in the apartment and recognized the handwriting as Tamerlan\u2019s:\"They said: how many small armies had defeated larger armies by the will of Allah. The Prophet called to Allah with the words: give me the perseverance in all my undertakings and the resoluteness to follow the correct path. If Allah will give you support, then no one will defeat you. If he removes this support, then who will help you in place of nothing? Let the devout rely on Allah.\"A scrap of paper, featuring Quranic musings, written in Russian and shared with VOA, was found in the Cambridge apartment by a close family friend and identified by the friend as Tamerlan's handwriting.The writing, shared exclusively with VOA, is a glimpse into the mind of the man considered to be the mastermind of the Boston terrorist attack.Nearly 21 months later, the scars of the bombing - psychological and physical - are deep and raw in the Boston area as survivors, witnesses, Americans and Chechens, from Boston and Grozny, have groped to understand the motivations of the Tsarnaev brothers.VOA has retraced some of the key steps leading up to the bombing, interviewing members of the Chechen \u00e9migr\u00e9 community and others who had close dealings with the Tsarnaev family.The story that emerges is one of a troubled family buffeted by the challenges of adapting to American culture and by the undercurrents of war and radicalism wracking their ethnic homeland.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is seen in this law enforcement bulletin, distributed in the days after the April 15, 2013, bombing.The best hope, however, for understanding what led to April 15, 2013, lies with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, whose trial on 30 terrorism and related charges opens Monday in Boston\u2019s federal court just a few miles from the marathon\u2019s finish line.\u201cThey took the innocence from us, that they did take,\u201d said Jason Rosenberg, a Boston-area lawyer who represents a man once cared for by the Tsarnaev family. \u201cYou think you\u2019re immune from [terrorism], it only happens elsewhere.\u201d\u201cWe think: \u2018they can\u2019t be these beasts, but we all know that a human being \u2026 can be caring and loving to someone else and then be a horrendous person,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can be, and are, one and the same, the same person.\u201d\u2018Why did you do it, Tamerlan, why?\u2019A caring and loving person is what Tamerlan seemed like less than four weeks before the bombs sent panic through runners and spectators lining the few hundred yards along Boston\u2019s Boylston Street leading up to the finish line.Around March 20, Tamerlan, along with his American wife, Katherine, traveled to the outskirts of Manchester, New Hampshire, to visit another Chechen family who had fled the region in the early 2000s: Musa Khadzhimuradov, his wife Madina, and their two children.Among the two dozen or so Chechen families living in Boston and southern New Hampshire, it was common to mark holidays together, to attend one another\u2019s barbecues, to carry on traditions from back in Chechnya. Tamerlan had come, Khadzhimuradov said, to say goodbye to Khadzhimuradov\u2019s mother-in-law, who was returning to Chechnya.Khadzhimuradov, who formerly worked as a bodyguard to Chechen separatist leader Akhmed Zakayev, said he had been in touch with Tamerlan since 2006, when they met at a Chechen holiday celebration in Boston. At 755 Boylston St., just a few steps from the finish line of the Boston Marathon, there is little indication of the carnage of the 2013 bombing, except for a small makeshift memorial tied to a narrow tree.During the March visit, both Khadzhimuradov and his wife Madina recalled, Tamerlan played happily with his young daughter Zahara, and chatted with the Khadzhimuradovs\u2019 own daughter.\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about war or religion, nothing,\u201d Musa Khadzhimuradov told VOA. \u201cHe was happy. Maybe he had a double life or something, but he was playing with his child.\u201d\u201cThe way [Katherine] looked at him, she couldn't take her eyes of him,\u201d Madina said. \u201cTamerlan was chatting, playing with his daughter.\u201d \u201cI see him almost every night in my dreams,\u201d she said. \u201cHe looks just as always: very handsome and calm. I cry and I ask him: \u2018Why did you do it, Tamerlan, why?\u2019 And he answers: \u2018I didn't want to do it here.\u2019\u201dBut according to FBI affidavits, the grand jury indictment and other details made public in media reports, Tamerlan was plotting something destructive.On at least two occasions in the months prior to April 15, Tamerlan had visited a Manchester firing range just a few miles from the Khadzhimuradov apartment to practice shooting. On March 20, Dzhokhar, who was a student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, joined Tamerlan at the range.Carey McLoud, an owner and manager of the Manchester Firing Range Line, refused to answer VOA\u2019s questions about the Tsarnaev brothers.Tamerlan had also traveled to the New Hampshire coastal town of Seabrook to buy fireworks, and gather gunpowder to fuel the pressure cooker bombs. On February 6, at around 7:40 p.m., Tamerlan stopped at Phantom Fireworks and paid $199 cash for a package called \u201cLock and Load,\u201d and took advantage of a \u201cbuy-one-get-one-free deal.\u201d He left with 48 mortars and the equivalent of eight pounds of low explosive powder, according to prosecutors.On Feb. 6, 2013, Tamerlan Tsarnaev traveled to New Hampshire, to buy fireworks, as part of preparations to build pressure cooker bombs.\u201cHe asked \u2018what was the loudest, most powerful firework we had?\u201d store manager April Walton told VOA. \u201cIt\u2019s what 80 percent of our customers ask for.\u201dSometime around April 5, just 10 days before the bombings, Tamerlan went online and ordered electronic components that could be used in making bombs, according to the grand jury indictment. Those components were delivered by mail to the Norfolk Street apartment.In recent years, some members of the Tsarnaev family, including the boys\u2019 mother Zubeidat, had begun openly expressing their Muslim faith. They dressed in traditional conservative clothing and attended prayer services, mainly at the Islamic Society of Boston\u2019s Cambridge mosque four blocks from 410 Norfolk Street. Once a fashionable and flashy dresser, Zubeidat had taken to wearing headscarves, long skirts and long-sleeved dresses and shirts. She reportedly started wearing gloves constantly so as to avoid touching the hands of unrelated males, such as shop clerks or tollbooth workers. The Tsarnaev boys\u2019 sisters, Bella and Ailina, also began wearing headscarves.Outburst at the mosquePrior to November 2012, the Tsarnaevs didn\u2019t stand out among the hundreds who attended prayers regularly, said the Cambridge mosque\u2019s acting imam, Ismail Fenni.That month, a guest speaker gave a sermon about the importance of Muslims accepting public holidays like Thanksgiving. Tamerlan stood up and angrily interrupted the speaker, calling him wrong.Fenni said he and other elders spoke to Tamerlan and reminded him of the mosque rules of behavior and decorum. Tamerlan nodded and said he understood, Fenni recalled.Elders at the Cambridge mosque of the Islamic Society of Boston said the November 2012 outburst by Tamerlan Tsarnaev was the first time anyone really took note of him.Then in January 2013, at the prayer service before the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Tamerlan again stood up and interrupted the sermon, as the guest speaker discussed how Muslims should accept the civil rights leader.\u201cThere was nothing really for us to be worried about with him before his explosive outbursts,\u201d Fenni said. \u201cBefore then, he was just a face in the crowd.\u201dThat first outburst had occurred four months after Tamerlan returned from a trip to Russia\u2019s North Caucasus, where Chechnya is located.Between January and July 2012, Tamerlan spent some of his time in Makhachkala, the capital of the Dagestan region, working with his father Anzor, who had arrived in the region in April. Anzor was newly divorced from Zubeidat, according to the family friend, who asked not to be identified publicly while discussing the Tsarnaev\u2019s family dynamics.Like much of Russia's North Caucasus, Dagestan, shown here in red, has struggled with violence spilling over from neighboring Chechnya.The stated reason for Tamerlan\u2019s trip in January 2012, according to the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, was obtain a Russian passport: Tamerlan held a Kyrgyz passport, the result of his early childhood in Kyrgyzstan, where many Chechens lived after being expelled from their homeland by Stalin in the 1940s.But last year, Irina Gordienko, an investigative reporter for Novaya Gazeta, reported that Tamerlan didn\u2019t actually apply for a passport until the end of June, more than six months after arriving.Gordienko also reported Tamerlan had been in contact with two militants wanted by Russian security agencies. One, a Russian-Canadian named William Plotnikov, was killed by police on July 14, 2012. Within two days, Tamerlan left the region to fly back to the United States.\u201cPeople in Dagestan told me he dressed strangely, his behavior was unusual,\u201d Gordienko said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t very knowledgeable about Islam.\u201dWhere Tamerlan (L) saw some success as a boxer, Dzhokhar (R) captained his high school wrestling team.In the United States, Tamerlan had been a show-off from a young age, always seeking attention, the family friend told VOA. He loved to sing, to play violin and to dance. He was smart academically, but he never seemed focused, the friend said: he talked about being an accountant, but he took only a handful of classes at Bunker Hill Community College.Tamerlan was athletic, as well: he trained at a boxing club in Somerville, next door to Cambridge. His boxing career, nurtured by his father Anzor, hit a high point in February 2010 with a regional trophy. Then it petered out.\u201cHe didn\u2019t seem to know where he was going,\u201d the friend said.Over the years, Tamerlan pulled income from short-term jobs.In 2009, he worked as a driver for a Watertown-based elder care facility that catered to Russian immigrants. He also helped his mother with her work as a home health aide in the Newton home of Donald and Rosemary Larking.Donald Larking was an older man who became so close to Tamerlan that he attended prayer services at the Cambridge mosque, according to Rosenberg, Larking\u2019s lawyer. Larking also had constant discussions with Tamerlan about politics and espoused dark conspiracy theories about the attacks of September 11, 2001.Through Rosenberg, Donald Larking refused to be interviewed for this article.Pictured is Tamerlan (C) Tsarnaev, accompanied by his father Anzor (L), mother Zubeidat and uncle Muhamad Suleimanov (R), in this photo courtesy of the Suleimanova family.Tamerlan was interviewed by the FBI in 2011, at the request of the lead Russian security agency, the FSB, which had been monitoring Tamerlan\u2019s alleged interactions with radical groups. Chechnya had by then suffered through the second of two wars since 1994, and the turmoil had spawned a terrorist insurgency, influenced by Islamic extremists, that had affected the entire North Caucasus.According to an FBI statement, the Russians reported that Tamerlan \u201cwas a follower of radical Islam\u201d and \u201chad changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country\u2019s region to join unspecified underground groups.\u201dThe youngest TsarnaevDzhokhar, by contrast, was considered smart but quiet, always in his older siblings\u2019 shadow, according to friends and acquaintances.When the family moved to the Boston area, Dzhokhar, then 8, spent second grade at an elementary school in Needham, a Boston suburb. He lived with the family of a prominent Chechen doctor, Khassan Baiev.Baiev\u2019s daughter Maryam remembers Dzhokhar, who later called himself Jahar, as a happy boy who was good at math, who liked to rollerblade and bicycle around the neighborhood playground.As they grew older, however, she said she had few interactions with him, only occasionally by Facebook.\u201cI remember when I saw him on TV\u2026 I ran straight to my brother, and said, \u201cDid you see who was on TV?\u2019 He said \u201cYeah, I saw it,\u2019\u201d Baieva, 21, said. \u201cI was more upset. I felt bad for [Dzhokhar] and I felt bad for his parents, everything he put them through.Friends say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was smart and quiet, always in the shadow of his older siblings.\u201cI felt heartbroken, betrayed at the time. It was scary, because I didn\u2019t know how people were going to look at me after, what people were going to think of me afterward,\u201d she said.Unlike with Tamerlan - the trip to Russia, the mosque outburst, the initial FBI investigation - Dzhokhar\u2019s involvement in the attack was even more baffling. According to friends and acquaintances, he never elicited attention or worry prior to April 15, 2013: not from neighbors or friends, not from school, not from law enforcement.At Cambridge\u2019s Rindge and Latin high school, Dzhokhar was known as low-key, laid-back and friendly. He was captain of the public school\u2019s wrestling team, an honor student and the recipient of a small scholarship from the city of Cambridge.At the Dartmouth campus of the University of Massachusetts, Dzhokhar was known as a middling student and, according to The Boston Globe, an active dealer of marijuana.\u201cDzhokhar kept to himself, he was smart. He made his own choices,\u201d the family friend said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the center of attention; he was always off to the side.\u201d\u201cI never worried about Dzhokhar,\u201d the friend said.In the months immediately before the bombing, the Norfolk Street apartment was occupied only by Tamerlan, his wife and their daughter. Katherine worked as a home health aide. His parents were both living in Russia. His sisters had moved out.On the Dartmouth campus, according to prosecutors, there were indications that Dzhokhar was exploring violent acts. Sometime in the spring of 2013, Dzhokhar downloaded to his computer several books and pamphlets espousing radical Islamist ideas.One was a book that contained a passage by a well-known al-Qaida propagandist, Anwar al-Awlaki. Another was a copy of the summer 2010 issue of Inspire magazine, an English-language publication by al-Qaida\u2019s affiliate on the Arabian Peninsula.The issue contained detailed instructions about making a pressure cooker bomb using common materials in an article titled: \u201cHow to Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.\u201dFireworks found inside a backpack belonging to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are seen in a handout photo released by the FBI, May 2, 2013.After his arrest, investigators later found Dzhokhar\u2019s college dormitory room, his computer and a backpack containing fireworks that had been emptied of gunpowder.The night of April 15, Dzhokhar sent a friend\u2014 the son of a prominent Boston-area Chechen \u00e9migr\u00e9\u2014 a text message asking him if he was at the marathon and was OK.On April 18, as police widened their search for the alleged bombers, the brothers shot and killed a police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, according to the grand jury indictment. Hours later, as the manhunt began closing in, Dzhokhar sent another text message to a college classmate saying: \u201cIf you want u can go to my room and take what you want.\u201dIn the early hours of April 19, with Tamerlan dead and the suburban town of Watertown resembling a war zone, Dzhokhar, bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds, huddled in a boat parked in a backyard driveway.Inside the hull and on an overhead beam, he scrawled several messages that give some insight into his motivations, according to the indictment:\u201cThe U.S. Government is killing our innocent civilians; I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished; We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all; Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam.... stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.\u201dTrial as closureFor victims, for friends of the Tsarnaev family, for Chechen immigrants, for marathon runners, for arguably just about everyone in Massachusetts, the trial scheduled for Monday is likely to be a riveting spectacle.FILE - Demonstrators asserting that evidence in the Boston Marathon bombing was fabricated stand outside the federal courthouse ahead of a pre-trial conference for suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in Boston, Dec. 18, 2014.For some, it will be a chance at vengeance and punishment for a young man whose seeming potential crashed to a halt on April 15, 2013.For others, it will be a chance at learning something more about why a laid-back, average, 19-year-old college student decided to participate in a horrific attack on bystanders celebrating a beloved sporting event.\u201cI want to know why he did it. I want to know why he would go out of his way, what did he need when he already has everything,\u201d said Baieva, the childhood friend.On December 18, Dzhokhar appeared at the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse, on Boston\u2019s waterfront, his last appearance before the formal beginning of his trial. It was his first public appearance since July 2013, when, still visibly wounded from the manhunt, he told the court he entered a plea of not guilty.A courtroom sketch depicts Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, December 18, 2014.During the 30-minute appearance on December 18, Dzhokhar \u2013 sporting a shock of bushy hair and a thin beard \u2013 played nervously with his hands and smiled occasionally when talking with his lawyers.He stood when the judge addressed him directly, and he responded respectfully, saying \u201cyes, sir,\u201d and \u201cno, sir.\u201dFederal prosecutors have indicated they will seek the death penalty if Dzhokhar is convicted. His defense lawyers are expected to seek leniency from the jury, arguing that Dzhokhar was an accomplice, but decidedly under the sway of his older brother.Defense lawyers have also made a flurry of last-minute court filings, seeking to either delay the trial or move it out of state. A filing last Monday by Tsarnaev\u2019s lead lawyer, Judy Clarke, suggested that the defense was trying reach a deal with the prosecution: possibly a guilty plea in exchange for a life prison sentence.\u201cIf the government remains unwilling to relent in seeking death, and the case therefore must be tried, the defense is asking for nothing more than a trial that is fair,\u201d she wrote.A couple embraces at a memorial on Boylston Street to the bombing victims, April 21, 2013.The trial portends renewed grief not only for the victims of the bombing. For the refugees of the Chechen wars and oppression, who came to the New England over the past two decades, settling in the United States was a chance for them to rebuild a semblance of peace and prosperity. The Boston Marathon bombings shattered that dream.Upon reaching the United States, \u201cfor the first time in my life I felt that I, my kids, my family \u2013 that we are safe and happy here. I prayed for America every evening,\u201d said Madina Khadzhimuradova, the Tsarnaev family friend.\u201cNow it is all gone. I am living in fear again, just like in the old times in Chechnya. We spoke about moving somewhere else, but where can we go? There is no place for Chechens on this Earth.\u201d", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> Attack Bombing <extra_id_0> Place Boston <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> TrialHearing Trial
