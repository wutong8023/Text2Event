Getty 9/21 Former PwC employees found guilty in ' Luxleaks ' tax scandal - June 2016 Two ex- PricewaterhouseCoopers staffers were found guilty in Luxembourg of stealing confidential tax files that helped unleash a global scandal over generous fiscal deals for hundreds of international companies . Antoine Deltour and Raphael Halet face suspended sentences of 12 months and 9 months and were ordered to pay fines of \u20ac 1,500 ( \u00a3 1,230 ) and \u20ac 1,000 ( \u00a3 822 ) for their role in the so - called LuxLeaks scandal . Despite the minimal sentences , the ruling was described by Deltour \u2019s lawyer as \u201c shocking \u201d and \u201c a terrible anomaly . \u201d The ruling \u201c puts on guard future whistle - blowers , \u201d Deltour told reporters . The LuxLeaks revelations sped beyond Luxembourg , causing European Union regulators to expand a tax - subsidy probe and propose new laws to fight corporate tax dodging , while EU lawmakers created a special committee to probe fiscal deals across the 28-nation bloc .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> judicialconsequences guilty <extra_id_0> defendant PwC employees <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> crime tax scandal <extra_id_1> <extra_id_0> place Luxembourg <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
