The same month that WikiLeaks.org went live , in December of 2006 , Assange posted an essay on his blog , \u201c Conspiracy as Governance , \u201d in which he explained his theory that authoritarian regimes \u2014 and western political parties \u2014 maintain power by conspiring to keep the public in the dark , through \u201c collaborative secrecy , working to the detriment of a population . \u201d In order for the people to regain control of the political system , Assange argued , it is necessary to find ways of \u201c throttling the conspiracy , \u201d like disrupting the ability of the conspirators to communicate secretly .

Assange \u2019s attack on the DNC certainly revealed hypocrisy within the party , and led to the resignations of four senior officials , but his decision to not redact personal information from those documents \u2014 or from a second cache of emails hacked from a Turkish political party \u2014 also led to criticism from some longtime supporters , including Edward Snowden , the NSA whistleblower .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> collaborate fax <extra_id_0> participant parties <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
