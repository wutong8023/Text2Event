Story Continued Below While Clinton is clear that she never had any intention to mishandle classified documents , a fact that FBI Director James Comey noted as a factor in his decision not to recommend any charges against the former secretary of state , answers she gave to FBI agents during a July 2 interview are likely to reinforce the Republican campaign talking point that she lied to cover up her own recklessness with government secrets .
