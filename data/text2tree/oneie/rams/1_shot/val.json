Another tranche released Monday -- a rare bit of good news for the imploding Trump campaign -- revealed a ferocious internal battle at Bill Clinton 's charitable foundation , with daughter Chelsea accusing foundation executive Doug Band of acting in his own financial self - interest .", "event": "<extra_id_0> <extra_id_0> publicstatementinperson professed <extra_id_0> communicator he <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1> <extra_id_1>"}
